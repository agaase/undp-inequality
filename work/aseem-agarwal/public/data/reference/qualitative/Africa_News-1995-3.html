<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE - Preliminary indications point to a 'favourable'<BR>rain season in Southern Africa, although warm sea<BR>temperatures off the Angolan coast could affect seasonal<BR>distribution, a South African weather expert said on<BR>Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview, a spokesman at Cape Town University's<BR>Department of Oceanography, said indications at present<BR>showed the region would experience average rainfall.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he said, it was still too early to say which<BR>parts of southern Africa, currently in the throes of another<BR>devastating dry period, would have the heaviest rains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'I would say the forecast for this year points to slightly<BR>above normal rains in the late summer which should give good<BR>maize yields. However, the sea temperatures off the Angolan<BR>coast are still warm and this is not a good sign as it tends<BR>to pull rain to Angola rather than to Zimbabwe,' said the<BR>spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maize is southern Africa's leading staple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spokesman said a detailed analysis of weather patterns<BR>in the region would be presented at a major conference on<BR>climatic change to be held in Harare, Zimbabwe, in the next<BR>fortnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, the department forecast below normal rainfall<BR>in the region, mainly due to unfavourable wind movements<BR>across the central Indian Ocean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Zimbabwe, the 1994/95 rain season ended more than two<BR>months prematurely, leading to widespread crop failures, with<BR>output of the staple maize crop cut by over 45 percent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Panafrican News Agency<BR>September 14, 1995<BR>by Mildred Mulenga, PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - Zambia's opposition Zambia Democratic Congress<BR>(ZDC), Thursday criticised government's awarding of a<BR>contract to update national voters registers to an Israeli<BR>company and called for its immediate withdrawal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party vice president in charge of women's affairs Euleria<BR>Zulu claimed at a press briefing in Lusaka Thursday that<BR>government had fraudulently awarded the contract in order to<BR>rig the country's scheduled 1996 presidential and general<BR>elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Frederick Chiluba's Movement for Multiparty<BR>Democracy (MMD) government has announced that it had awarded<BR>an Israeli company, 'Nikuv Computers Israel', the USD 18<BR>million contract to update the voter's registers ahead of<BR>this year's local government and the 1996 general elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zulu said Thursday that the contract was in breach of<BR>Zambia's electoral laws which recognised the National<BR>Electoral Commission as the only body allowed to deal with<BR>electoral matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She accused some officials in Chiluba's government of<BR>having influenced the contract for personal gain and<BR>threatened that her party could consider boycotting the<BR>elections if government did not relent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'We are disturbed at the idea of awarding the tender to a<BR>foreign company. Apart from subverting the electoral process,<BR>it is also to benefit the MMD and a clique of known MMD<BR>leaders to receive commissions and sub-contracts,' Zulu<BR>charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ten other companies, both local and foreign, had submitted<BR>tenders at lower quotations than the Israeli firm, according<BR>to figures given by the opposition party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government Wednesday announced the cancellation of a<BR>scheduled emergency parliamentary session called for<BR>September 23 which ZDC president Dean Mung'omba said Thursday<BR>had been intended to amend the electoral law to regularise<BR>the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main opposition United National Independence<BR>Party(Unip) of former president Kenneth Kaunda had recently<BR>sought a court injunction restraining government from<BR>engaging a private firm to undertake the voters registration<BR>exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The injunction was subsequently dismissed after the courts<BR>discovered that one of the petitioning parties had in fact<BR>not signed the application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia has some 2 million registered voters of the<BR>estimated population of 9 million. A similar figure is<BR>expected to be added on to the registers following<BR>government's decision to lower the voting age from 18 to 16.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNITED NATIONS - Amnesty International, a human rights<BR>organisation, has called for 'tough action' to prevent<BR>further killings by the Rwandan army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This demand came after some 100 people were shot dead<BR>Monday in Kanama, Northwest Rwandan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The Rwandan government should take immediate action to<BR>prevent further extrajudicial executions by the Rwandan<BR>Patriotic Army (RPA),' the agency said from its United<BR>Nations office in New York. It welcomed statements by the<BR>Rwandan Vice President and Defence Minister, Paul Kagame,<BR>regretting the killings. The government has ordered an<BR>inquiry into the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Amnesty said that investigation must conform to<BR>international standards and its results implemented and made<BR>public. 'As a minimum, the Rwandan government should make<BR>clear all RPA officials that deliberate, arbitrary or<BR>indiscriminate killings of unarmed civilians are grave<BR>violations of human rights all will not be tolerated,' it<BR>said. Civilians, mostly women and children, were killed when<BR>soldiers reportedly opened fire on villagers in Kanama, near<BR>the border with Zaire. Reports say that this was apparently<BR>in reprisal for an ambush by Hutu militia who attacked<BR>government soldiers, killing one lieutenant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shootings were the single largest of such incidents by<BR>government soldiers since several thousand people were killed<BR>at the Kibeho camp April 22. Monday's event, now being<BR>described by the United Nations as a massacre, took place as<BR>amnesty released a 45-page report recommending that the<BR>international community prevent further human rights<BR>violations in Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi. Both countries<BR>are troubled by the same ethnic conflict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE - Fears that some of Africa's top athletes may have<BR>boycotted the All-Africa Games being held in Zimbabwe were<BR>allayed on Friday following reports that South African poll<BR>Volter Okkerts Britts and Namibian sprinter Frankie Frederiks<BR>will now participate in the continent's sporting<BR>extravaganza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Britts and Frederiks are African record holders and<BR>athletes of international acclaim having excelled in various<BR>international meets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britts, who cleared 6.03 metres earlier this year in a<BR>poll vault event, is a strong contender for a gold medal at<BR>the games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A senior official of the games organising committee said<BR>Britts, who was due to have attended an event on Friday in<BR>Tokyo, Japan, would now be available for the Harare<BR>competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Pressure has been brought to bear on the two athletes<BR>forcing them to reconsider their decisions not to participate<BR>in this important event,' said the official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of Africa's top athletes shunned the games opting to<BR>participate in international competitions with prize money<BR>which coincide with the 10-day all Africa games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international Olympic committee, embarrassed by the<BR>boycott, said in future it will liaise with other sporting<BR>federations to ensure the games do not coincide with the All<BR>Africa Games.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha's Deputy, Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya emerged from a<BR>meeting of the reconstituted 26-member PRC to inform anxious<BR>journalists late Friday the Council had yet to reach a<BR>decision on the coup suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those convicted in July and given unspecified sentences<BR>include former Head of State Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo and his<BR>former deputy Maj. Gen. Shehu Musa Yar'adua.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The military as an institution must necessarily<BR>subordinate itself to the constitution of the Federal<BR>Republic of Nigeria,' the general added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military is considered a major problem in the populous<BR>west African country, which has seen some 10 failed and<BR>successful coups and 25 years of army rule in its 35 years of<BR>independence from Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pro-democracy groups at home and abroad are mounting<BR>pressures on Abacha to return Nigeria to democratic rule<BR>without delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abacha government has said it would announce its<BR>transition programme on 1 October after he received a draft<BR>constitution submitted in July by the National Constitutional<BR>Conference.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS - Nigeria is using the United Nations 50th<BR>anniversary this year to reinforce its bid for permanent<BR>membership of the security council, the country's information<BR>minister Walter Ofonogaro said in Lagos Monday.  In a<BR>statement at a press conference announcing activities in<BR>Nigeria to mark the golden jubilee of the world body, the<BR>minister urged an enlarged UN Security Council to include the<BR>populous West African country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ofonagoro, represented by the director-general in his<BR>ministry, Patrick Eta, said 'to have only five permanent<BR>members in a council that determines the direction of global<BR>peace and security, is undemocratic in the extreme.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said 'Nigeria's size, pivotal role in African affairs,<BR>and past services to the world body suggest that in the<BR>expected reconstitution of the security council, Nigeria has<BR>a strong case...' According to Ofonagoro, other credentials<BR>for Nigeria's bid for a permanent seat on the council include<BR>active participation in UN activities and 'significant<BR>contributions to the attainment of world peace and<BR>development.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian minister said the present composition of the<BR>security council 'no longer reflects current realities and is<BR>viewed as unjust and unreasonable by the vast majority of UN<BR>member nations.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, he said, although Asia, Africa and South<BR>America constituted more than 85 per cent of the members of<BR>the UN, these regions, with the exception of China, are not<BR>represented at the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two-day programme of events, from September 21-22,<BR>includes the launching of special commemorative stamps and a<BR>symposium under the theme 'uniting people for the better<BR>world: the challenge of the UN in the 21st century' and<BR>'Nigeria and the UN peace-keeping operations.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - The Zambian government has described as<BR>'childish' threats by the opposition to boycott the 1996<BR>general elections over a voters registration contract<BR>allegedly given to an Israeli firm, and denied that it had<BR>given any such contract to anybody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Information Minister Amusaa Mwanamwambwa said in Lusaka<BR>Sunday that calls by the opposition for the government to<BR>withdraw the alleged contract and their threats to boycott<BR>the elections, were mere 'scapegoat to avoid defeat.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanamwambwa who is also government chief spokesman, told<BR>local reporters in the capital that government was no aware<BR>of any firm having been awarded the contract which he said is<BR>still being processed by the national tender board.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'How can they start talking about t boycotting the<BR>elections when facts about this issue have not been made<BR>public by anybody,' said Mwanamwambwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's main opposition United National Independence<BR>Party (UNIP) of former President Kenneth Kaunda on Sunday,<BR>said it would join the boycott of the elections if the<BR>company, 'Nikuv Computers Israel,' said to have been given<BR>the job, is allowed to register the voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'If the registration of voters is going to be carried out<BR>by a private company so that the ruling Movement for<BR>Multiparty democracy (MMD) has a majority of voters on the<BR>register, then UNIP would boycott the elections,' said<BR>Sebastian Zulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zulu who is himself a lawyer had earlier this years ought<BR>a court injunction to restrain government from engaging a<BR>private firm to register voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He lost the application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third largest opposition National Party (NP) and the<BR>newly formed Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC), led by former<BR>Junior Minister Dean Mung'omba have also threatened to<BR>boycott the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party accused government of 'fraudulently' awarding<BR>the 18-million-dollar contract to the Israelis to help the<BR>ruling party to rig the elections and for personal financial<BR>gain by some government leaders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Desai said that an appeal for the funds has already been<BR>made to the donor community, whom he said were responding<BR>well.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister said that government was working out a scheme<BR>for private dealers to bring in the maize which, he said,<BR>will be more expensive than the local stocks because of the<BR>import expenses and the varying prices from the various<BR>sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government is itself holding some 36,000 tonnes of the<BR>grain to be brought on to the market in case of dire need,<BR>according to Desai.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GENEVA - President Robert Mugabe on Sunday said African<BR>political leaders still had a lot to do to secure permanent<BR>peace in those countries still gripped by internal strife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing African diplomats and Zimbabweans who came to<BR>see him at the Zimbabwean chancery of the United Nations in<BR>Geneva, Mugabe said the advent of democracy in South Africa<BR>had resolved a major problem for the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ' I was impressed by the team from South said, referring<BR>to the All-Africa Games Taking place in Zimbabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'It was a mixture of black and white as if apartheid never<BR>existed. You begin to wonder why all this trouble was created<BR>in the first place.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe, who is in Geneva for the inaugural meeting of the<BR>South Centre on Monday, said he was encouraged by the<BR>consolidation of the peace process in Angola as well as the<BR>end of the civil war in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, flash points remained in countries such as<BR>Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia and Liberia. 'A lot remains to be<BR>done by the political leadership in these countries to secure<BR>permanent peace,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe briefed the diplomats on the on-going All-Africa<BR>Games but said it was unfortunate he had to leave in the<BR>middle of the games for the South Centre meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The Games demonstrate what we are capable of doing and<BR>what we are not capable of doing,' he said, adding that the<BR>games would help in preparations for the Summer Olympics in<BR>Atlanta, US, next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the South Centre, Mugabe said it had now reached a<BR>stage where, through collection of data and research, it can<BR>chart a path for interaction and development for third world<BR>countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, President Mugabe met the chairman of the South<BR>Centre, former Tanzanian President, Julius Nyerere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nyerere said in an interview later, that 43 countries had<BR>signed the agreement authorising the setting up of the<BR>centre. The constitution required a minimum of ten countries<BR>to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked why an organisation dealing with problems of the<BR>South had its headquarters in the North, Nyerere said Geneva<BR>was ideal for the organisation because it was neutral and<BR>host to several international organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, Switzerland had in the past assisted the South<BR>Commission, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Mugabe arrived in Geneva earlier than scheduled<BR>taking organisers and the Swiss government by surprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, only ambassador Tichaona Jokonya and his<BR>staff were on hand to receive him, themselves having received<BR>the signal only minutes earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe was scheduled to fly via London, but wen straight<BR>to Geneva after the British denied landing rights to the<BR>Boeing 707 the president is flying because it is not hushHowever, the matter seems to have been sorted out and<BR>kitted (modified to reduce noise).<BR>Mugabe will be able to fly back home through London later on<BR>Monday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABUJA - Nigeria's diplomatic missions are to be<BR>rationalised and restructured to cut cost and make them more<BR>effective and productive, Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, has<BR>said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The official News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) quoted him<BR>Sunday as saying, 'we (Nigeria) are now rationalising the<BR>embassies and looking at who and who are there and looking at<BR>the situation at headquarters.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria had more than 100 diplomatic missions, which were<BR>pruned in the late 1980's to the present size of around 80,<BR>largely for of economic reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ikimi did not indicate which missions would be affected in<BR>the latest exercise, but NAN quoted him as saying some of the<BR>missions might be closed down, some expanded or down-graded<BR>while some new ones might be created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the rationalization was being carried out along<BR>with posting of junior and middle level staff to missions and<BR>appointment of new Ambassadors and High Commissioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian minister also spoke of the need to strike s<BR>'good balance' in the appointment of career ambassadors and<BR>political posting so that the right calibre of staff were<BR>sent to man the country's missions.<BR> 'We want to avoid a situation where we might have the<BR>problem of sending a political ambassador to a mission which<BR>is infested with people who cannot give him the necessary<BR>support,' Ikimi added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS - It is not commonplace to see academics abandon the<BR>lure of the 'Ivory Tower' for the risky political terrain<BR>considered the preserve of politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A group of intellectuals from northern Nigeria apparently<BR>taking a cue from their counterparts in the South have joined<BR>in the race by Nigerian academics to respond to the pressing<BR>needs of society.<BR> Under the auspices of the Swiss Embassy in Lagos in<BR>collaboration with the Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA)<BR>and a Swiss-based cultural exchange programme, a week-long<BR>short story and poetry workshop was recently held in<BR>Maidurugi, capital of the northern state of Borno.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From 21 participants emerged more than one hundred poems<BR>and short stories from which Nigerian author Zaynab Alkali<BR>and Swiss writer and journalist Al Imfeld, co-ordinators of<BR>the workshop, chose the top 30 that formed the basis of a new<BR>literary adventure christened 'Vultures In The Air: Voices<BR>From Northern Nigeria.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 150-page anthology deals with wide-ranging issues<BR>touching on romance, hatred, anger, crime, governance and<BR>misgovernment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The poems and short stories include 'Student<BR>Demonstrations,' 'A Country Without Home,' 'The Rapist,<BR>''Code Of Silence,' 'Vultures,' from which the book derives<BR>its name, and 'We Shall Rise With The Sun.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was even one on 'Children of Bosnia,' by Halima<BR>Adamu, which can easily be adapted to the sorry situation in<BR>the two central African states of Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six of the Nigerian authors later came together in Lagos<BR>at a well-attended ceremony under another joint project with<BR>the German Geothe Institut and the British Council, for<BR>theatrical demonstration of their works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the writers, Micky Ibitomihi, who described himself<BR>as a 'poultry farmer,' was particularly impressive in his<BR>rendition of the 'Prophet Divines,' 'The Road,' and 'We Have<BR>Not Changed,' which argues that despite many tribulations and<BR>depression, the African appears not to have changed much, 'we<BR>are what we are.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'A Country Without Home,' by lecturer Musa Idris<BR>Okpanachi, talks about the ordeal of African children,<BR>'scattered in the four winds in locust multitudes. ''like an<BR>ant street stampeded on by elephants, they (the children)<BR>flee from home ravaged by the hunters...,' reads part of the<BR>poem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obi Iwuanyanwu in the 'Scream of Death,' talks about the<BR>ultimate justice that awaits a murderer. It however, leaves<BR>unanswered the question of whether crime could ever be<BR>justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adamu Usman in 'Those In Authority,' captures the sharp<BR>contrast of misery in the midst of affluence, noting that<BR>'the semen (in authority) parade at endless funerals of the<BR>weary masses in their galleries and artful shows.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For his part, another lecturer Idris Amali, in 'Don't You<BR>See,' reflects the lot of many an African in the 'Naked<BR>Raping of Hopes,' the lingering civil strife, and problems<BR>plaguing the health and the education sectors, as well as the<BR>rising crime wave amid institutionised corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for some curious coincidence, a recurring theme in<BR>most of the poems rendered by the six authors at the Lagos<BR>exhibition was on military government, apparently a backdrop<BR>from the long military intervention in Nigerian politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANA President Odia Ofeimun defended the choice of topics,<BR>saying the authors tried to reflect the mood of society,<BR>while one of the authors, Amali argued that he and his<BR>colleagues have no apology for addressing the military, which<BR>he described as the major 'stumbling block' to progress in<BR>Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But like a number of speakers in the audience noted, the<BR>ephitet of 'a general without an army' has assumed a national<BR>past-time in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The citizenry certainly deserve something refreshing,<BR>especially from the intellectuals and their work, 'Nigerians<BR>want to relax, go to the beach and talk about peace,' one<BR>commentator added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By and large, 'Vultures In The Air: Voices From Northern<BR>Nigeria,' may well represent a bold attempt at popularising<BR>poetry and short stories as potential tools to fight societal<BR>malaise. But it remains to be seen how far the intellectuals<BR>can go with their poetic message.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BULAWAYO - The Zimbabwe government has granted 83<BR>exclusive prospecting orders (EPO) for various minerals to<BR>local and foreign mining companies since the start of this<BR>year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to figures released by the Chamber of Mines of<BR>Zimbabwe on Wednesday, diamond was the most sought-after<BR>mineral accounting for 53 exploration licences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second most popular mineral was gold with 15 EPOS .The<BR>rest were issued for antimony, copper, cobalt, nickel,<BR>platinum, lead and zinc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, a total of 46 EPOS for various minerals with at<BR>least 36 for diamonds were issued to several companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An official of the mining body said foreign companies were<BR>willing to enter into joint ventures and invest huge amounts<BR>of money in exploration lasting up to three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He attributed increased investor interest to improved<BR>world commodity prices, a good investment climate and an<BR>aeromagnetic survey by the Canadian International Development<BR>Agency three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwe Investment Centre, which promotes foreign<BR>investment in the country, said mining, tourism and<BR>agriculture were major areas which had drawn enormous foreign<BR>interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - The Zambian government has provided jobs for many<BR>qualified Rwandan refugees who fled the civil strife in their<BR>country, Commissioner for Refugees Lameck Mwaba told PANA in<BR>Lusaka Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwaba said that there were currently an estimated 2,000<BR>Rwandan refugees in Zambia, including some highly qualified<BR>professionals like engineers and doctors who have been<BR>employed by the Zambian government, mostly in the capital,<BR>Lusaka.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwaba also confirmed that the government plans to set up a<BR>camp in Mporokoso, northern Zambia, for Rwandan refugees<BR>whom, he said, were entering the country at the rate of at<BR>least seven persons everyday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that government was finding it increasingly<BR>expensive to transport the refugees from their entry point at<BR>Nakonde to Maheba refugee camp in the north-west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government has already done the ground-work and solicited<BR>or the funds to set up the proposed camp, Mwaba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, an average 100 Angolans come to Zambia every<BR>month in search of food which is in short supply in southern<BR>Angola, according to Mwaba.<BR> They are currently being resettled at refugee camps as<BR>'economic immigrants', he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, there has been appreciable reduction in the<BR>number of Angolans fleeing to Zambia since last November's<BR>ceasefire in that country's civil war following the signing<BR>of a peace agreement between the government and former rebels<BR>of the Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE - Southern African Development Community (SADC)<BR>member states, keen to push forward regional economic<BR>integration in the mining sector, have agreed to standardise<BR>geological maps and carry out joint research of geological<BR>terrains across their borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A SADC workshop on regional integration in the mining<BR>sector held in Pretoria, South Africa from September 11 to 15<BR>agreed that measures should be put in place to enable any<BR>country within the community to access information on each<BR>other's geological maps.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to recommendations of the workshop released on<BR>Wednesday, effective sharing of information would involve: borders; - adoption of a singular regional classification of<BR>geological correlation of adjacent maps across common<BR>rocks; - production of regional remote sensing products and<BR>crystal studies and, - production of common colour codes for<BR>different names of the same type of rocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The workshop, attended by mining experts from the private<BR>and public sector, also recommended that the SADC region<BR>should adopt a common approach in the application of<BR>engineering and environmental geology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This could be achieved by the setting up of standardised<BR>practices including the legal framework and promoting<BR>consultations during the planning and design of major<BR>engineering works, particularly in cases which may have cross<BR>border effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was also need to assess the safety of proposed major<BR>construction activities such as embarkments, dams, roads,<BR>tunnels and waste disposal sites and improve research and<BR>development to achieve cooperation in this field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regarding mining and marketing, the workshop recommended<BR>that governments should improve the organisation and<BR>dissemination of information to the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marketing of minerals had also to be largely left to the<BR>private sector.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE - The Commander of the United Nations peacekeeping<BR>operations in Angola, Maj-Gen.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sibanda told journalists in Harare that there was<BR>political commitment from both warring factions in Angola,<BR>UNITA and the government, which he said was an indication<BR>that prospects of peace were brightening. He leaves Zimbabwe<BR>for Angola on Wednesday afternoon for his one-year tour of<BR>duty to take over from outgoing Chris Garuba of Nigeria as<BR>commander of 7,000 soldiers on the Angolan mission from<BR>October 1.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last November UNITA and the Angolan government signed a<BR>peace agreement in Lusaka, Zambia, ending nearly 20 years of<BR>civil war, which have since been breached by both parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The mission that I am undertaking is a very difficult<BR>task which requires a lot of support from everyone. I am glad<BR>to mention that the peace accord signed in Lusaka came about<BR>as a result of both parties agreeing on the way forward.<BR>'There is political will to bring peace to Angola. The<BR>mission is not only difficult, it is also a challenge, but<BR>because there is political will from both parties, the<BR>mission will succeed', Sibanda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Troops participating in the mission include a Zimbabwean<BR>battalion of 800 soldiers, along with similar units from<BR>India, Uruguay, Romania and Brazil. Zambia is expected to<BR>send its troops by the end of this month. The UN peacekeeping<BR>troops will be engaged in verifying, monitoring, reporting<BR>and investigating any incidents linked with the Lusaka peace<BR>agreement. On the violation of the Lusaka agreement, Sibanda<BR>said it was expected that there would be violations<BR>considering that the country had been at war for nearly 20<BR>years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A stream of patients and other attendants carrying<BR>mattresses, basins, and saucepans continue to flow out of the<BR>hospital while most wards were virtually empty, expect for a<BR>few frail patients who lay on their beds without attention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - Zambia's National Tender Board says it has<BR>awarded Nikuv Computers of Israel an 18-million-dollar<BR>contract to register voters for this year's local government<BR>polls, and the 1996 Presidential and parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tender Board Director Teddy Mulonga who made the<BR>announcement in Lusaka on Wednesday said the Israeli firm had<BR>met all tender requirements.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten other local and foreign<BR>companies submitted tenders for the job, he added.  Mulonga's<BR>confirmation of the contract comes in the wake of threats of<BR>mass boycott of the elections by opposition parties which<BR>claim that government had 'fraudulently' awarded the contract<BR>to the Israeli company to assist the ruling party rig the<BR>elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main opposition United National Independence<BR>Party(UNIP) of former president Kenneth Kaunda and the<BR>National Party among others, have demanded that the contract<BR>be withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said awarding the contract to a foreign company<BR>breached Zambia's electoral laws which recognise the National<BR>Electoral Commission as the only body allowed to deal with<BR>electoral matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP had earlier this year sought a court injunction to<BR>prevent the government from engaging a private firm for the<BR>job. But the application failed on procedural grounds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In eight parliamentary bye-elections Tuesday, Unip<BR>captured Mbala and Mpulungu in the north and Mkushi north in<BR>central Zambia, all previously held by the ruling party led<BR>by President Frederick Chiluba.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> T he ruling party however made inroads in the east by<BR>scooping the Chama south parliamentary seat that had been<BR>held by Unip. It also retained the Chama north seat. Both are<BR>in eastern Zambia, a Unip stronghold.  The MMD retained the<BR>Chilanga and Mandevu seats in Lusaka and was Thursday<BR>reportedly leading Namwala, southern Zambia whose result has<BR>not been officially announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chama south is the first seat to go to the ruling party in<BR>eastern Zambia since the 1991 multiparty general elections<BR>when Unip scooped all the seats in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political observers attributed the government's loss in<BR>the otherwise 'safe' Mpulungu, Mbala and Mkushi north rural<BR>constituencies to a protest vote by peasant farmers unhappy<BR>about alleged poor management of agriculture by the MMD<BR>government.<BR> Kaunda, who had himself been actively involved in the<BR>election campaigns, is targetting farmers and retrenchees in<BR>his bid to return to power in Zambia's 1996 presidential and<BR>general elections. Kaunda has said he will challenge Chiluba<BR>for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unip will now have 21 seats in the house. Three other by<BR>elections are to be held in October.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAPUTO - Delegations headed by th Mozambican defence<BR>minister Aguiar Mazula and his Zimbabwean counterpart Moven<BR>Mahachi met in Maputo on Wednesday to discuss revising the<BR>1988 military cooperation agreement between the two<BR>countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mazula after the meeting disclosed that 600 members o of<BR>the Mozambican Defence Force (FADM) would be trained as<BR>instructors at the Nyanga Camp in eastern Zimbabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The<BR>training will be undertaken by Zimbabwean and British<BR>officers and will be financed by Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On returning to Mozambique, the instructors will train<BR>sargeants at the Boane and Manhica Barracks, both in Maputo<BR>province. Mazula said that the FADM was short of sergeants.<BR>It was also at Nyanga that the 540 instructors (half from the<BR>old government army and half from the former rebel movement<BR>Renamo) involved in forming the FADM's infantry battalions<BR>last year, were trained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was believed the presence of a Zimbabwean military<BR>delegation in Maputo could also have to do with measures to<BR>deal with the armed Zimbabwean dissidents, known as<BR>'Chimwenjes', believed to be operating from Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chimwenjes are believed to have bases in the central<BR>Mozambican province of Manica from which they are said to be<BR>preparing incursions into Zimbabwe. But when Mozambican<BR>television raised the issue with him, Mahachi said he knew<BR>nothing about the Chimwenjes. He clearly did not think they<BR>posed any serious threat to Zimbabwe, and appeared skeptical<BR>as to their very existence. 'We have never faced any attack<BR>from Mozambique,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chimwenjes have proved highly elusive, and the reports<BR>filtering out of Manica have been contradictory --speaking of<BR>a Zimbabwean movement, but at the same time claiming that it<BR>consists mostly of Mozambicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Manica reports say the Chimwenjes owe allegiance to<BR>some Zimbabwean opposition politicians.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a ceremony to mark the end of the third joint<BR>training programme of Zimbabwean and United States soldiers<BR>at Inkomo barracks outside Harare on Thursday, Carigher said<BR>the programme had since it started in 1993 been very<BR>successful.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Construction of some games venues were done between end of<BR>last year and beginning of this year while some of the final<BR>touches were not done until the week of the commencement of<BR>the Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eleya said the sporting disciplines in the next games<BR>would not necessarily be reduced, but would depend on what<BR>the host country was capable of managing.  'Host countries<BR>should start preparing the games more than three years before<BR>so that they are ready for the event, 'he said.  He said six<BR>zones affiliated to the SCSA, were at the Stodart Hall to<BR>watch the netball match between Malawi and Zimbabwe which the<BR>latter won 55-38.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior sports officials said they were impressed by the<BR>high standard of netball displayed by the two teams and hoped<BR>the sport would be accepted as a medal sport by other African<BR>countries.  Five countries -- Botswana, Namibia, Malawi,<BR>South Africa and Zimbabwe -- sent teams to the competitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The zone Secretary-generals will work to promote netball<BR>in their areas,' Eleya said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNITED NATIONS - Fifteen United Nations member countries,<BR>most of them from Africa, have been barred from voting in the<BR>current 50th session of the UN General Assembly because of<BR>their failure to pay their annual contributions. A letter<BR>from the UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to the<BR>president of the assembly said the countries were barred<BR>under the terms of Article 19 of the UN charter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Article 19 states: 'A member of the UN which is in arrears<BR>in the payment of its financial contributions to the<BR>organization shall have no vote in the General Assembly if<BR>the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the<BR>contributions due from it for the preceding two full years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The General Assembly may, nevertheless, permit such a<BR>member to vote if it is satisfied that the failure to pay is<BR>due to conditions beyond the control of the member.' The<BR>Secretary General's letter also contained the minimum<BR>payments that must be made by the banned countries before<BR>they can be allowed to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The assembly exempted South Africa, whose total<BR>outstanding contributions to the UN stood at about USD 61<BR>million at the end of July. It said the country had been<BR>exempted from the ban because the arrears accrued were 'due<BR>to conditions beyond its control'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The countries that were penalised, and their minimum<BR>payments, in US dollars are: Burundi (47,300), Central<BR>African Republic (98,900), Chad (195,800), Comoros (115,400),<BR>Dominican Republic (568,000), Gambia (114,600), Guatemala<BR>(44,628), Iraq (615,900), Liberia (302,200), Mali (68,300),<BR>Niger (94,500), Sao Tome and Principe (115,300), Sierra Leone<BR>(114,423), Somalia (267,600) and Yugoslavia (6,945,400).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE - The Sixth All-Africa Games in Zimbabwe has<BR>exposed deep-rooted racial divisions bedevilling sport in<BR>Africa, particularly in southern part of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, where the<BR>indigenous majority population are still suppressed<BR>economically by a European settler minority, have been<BR>fielding teams of athletes mostly comprising Whites in such<BR>sports as swimming, hockey, tennis, gymnastics, cycling and<BR>shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The assistant head of the South African delegation to the<BR>games, Mvuzo Mbebe, says the complexion of largely white<BR>teams will have to change to reflect the country's rainbow<BR>population.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'It is our intention that by the time we reach the next<BR>Commonwealth Games (in 1998) the composition of the team<BR>should be drastically changed,' he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa has about 25 million blacks and five million<BR>whites. There are also Indians and people of mixed race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new African National Congress-led government o<BR>national unity, he says, has started a programme to build<BR>basic sporting facilities in the poor black townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sporting boards of what were viewed as largely elitist<BR>games such as rugby and cricket have started building<BR>facilities in the townships to introduce these disciplines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The racial composition of Namibia's teams are similar to<BR>South Africa's. The men's hockey team at the games comprises<BR>white players and one of mixed race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Team Manager Neil Dupless is says many black<BR>Namibians are being trained in the sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'In seven years time we will see changes in Namibian<BR>hockey. By that time a lot of youths would be playing the<BR>sport,' he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's men's hockey team is predominantly white<BR>with only one coloured. So is its men's and women's swimming<BR>teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Racial division among spectators is also evident at hockey<BR>tournaments. When the South African, Namibian and Zimbabwean<BR>teams were playing huge crowds of spectators, mostly whites,<BR>flocked to the Harare hockey stadium for these tournaments.<BR>Few bothered when it was teams from other countries with<BR>black players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In shooting, Angola brought six contestants, two of them<BR>of mixed race. Kenya brought four people in its shooting<BR>squad --one of Indian origin, the rest whites. Namibia<BR>brought 12 all of them whites. South Africa had eight<BR>contestants, all whites. The same was true for Zimbabwe's 18The president of the Zimbabwe Shooting Federation, James<BR>member squad. However, all 10 from Nigerian were blacks.<BR>Cantlay, the high costs of firearms, pellets and targets was<BR>the reason for the lack of black participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But efforts are being made to encourage Zimbabweans of all<BR>races to participate, the chairman of the Zimbabwe Pistol and<BR>Smallbore Association, Robert Green, says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already negotiations were underway with government to have<BR>members of the police, the army and the air force<BR>participate. They would reduce their costs by using<BR>government issued firearms and ammunition for training and<BR>competitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president of the African Shooting Confederation,<BR>Mounir Sabet of Egypt, says other African countries are now<BR>encouraging the participation of their military and police in<BR>competitive shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The secretary-general of Athletics South Africa, Banele<BR>Sindani, says while there had been no development of sports<BR>facilities and athletics in black townships, the new<BR>government of national unity is now redressing the imbalances<BR>by providing facilities. This will be spread over 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, he says, this would have to be weighed against other<BR>urgent problems like providing social services and houses for<BR>blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'A lot has to be done, but it must be remembered that we<BR>cannot develop sport in isolation, we have to develop other<BR>areas too,' Sindani says.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Panafrican News Agency<BR>September 22, 1995<BR>by Paul Ejime, PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS - The 52nd birthday of Nigeria's military ruler Gen.<BR>Sani Abacha passed off Wednesday without elaborate<BR>celebration, but he used the anniversary to underscore the<BR>burden of leadership in the populous West African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha's Council of Ministers gave him a life-size card<BR>and sang the traditional 'happy birthday' to mark the<BR>occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was one of the few occasions at which the bespectacled<BR>infantry general beamed in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha was witty about the occasion, making it clear that<BR>age depends on how an individual feels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'People can be 70 years and feel maybe, they are only<BR>40... but for me, I am feeling as if I am already, maybe 80,<BR>'said the man at the helm of the unenviable Nigerian ship of<BR>state for almost two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another word, Abacha was telling those who aspire to<BR>leadership of the West African country, it is not a piece of<BR>cake and can make one age faster than normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a man not given to much public speech, even as head of<BR>state, Abacha should be taken seriously on a subject on which<BR>he can claim a measure of authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he took power on 17 November 1993 in the heat of<BR>political crisis unleashed by the cancellation of Nigeria's<BR>June 1993 presidential election by the previous regime of<BR>Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, Abacha must have hit many Nigerians<BR>by storm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before then, critics gave him low marks as a potential<BR>ruler, but those close to him in the army knew Abacha as a<BR>'tough soldier'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts say Abacha's strength lay in his knowledge of the<BR>workings of the Nigerian army from the grassroots to the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Babangida 'stepped aside' on 26 August 1993, he left<BR>the Ernest Shonekan-led interim government in a chaotic<BR>political climate with Abacha as Defence Minister and the<BR>second ranking member of the lame-duck administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The turmoil under Shonekan virtually left the country<BR>rudderless with calls from some quarters for a military takeWhether by coincidence or by design, Abacha did not miss<BR>over.<BR>the opportunity to take control of a sinking ship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has gone ahead to demonstrate his toughness in the<BR>subtle but decisive manner he has dealt with the opposition,<BR>especially the striking oil workers' unions, whose executives<BR>were sacked and replaced with government administrators<BR>ending a strike which virtually paralysed the country in July<BR>and August 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With silence as his greatest weapon, Abacha has remained<BR>an enigma, an unpredictable man who should not be<BR>underestimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has shown this in more ways than one. Not least in the<BR>fact that Nigerian heavyweights such as former Head of State<BR>Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo and his former deputy, Maj.  Gen.<BR>Shehu Musa Yar'dua or even millionaire-politician Moshood<BR>Abiola are today in detention. Many Nigerians would have<BR>considered this unthinkable a few years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola, who claimed victory in the annulled 1993<BR>presidential election, is facing trial for treason after he<BR>proclaimed himself President of Nigeria in June 1994 in<BR>defiance of Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obasanjo and Yar'adua on the other hand, are among a group<BR>of 40 people convicted in July by a military tribunal for<BR>involvement in an alleged plot to topple Abacha in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to calls from within and outside Nigeria for<BR>the release of Abiola, Abacha said the trial would run its<BR>course, while the fate of Obasanjo and other coup suspects<BR>lies with the reconstituted policy-making Provisional Ruling<BR>Council led by him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are already enough problems to make a 52-year-old<BR>man age faster. Abacha also has to worry about Nigeria's<BR>economic difficulties and the unresolved issue of returning<BR>the west African country to democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerians may get an idea of where their ship is heading<BR>on 1 October, the country's 35th independence anniversary,<BR>and the day Abacha has chosen to disclose his political<BR>programme.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE - lurking hostility between South African and<BR>Algerian athletes and officials reached breaking point on<BR>Thursday afternoon when the two parties exchanged bitter<BR>words at the Belvedere Teachers' College, venue of the Sixth<BR>All-Africa Games gymnastics championships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tense atmosphere during the men and women's artistic<BR>individual apparatus, pommel horse competition, cracked after<BR>Algerian officials disputed a score awarded to their gymnast<BR>and a South African.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The game was stopped for a while as the north Africans<BR>flocked the judges and started pointing out errors made by<BR>eventual gold medalist Zoltan Erdy with 9.0 points, arguing<BR>that the panel comprising, a Chinese, German, Algerian,<BR>Egyptian and two South Africans had favoured Erdy giving him<BR>too high marks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview later, they said Erdy sat on the horse,<BR>flexed his knee and on a number of occasions hit the horse,<BR>all faults for which he should have been heavily penalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their gymnast, Mohamed Othmani who came second with 8.950<BR>points, they said, had been cheated and awarded marks too low<BR>for his performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African officials did not take kindly to outbursts<BR>about their gymnast and protested loudly resulting in a din<BR>that attracted the police who moved in swiftly and watched<BR>the brawl without intervening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Competition Director, South Africa-based Johannes Cloete<BR>quelled the noise without giving an opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Judge, Englishman Tom Smith said he stood by the<BR>scores awarded by the judges, saying there was no need to<BR>take the issue further to the committee of appeal because the<BR>contested difference was small - a fraction of a point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Algerian Abdelkader Mecellem who was in sixth place<BR>boycotted the medals presentation ceremony and his officials<BR>said the action was in protest of the earlier scuffle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As medalists and finalists were called out to take the<BR>irrespective places on the podium, Algerians hugged fellow<BR>countrymen or neighbours Egypt while the most of a<BR>congratulatory gesture to a South African was a handshake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not to be outdone, one South African finalist kept his<BR>hands tightly clasped before him whenever a north African<BR>gymnast was close enough to shake hands, but held out hands<BR>warmly for compatriots or anyone from southern Africa like<BR>Zimbabwe and Swaziland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE - Zimbabwe's under-23 soccer team undertakes a do<BR>or die mission when it confronts Egypt Saturday in the finals<BR>of the Sixth All-Africa Games: The winner grabs the coveted<BR>gold medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will not be the first clash between Zimbabwe and Egypt<BR>in the continent's sporting showcase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the 1991 games in Cairo, Zimbabwe's now senior<BR>national team players Kennedy Nagoli and Agent Sawu<BR>spearheaded a 2-1 victory over the Egyptians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That defeat prompted some racist remarks by sections o the<BR>Egyptian media which described Zimbabweans as slaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the preliminaries of the current games the Egyptians,<BR>who pride themselves as Africa's soccer giants, were felled<BR>2-1 by a more polished Zimbabweans out to prove that their<BR>feat in Cairo was no fluke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Saturday's encounter Zimbabwe will want to prove that<BR>the 'master' can, again, be beaten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe has every reason to win. There will be a partisan<BR>crowd expected at the 60,000-seat national sports stadium.<BR>Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has promised the players<BR>generous incentives -- if they win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe's young warriors are also motivated by the desire<BR>to emulate the senior team which booted the Egyptians from he<BR>1994 World Cup qualifiers in December 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwe squad boasts the services of the exciting<BR>Alois Bunjira and the shaven-headed Muteji twins, Cain and<BR>Able, to deliver the goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a reign of terror, the trio ran rings around Guinea's<BR>defence Thursday in a 2-0 triumph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe's dreadlocked Methembe Ndlovu is also expected to<BR>dictate the pace in midfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egypt, without their influential play-maker Hazem Emams<BR>should find it difficult to make inroads into the tight<BR>Zimbabwe defence marshalled by Captain Vusi Laher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But whether or not Zimbabwe lives up to expectations can<BR>only be decided on the final whistle at 5.30 p.m. (1500 gmt).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE - Athletes competing in the sixth All Africa Games<BR>in Harare have baffled games village authorities at the<BR>University of Zimbabwe with their huge appetites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the games kicked off on September 13, the more than<BR>3,400 athletes from 46 competing countries are consuming each<BR>day more than twice the normal food intake of the university<BR>students who are now off the campus on holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fredrick Kasese, the games village manager, said Friday<BR>that the caterers had had to increase food provisions to<BR>satisfy the demands of the sportsmen and women they are<BR>hosting for the 10-day games.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The problem we had was that sportsmen are so different<BR>from the students we are used to. They are eating more than<BR>twice what our students consume normally,' said Kasese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'These athletes, they have huge appetites, very huge<BR>appetites but we have managed to cater for every taste to the<BR>best of our ability.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So huge is the appetite of the athletes that each day they<BR>are consuming 2,400 kilogrammes of meat and have so far gone<BR>through more than 12 tonnes of rice, 10 tonnes of mealie-meal<BR>and Zimdollars 200 000 (USD 27,000) worth of fruits and<BR>vegetables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least 6,000 litres of cooking oil or 30 drums have been<BR>used in preparing food for the athletes who had to pay USD 30<BR>per day for meals, accommodation, transport and laundry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For breakfast, said Kasese, the athletes have so far eaten<BR>7,500 dozens of eggs and 2,200 dozens of bread, washing this<BR>down with unlimited quantities of soft drinks provided free<BR>by the official beverage supplier to the games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kasese said that apart from a few isolated incidents his<BR>guests have been 'very good, very friendly and sociable'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The one blemish was when an athlete from a country he<BR>would not name brought in a big bag and helped himself to<BR>forks and plates bearing the university logo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'We searched the bag and found these items, so we had a<BR>chat with him. He apologised. He assumed the items were<BR>souvenirs because of the university logo,' said Kasese.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS - A cross-section of Nigerian politicians met here<BR>Monday on the future of the restive populous west African<BR>country, six days to 1 October, when military ruler Gen. Sani<BR>Abacha is expected to unfold his political agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Octogenarian politician Michael Ajasin, a key member of<BR>the opposition National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), and<BR>the co-ordinator of the meeting said he called the forum<BR>tagged 'Pan-Nigeria Political Summit,' to narrow differences<BR>between the 'conservative and progressive' political class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting, from which a communique is being expected,<BR>was also called according to Ajasin, a former civilian state<BR>governor, to create a 'formidable front for the survival' of<BR>Nigeria's fourth republic.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a number of key politicians including former Lagos<BR>state civilian governor and an ex-works minister in the<BR>Abacha regime, Lateef Jakande and his former agriculture<BR>counterpart Adamu Ciroma shunned the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ajasin told the gathering there would be no enduring<BR>democracy and progress in Nigeria if politicians failed to<BR>work as 'a united front.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former governor urged his colleagues to bury their<BR>differences and 'recognise our common brotherhood and<BR>citizenship and make that the basis of interaction and<BR>political relationship.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the military was able to repeatedly abort<BR>democratic experiments in the country because of the 'patent<BR>lack of unity among politicians.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The army has ruled Nigeria for 25 years of its 35 years<BR>independence from Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ajasin suggested that politicians of all persuasions 'must<BR>be prepared jointly to frustrate any future ascession to<BR>power by any means other than the ballot box,'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On how to resolve the lingering political crisis arising<BR>from the June 12, 1993 Presidential election annulled by the<BR>previous military regime, he said the political class should<BR>engage in over the political crisis, with detained<BR>millionaire-politician Moshood Abiola, the acclaimed winner<BR>of the annulled presidential poll playing a major role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ajasin also said the government should neither form<BR>political parties nor limit the number of political parties<BR>allowed to seek power under the new dispensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former governor, who has been in the forefront of<BR>NADECO's campaign for the exit of military, called on Abacha<BR>to release all political detainees, including Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also called for clemency for a group of 40 Nigerians<BR>including former Head of State, Olusegun Obasanjo and his<BR>former deputy, Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, convicted in July for<BR>involvement in an alleged plot to topple Abacha in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other key politicians at the meeting included another<BR>civilian governor, Solomon Lar, former information minister<BR>in the Abacha regime, Jerry Gana and Anthony Enahoro, another<BR>NADECO leader.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK - A team of African-American newspaper executives<BR>and writers has left the United States on a fact-finding<BR>mission to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leavell, President of the Black National Newspaper<BR>Publishers Association, said the team would also seethe<BR>release of political prisoners in the West African state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'We hope to bring back not only accurate news of what is<BR>happening there, but we are seeking to have those who are<BR>being held as prisoners released,' Leavell, who is also<BR>delegation leader, said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement from the NNPA said the African-American<BR>community in the United States was divided on how to respond<BR>to Nigeria's political crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, it said, was partly due to its inability to verify<BR>reports on the situation in the country, Africa's most<BR>populous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The Black Press has noted that, to date, all reports<BR>coming from and about Nigeria have come through the white<BR>press and we don't feel their reports provide accurate<BR>balance,' the NNPA said in explaining the mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leavell said the trip to Nigeria 'takes place at a time of<BR>historic opportunity to bring an objective, first hand look<BR>at the situation 'offering information that the dominant<BR>white(American) media has not made available to the public.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 40 alleged plotters have recently been detained<BR>following the Nigerian government's allegations of a recently<BR>failed coup attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moshood Abiola, the millionaire politician assumed to have<BR>won Nigeria's June 1993 presidential election, is also<BR>languishing in jail as he awaits trial for alleged treason<BR>for having declared himself the country's president last<BR>year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The arrests, including that of former head of state<BR>Olusegun Obasanjo, have stirred international calls for<BR>clemency from the United States President Bill Clinton, the<BR>Pope, President Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya and Robert Mugabe of<BR>Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Mandela recently sent South Africa's Deputy<BR>President Thabo Mbeki to personally deliver his country's<BR>appeals for democratization and freeing of alleged<BR>conspirators to the Nigerian leader Gen. Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protests against the arrests have led to weekly pickets at<BR>the Nigerian embassy in Washington. These have been organized<BR>by TransAfrica, a black organization that played a key role<BR>in the campaign for American sanctions against apartheid<BR>South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leavell's delegation was expected to arrive in Nigeria<BR>Tuesday and leave October 3.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaira said government should either call a referendum or a<BR>constituent assembly to discuss the draft so the final<BR>document would be legitimate. Failure to do so, he said, was<BR>'undemocratic and unacceptable'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Labour Party President Chibeza Mfuni said that since the<BR>parliament was controlled by Chiluba's party there would be<BR>no political diversity in the constitution if adopted by the<BR>158-member parliament.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS - Nigeria' military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha in a<BR>veiled response to mounting pleas on behalf of detained<BR>millionaire-politician, Moshood Abiola and Nigerians<BR>convicted for an alleged coup plot, has said the country's<BR>law will take its course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola is facing trial for alleged treasonable felony<BR>after proclaiming himself president of Nigeria in June 1994<BR>based on the military annulled 1993 presidential election, in<BR>which he claimed victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A group of 40 Nigerians, including former Head of State<BR>Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo and his former deputy, Maj. Gen. Shehu<BR>Musa Yar'adua, were on the other hand convicted for<BR>involvement in the alleged conspiracy to topple Abacha in<BR>March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appeals for Abiola's release and clemency for the coup<BR>suspects have been pouring from within and outside the<BR>country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing traditional rulers from Lagos in Abuja, Monday,<BR>Abacha said 'there must be respect for law and order in our<BR>nation. Nobody should think that he is above the law.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Abiola, he said 'there is no political detainee in<BR>Nigeria. Abiola committed treasonable felony. He swore<BR>himself as a Head of State and was even making preparation to<BR>form a parallel government.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the coup suspects, he said the government had taken<BR>time to investigate the involvement of all the suspects 'so<BR>that at the end of the day, justice would not only be done,<BR>it must be seen to have been done.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'It is time we started putting things right,' Abacha said<BR>adding: 'people will go and incite innocent officers into<BR>this sort of thing (coup plot) and stay behind so innocent<BR>people will be arrested, tried and killed while those behind<BR>them are free.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A reconstituted policy-making Provisional Ruling Council<BR>chaired by Abacha has yet to ratify the unspecified sentences<BR>passed on the coup suspects by a military tribunal in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha warned individuals or groups attempting to divide<BR>the country, they would be doing so at 'their own peril.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He reminded them that Nigerians fought a 30-month civil<BR>war to keep the country together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 21-member delegation of traditional rulers included<BR>the Oba (traditional ruler) Adeyinka Oyekan of Lagos,<BR>chairman of the state council of traditional rulers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their visit coincided with a 'Pan-Nigeria Summit' in Lagos<BR>Monday by a cross-section of Nigerian politicians, led by<BR>octogenarian politician, Michael Ajasin, a leader of the proThe politicians issued a communique late Monday in Lagos<BR>democracy National Democratic Coalition (nadeco).<BR>calling for 'an all-civilian government to midwife a credible<BR>transition to democracy,' in the west African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forum suggested that Abiola be involved in the process<BR>and negotiation between the military and the political class<BR>to resolve the country's lingering political crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha took power in November 1993 in the heat of the<BR>political turmoil unleashed by the annulled presidential<BR>election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has promised to unfold his political programme on<BR>October 1, based on the report of a National Constitutional<BR>Conference which submitted a draft constitution to him in<BR>July.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - South Africa will not join the Common<BR>Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), a senior<BR>foreign affairs department official has hinted.  The<BR>official, Eben Van Rensburg, who is also his country's<BR>Southern African Development Community (SADC) national<BR>contact point coordinator said South Africa has not as yet<BR>made a policy on Comesa membership.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Van Rensburg told a visiting group of journalists from<BR>SADC countries in Pretoria Tuesday night that it could have<BR>been a great blunder for his country to have joined Comesa<BR>after becoming a member of SADC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'If we did that we could have slammed the door in the face<BR>of SADC members,' Van Rensburg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked why South Africa had not pronounced its policy on<BR>Comesa, Van Rensburg said the issue was not an urgent one for<BR>his government has more urgent matters to deal with.  The<BR>effectiveness of Comesa, which groups some 22 eastern and<BR>southern African states, is likely to be undermined if South<BR>Africa, the most advanced economy in the region, does not<BR>become a member.  Out of SADC's 12 members only South Africa<BR>and Botswana are not members of Comesa. Botswana, which hosts<BR>the SADC secretariat, has made it clear that it will not join<BR>Comesa.  Botswana and the SADC secretariat claim that Comesa<BR>is too large to be effective.  Meanwhile, South Africa has<BR>suggested that the SADC secretariat be expanded to improve<BR>efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Van Rensburg said the current situation under which most<BR>of SADC's work is done by sector coordinators was not<BR>effective.  Sector coordinators are full-time civil servants<BR>who are preoccupied with their national duties, he said.  Van<BR>Rensburg added that most governments did not budget for<BR>sector coordination expenses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS - Nigerian Youth and Sports Minister Jim Nwobodo<BR>Tuesday refuted media reports that the country lost three<BR>medals from two of its athletes who allegedly tested positive<BR>at the just-ended Sixth All-African Games in Harare,<BR>Zimbabwe.<BR> Addressing a press conference on Nigeria's performance at<BR>the Pan-African games, Nwobodo, who led Nigeria's 500-strong<BR>contingent dismissed the press reports as untrue.<BR> He said what happened in one of the two cases was that 'we<BR>were informed that a Nigerian athlete had tested positive to<BR>banned drugs in the first test and a confirmatory test was to<BR>be carried out the next day.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he added, 'in the letter, the (tournament<BR>identification) number of the athlete did not correspond with<BR>that of the athlete named.'<BR> He said that the number 'did not belong to any Nigerian<BR>athlete.' Nwobodo said the Supreme Council for Sports in<BR>Africa, the only body empowered to make a final decision on<BR>drug use cases, 'has already said that it has not taken a<BR>decision on the matter. As such, Nigeria has not 'repeat not'<BR>been stripped of any medal at all.'<BR> In the case of the second Nigerian athlete alleged to have<BR>tested positive, the minister said: 'The circumstances are<BR>even more questionable than the first because the letter<BR>communicating the result of the test was written even before<BR>the competition in question took place.'<BR> Nwobodo said that the council was 'still considering these<BR>cases and we are confident that justice will be done.'<BR>Nigeria grossed a total of 106 medals, including 37 gold, 26<BR>silver and 43 bronze to place third behind frontrunners South<BR>Africa and second-placed Egypt in the four-yearly tournament.<BR> The West African country hauled most of its medals in<BR>athletics with a total 32 medals -- 15 gold, nine silver and<BR>eight bronze.<BR> It took part in 19 of the 21 events at Harare '95, winning<BR>medals in all but five.<BR> Nigeria, however disappointed fans in the soccer<BR>tournament. It entered the competition as a favourite but<BR>only managed a bronze, with host Zimbabwe as runners-up to<BR>tournament champions, Egypt.<BR> Nwobodo conceded that Nigeria ought to have done better in<BR>soccer.<BR> 'I am aware that our team was intimidated and unfairly<BR>treated by match officials, in spite of that, I still feel<BR>that we should have presented a better team,' he said.<BR> According to Nwobodo the 'gains and pains of major<BR>championships such as the All-Africa Games transcend the<BR>arithmetic of gold, silver and bronze. It goes deep into such<BR>areas as politics, diplomacy, public relations and sometimes,<BR>even outright deceit.'<BR> The Nigerian delegation of officials and mainly home-based<BR>athletes to Harare returned home late Monday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR - Locust have cut a swath thousands of kilometres<BR>wide across farmland and threaten to destroy thousands more<BR>in the Western Sahel, a area running from Senegal in the West<BR>to Niger in the East.  The acting technical director for the<BR>Organisation for Locust Control, Balla Niang, said Tuesday in<BR>Dakar that a large swarm of desert locust was sighted Monday<BR>south of the Mauritanian capital, Nouakchott.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The swarms are a serious threat on unharvested crops and<BR>other agricultural activities along the river such as tree<BR>nurseries, forestry and rice farms,' he said.  'The situation<BR>could worsen as the majority of small swarms will be winged<BR>within the next few days,' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Swarms formed in the south-west of Mauritania were<BR>reported in northern Senegal in mid-September destroyed<BR>27,000 hectares of crops.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Briefing the press in Lusaka Thursday, FODEP president<BR>Foston Sakala charged that the government had an inescapable<BR>moral obligation to listen to the people's aspirations to<BR>have a constitution which would be adopted by all the Zambian<BR>interest groups.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government last Monday released a white paper in which<BR>it rejected the idea of a constituent assembly adopting the<BR>constitution but recommended that this be done by parliament.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia's main opposition United National<BR>Independence Party (UNIP) maintained in Lusaka Thursday that<BR>it will field former president Kenneth Kaunda in the<BR>scheduled 1996 presidential election despite what it called<BR>'the virulent campaign' by the ruling party against Kaunda<BR>which said was intended to portray him as a foreigner and<BR>'devil'.  UNIP Secretary-General Sebastian Zulu, speaking at<BR>a press briefing Thursday, charged that the ruling Movement<BR>for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) of President Frederick Chiluba<BR>had orchestrated a shameless hate campaign against Kaunda.<BR>He said that the campaign has now climaxed in the ruling<BR>party's draft republican constitution seeking to bar Kaunda<BR>from contesting the presidency and vowed that his party would<BR>do everything for Kaunda to stand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'We shall use every legal means in our power and<BR>politically so that nothing stops Dr Kaunda from contesting<BR>the presidency next year,' said Zulu who is himself one of<BR>Zambia's most prominent constitutional lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has recommended in a white paper on the<BR>draft constitution that only second generation Zambians<BR>should be allowed to contest the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda has Malawian parents but is himself a Zambian by<BR>birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zulu said that it was illogical that the MMD could want to<BR>bar Kaunda from seeking to contest the presidency after 31<BR>years of independence whose achievement Kaunda had himself<BR>spearheaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Kaunda led Zambia for 27 years and everything you see in<BR>Zambia was brought by Kaunda, how can anyone turn around now<BR>and accuse him of being a foreigner?' said Zulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that the right to choose Zambia's president lay<BR>with Zambians themselves and accused the ruling party of<BR>attempting to usurp this right. He said the move could be a<BR>recipe for civil strife, chaos and social disorder in the<BR>country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda himself Wednesday reiterated that he would 'fight<BR>the bitter end' to have the citizenship clause relating to<BR>presidential elections deleted from the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'We are ready to fight...The people of Zambia have fought<BR>such tyranny before. The settlers (British) thought they<BR>could sit on our rights...They were more powerful but we<BR>fought them and won,' said Kaunda in Lusaka Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joseph Connor, the UN Under-Secretary-General for<BR>Administration and Management, said in an interview published<BR>by The New York Times Thursday that a World Bank loan was one<BR>of the many ideas being explored 'to lift from our shoulders<BR>the burden of debt.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said although the UN had borrowed small amounts of<BR>money in the past for specific development projects, there<BR>was no precedent for the loan being proposed.  Connor's<BR>statement on the World Bank loan confirmed the one by<BR>Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in another interview<BR>on Saturday, that he planned to meet the World Bank president<BR>James Wolfensohn this weekend to discuss the proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'This crisis cannot be solved unless we borrow money, 'the<BR>Secretary-General was quoted as saying.  Meanwhile, the U.S.,<BR>which owes 1.2 billion dollars of the 3.4 billion dollars<BR>owed to the UN in unpaid assessments, is expected to object<BR>to the move to borrow money from the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bank is technically a part of the UN system but<BR>operates with considerable independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The UN and the Secretary-General have no authority to<BR>borrow externally,' the newspaper quoted an American diplomat<BR>assaying. 'Borrowing from the World Bank is restricted to<BR>sovereign governments.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BULAWAYO - The fanfare of the just ended Sixth All-Africa<BR>Games in Zimbabwe was at times marred by racial tension<BR>between participants from the predominantly Arabized north<BR>and indigenous Black Africa, diluting the solidarity expected<BR>of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This animosity is not new though it has scarcely been<BR>acknowledged at official levels where diplomacy takes<BR>precedence. It has maintained an invisible presence that only<BR>erupts when the ego of either side is challenged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was evident during competitions involving sub-Sahara<BR>countries against those from North Africa. Racial slurs and<BR>even physical scuffles disrupted the flow of the games.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The schism extended to spectators with those from the<BR>North backed their counterparts and vice versa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'He is a terrorist,' shouted Nigeria's head of delegation,<BR>Musa Bogonyaro, at an off duty Tunisian referee who had<BR>assaulted him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Algeria/Guinea soccer match exploded into a full-scale<BR>battle during which Algerians hurled racial slurs like 'black<BR>monkeys' and accompanied these with the most obscene and<BR>humiliating signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a fit of rage, Guinean striker Fode Camara spat in the<BR>face of an Algerian player, earning himself a red card.<BR>Algeria's Tarek Ghoul and Holine Bouaicha were suspended for<BR>two matches and their team fined 1,500 U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The slurs reminded Zimbabweans of Egyptian newspaper<BR>reports during the 1991 Cairo games which said Zimbabwean<BR>teams and brought monkey meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the fight ensued, Zimbabwean spectators joined Guineans<BR>supporters shouting 'Fundamentalists, Fundamentalists' and<BR>'Guinea is Africa.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's vollyball coach Olatunde Fakuade said, 'because<BR>of some traces of white blood, the North Africans always<BR>think of us in terms of slaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'In general North Africans do not want to accept defeat<BR>and always think they are superior to Black Africans.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The assault on the Nigerian head of delegation, Musa<BR>Bogonyaro by an off duty Tunisian coach was a result of a<BR>trivial conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bogonyaro was cheering Nigeria against Cameroon. The<BR>Tunisian then told him 'shut up.' A scuffle ensued and<BR>Bogonyaro called the Tunisian a 'terrorist' in a spiteful<BR>manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just before the end of the games, the Egyptian Boxing<BR>Federation was forced to apologise after that country's<BR>newspapers reported that their boxers were afraid of<BR>contracting aids if they fought South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South Africans hit back and accused Egypt of being<BR>jealous of its performance as Egypt had previously dominated<BR>the games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the Egyptians have been quick to apologise to South<BR>Africa and Zimbabwe, the views of their newspapers have been<BR>generally attributed to the 'superiority complex' North<BR>Africans harbours over Sub-Sahara Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Black African soccer teams, which have been the perennial<BR>underdogs of the North, have consistently complained of bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The headquarters of the Confederation of African Football<BR>is in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, and is mostly staffed by<BR>North Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suspicion is such that whenever there is a soccer match<BR>involving teams from North Africa against those of subthe nationality of the referee.<BR>Sahara, the latter's spectators generally first want to know</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If he happens to come from North Africa, sub-Saharans<BR>attribute questionable decisions to the North's complex of<BR>superiority and prejudice rather than genuine mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the tension is invisible at the sublime political<BR>level where both sub-regions belong to several bodies like<BR>the Organisation of African Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They even agree on bloc votes at the United Nations<BR>inmates of political and economic importance to Africa.<BR>Apolitical cleavage has only been evident over the Sudan<BR>conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An example of this is Sub-Sahara Africa's support for John<BR>Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army. The guerrillas<BR>fighting for a secular state want autonomy for the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This demand has been attributed to the Garang's opposition<BR>to the spread of rigid Islamic edicts throughout the country<BR>by the regime of Omar El-Bashir.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PRETORIA - The South African Government has called for<BR>the immediate restoration of the elected government of the<BR>Comoros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This follows Thursday's coup in the Indian Ocean Islands<BR>by rebels apparently led by veteran French mercenary Bob<BR>Denard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokeswoman Nicole Kritzinger said in a statement the<BR>South African government 'is most concerned at the events in<BR>the Comoros, which constitute a setback for peace in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Government will support international<BR>attempts to restore democratic government in the Comoros'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement added that the South African government<BR>deplored the reported use of force and threat to democratic<BR>order in the Comoros, and appealed to those responsible to<BR>immediately desist from their actions and for life and<BR>property to be respected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a decision was expected later Friday on how<BR>more than 100 South Africans in the Comoros will be<BR>evacuated. Radio reports monitored in Pretoria suggested that<BR>the airport in the capital, Moroni, could be opened Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest news from the Comoros was that fierce fighting<BR>was still raging in Moroni, although only 20 mercenaries were<BR>believed to be involved. The rebels were reported to have<BR>seized control of the military base there and were still<BR>holding President Mohamed Djohar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mercenaries, said to be Europeans and led by Denard,<BR>were reported to have seized the presidential palace and the<BR>radio station in the capital early Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Denard, a French national, is infamous for his work as a<BR>mercenary in Africa, the Arabian peninsula and in other<BR>areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Paris, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs Herve de<BR>Charette condemned Denard's action but failed to say if the<BR>government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe would intervene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> France, the former colonial power, maintains a defence<BR>pact with Comoros and French troops are responsible for the<BR>president's security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been in office since November 26 1989 when he was<BR>democratically elected president to rule the Comoros<BR>population of some 500,000 Arabs, Africans, and Indians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have been 17 successful and failed coups in Comoros<BR>since it gained independence in 1975. Denard, 66, has<BR>participated in all of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Denard, who was born in Belgium but later obtained French<BR>nationality, was in 1990 sentenced to five years in prison in<BR>absentia by the French government for trying to topple the<BR>government of Benin in West Africa in 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Comoros were controlled by Moslem sultans until the<BR>French acquired them between 1841 and 1909. They became a<BR>French overseas territory in 1947.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shumba (35), who is the Mutare Bureau Chief of Modus<BR>Publications, which owns the Financial Gazette and the Sunday<BR>Gazette, was not asked to plead to a charge under the<BR>prevention of corruption act or, alternatively, extortion<BR>when he appeared before senior magistrate Oliver<BR>Mudzongachiso.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was remanded out of custody on ZD 500 (USD 60) bail and<BR>October 30 was set for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prosecutor Teclar Mapota said on May 6, Shumba was at the<BR>Mutare magistrates' court covering a story in which a<BR>Zimbabwean businessman, Robin Douglas Waddacor, was being<BR>charged for contravening a section of the miscellaneous<BR>offences act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After Waddacor was convicted and sentenced to a fine of ZD<BR>250 (USD 30), Shumba allegedly approached him and threatened<BR>to publish the story unless he was paid some money. He then<BR>allegedly demanded ZD 15,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three days later, Waddacor allegedly paid ZD 15,000 to<BR>Shumba in the presence of one Caesar Manyuchi, who had been<BR>jointly charged with Waddacor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Waddacor's story never saw the light of day, according to<BR>the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia- The Organization of African Unity<BR>(OAU) Friday condemned the attempted coup d'etat in the<BR>Comoros Thursday and said the act constituted a serious and<BR>regrettable set-back to the democratic aspirations of the<BR>people of the island nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The OAU strongly condemns this act of destabilization and<BR>the use of mercenaries in a member state and calls for a<BR>rapid and unconditional restoration of the constitutional<BR>order in the Comoros,' the OAU said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement quoted OAU Secretary General, Salim Ahmed<BR>Salim as having expressed deep concern that 'a group of<BR>mercenaries are yet again involved in staging a coup d'etat<BR>in the Comoros'.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salim called for the immediate and unconditional release<BR>of President Mohamed Said Djohar and other government<BR>officials held hostage and urged the 'international community<BR>to assist in ensuring the return of stability and normalcy in<BR>that country'.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have been 17 successful and failed coups in Comoros<BR>since it gained independence in 1975. Denard, 66, has<BR>participated in all of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Denard, who born in Belgium but later obtained French<BR>nationality, was in 1990 sentenced to five years in Prison in<BR>absentia by the French government for trying to topple the<BR>government of Benin in West Africa in 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Comoros were controlled by Moslem sultans until the<BR>French acquired them between 1841 and 1909. They became a<BR>French overseas territory in 1947.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a 1974 referendum on independence, 93 per cent of<BR>Comorians voted for independence. Only the Christian island<BR>of Mayotte, with a 63-percent-vote, opted to stay with<BR>France.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rejecting this, Comoros declared its independence in July<BR>1975 with Ahmed Abdallah as President.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE - The Southern African Development Community (SADC)<BR>will soon have a revolving fund to help the drought-prone<BR>member countries react swiftly to drought emergencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SADC food security sector co-ordinator Reggie Mugwara said<BR>in Harare Friday the USD 30 million fund would get its seed<BR>money from donors, governments and non-governmental<BR>organisations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SADC Council of Ministers last year signed an<BR>agreement establishing how the fund would operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A food reserve had been planned in the late eighties, but<BR>the idea was discarded because of the high costs involved in<BR>the construction of silos and actual storage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'What we learnt from the 1991 drought was that countries<BR>did not plan for emergencies and the fund will assist them to<BR>avert starvation while they look for money elsewhere,'<BR>Mugwara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The region suffered a severe drought in 1991 when rains<BR>stopped prematurely and crops withered and died from moisture<BR>stress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugwara said the fund was not a welfare scheme although<BR>borrowing would be at concessionary interest rates to<BR>encourage countries to utilise the facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the provisions of the fund, borrowing countries<BR>would be obliged to buy their grain from within the region<BR>and only when the other countries were not able to supply,<BR>would external exporters be approached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the early stages, the fund would cater only for the<BR>purchase of maize. This will, however, be expanded to include<BR>other crops when the capital base increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugwara said the finance facility would encourage<BR>increased production within SADC because it would encourage<BR>supplies to countries with crop shortfalls.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - Zambia and Namibia have launched a joint<BR>tuberculosis (TB) control programme under a German-supported<BR>10-year health project expected to cover other Southern<BR>African Development Community (SADC) states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health experts from the two counties, including<BR>representatives from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and<BR>the German Government's Technical Cooperation Agency (GTZ)<BR>Friday in Lusaka finalised technical details of the anti-TB<BR>programme to be launched in both countries early in 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GTZ officials said that the agency has budgeted some 400<BR>million German marks (1.5 German marks = one United States<BR>dollar) for the first phase of the programme to run for three<BR>years before reappraisal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement released at the Lusaka meeting by the WHO<BR>delegation in Geneva welcomed the initiative by Zambia and<BR>Namibia as being in line with the recently mooted Southern<BR>African TB Control Initiative (SATCI).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said that the project will help to strengthen the<BR>national TB control programmes in the two Southern African<BR>states through the use of modern strategies for prevention<BR>and treatment of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health officials estimate that there are about 300-400 TB<BR>cases out every 100,000 population in both countries which<BR>have a combined population of some 11 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Namibia has an estimated 1.5 total population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 12-member SADC in 1993 mooted the establishment of<BR>SATCI to coordinate national TB control programmes in the<BR>sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is expected to be officially inaugurated in the<BR>Namibian capital, Windhoek, in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO says TB now causes about 26 percent of the deaths<BR>in the developing countries and is by far the most important<BR>cause of deaths in HIV positive individuals in sub-Saharan<BR>Africa.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History (Los Angeles)<BR>September 1, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Los Angeles - African ceramic traditions will be explored<BR>in two exhibitions, &quot;Ceramic Gestures: New Vessels by<BR>Magdalene Odundo&quot; and &quot;African Ceramics: Selections from the<BR>Permanent Collection,&quot; at the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural<BR>History Sept. 22 through March 3. African ceramics exist in a<BR>staggering range of forms and functions, and the paired<BR>presentations clearly demonstrate the enormous vitality of<BR>these traditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 15 new works of art featured in &quot;Ceramic Gestures,&quot;<BR>are by the Kenya-born, London-based artist Magdalene Odundo.<BR>These pieces evoke a strong association with the forms and<BR>processes of African pottery, which has been made by women<BR>for thousands of years. The first solo traveling exhibition<BR>in America of Odundo's works, &quot;Ceramic Gestures&quot; features<BR>this internationally recognized artist's sensual and<BR>exquisitely fluid creations. The works reveal unmistakable<BR>traces of a long African tradition, blending multiple<BR>associations and meanings with functional references.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Odundo is equally conversant with Euro-American<BR>modernism,&quot; said Marla C. Berns, curator of the exhibition.<BR>&quot;She brings to her work a love for the universal language of<BR>clay and a familiarity with the world's ceramic history going<BR>back to the vessels of antiquity, to the pottery of Jomon<BR>Japan, to the Native North American ceramics and, more<BR>recently, to the legacy of Bernard Leach and the early 20th&quot;Ceramic Gestures&quot; incorporates a telling video interview<BR>century British vessel tradition.&quot;<BR>with the artist. Odundo has described her work as capturing<BR>the unfurling of a plant, the posture of intimate<BR>conversation, or the silhouette of a Kenyan woman bound in<BR>layers of cloth. Several critics describe Odundo's vessels as<BR>embodying the &quot;stillness of a dancer,&quot; suggesting her effort<BR>to capture in the silent medium of clay the energy of<BR>animating living things. Each of Odundo's vessels is hand<BR>built, primarily using a coiling technique. She has<BR>purposefully shunned the wheel, with its restraints of<BR>rotational symmetry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Odundo reads in the vessels' natural forms clear physical<BR>correlations to the bodies of women. The generous curve of a<BR>pot belly echoes pregnancy. Vessels with sharply angled<BR>mouths, tipping backward in long, graceful sweeps, evoke the<BR>elongated foreheads and flaring coiffures of Mangbetu women<BR>of Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although recognizably containers, Odundo's vessels are<BR>destined to remain empty. Conversely, &quot;African Ceramics:<BR>Selections from the Permanent Collection,&quot; features a crossfunctions and shaped to aesthetically enhance their use.<BR>cultural survey of ceramics made for domestic or ritual<BR>Dating from 1500 B.C. to the present, 61 objects from 10<BR>countries were chosen from the Fowler Museum's renowned<BR>holdings of more than 700 African works of clay. The vessels<BR>range from food bowls to beerpots, oil lamp to meat dryer.<BR>Ritual works include ornamented pottery for funerary<BR>offerings and anthropomorphic vessels used in healing rites</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Especially compelling are three massive royal pipes<BR>representing a human, a rabbit and a ram paying homage to a<BR>king, created for use at the celebrated court of Sultan Njoya<BR>in the Cameroon grasslands. A 600-year-old, terra-cotta<BR>sculpture of a kneeling female figure from the inland Niger<BR>Delta of Mali provides an example of ceramics from medieval<BR>West African urban centers. The oldest work in the exhibition<BR>is a New Kingdom Egyptian vessel of about 1500 B.C.,<BR>excavated next to a household shrine in the Nubian fortress<BR>at Askut as part of UCLA's involvement in the UNESCO Aswan<BR>High Dam Salvage Campaign.<BR>The complete range of pottery from Bonakire, a single village<BR>in Western Ghana, offers a comprehensive study of form and<BR>purpose within one tradition. This group of works is<BR>accompanied by a continuously running slide program that<BR>documents techniques of production and contexts of use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not all these works serve as containers. A commanding<BR>19th-century sculpture of a lion from Angola once guarded a<BR>cemetery. Elaborate, open-work ceramics from the Igbo peoples<BR>of Nigeria serve as display pieces for diviners' shrines.<BR>These inspiring works also are used as dance sculptures by<BR>titled women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Ceramic Gestures&quot; was organized by the University Art<BR>Museum, University of California, Santa Barbara, curated by<BR>the museum's director Marla C. Berns, and is accompanied by a<BR>fully illustrated catalogue. &quot;African Ceramics&quot; was curated<BR>by Doran H. Ross, the Fowler Museum's deputy director and<BR>curator of African collections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - SENT BY FAX<BR>His Excellency President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni<BR>Office of the President<BR>State House Kampala UGANDA<BR>Your Excellency:<BR>The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) expresses its<BR>deepest concern over the August 28 death in police custody of<BR>Hussein Musa Njuki, the 42-year old editor of the Islamic<BR>opposition weekly bulletin Assalaam. Njuki died four days<BR>after he was detained by state security agents. CPJ also<BR>writes to protest the detention of Haruna Kanabi, editor in<BR>chief of the Islamic opposition weekly newsletter, Shariat,<BR>on charges of sedition. Njuki and Kanabi were arrested on the<BR>same day, on the same charges.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Njuki was arrested on Friday, August 25, 1995, and<BR>immediately taken to the Criminal Investigations Division<BR>(CID). While CPJ has received several versions of the nature<BR>of his arrest, it is certain that he was taken into custody<BR>by a group of plain clothes men from the Anti-Robbery Squad,<BR>an extension of the domestic government security force, the<BR>Internal Security Organization (ISO). One report to CPJ<BR>claimed that Njuki had been suffering from an illness that<BR>had considerably weakened him, and the shock of the ambush by<BR>the ISO squad exacerbated his sickness to fatal proportions.<BR>Another report states that Njuki was in perfect health before<BR>the arrest and was beaten to death by ISO agents. Yet another<BR>report contends that he collapsed during an attempt to escape<BR>and died in hospital of a heart attack. A police guard<BR>remained in Njuki's hospital room throughout the duration of<BR>his stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Njuki was arrested on accusations of sedition stemming<BR>from an August 18 article in Assalaam titled, &quot;Multi-party<BR>democracy will not return to Uganda until Museveni dies.&quot; He<BR>was to be officially charged with sedition on Monday, August<BR>28, the day of his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a related matter, Haruna Kanabi of Shariat was arrested<BR>the same day as Njuki, Friday, August 25, for publishing an<BR>allegedly seditious article that also appeared on August 18<BR>titled, &quot;Rwanda is now a Ugandan province.&quot; Kanabi was<BR>officially charged with sedition on Monday, August 28. Twelve<BR>days later, he remains in detention, as requests for bail<BR>have been rejected. This rejection was on the basis of a<BR>previous case in which journalist Lawrence Kiwanuka fled the<BR>country, for fear of persecution, during court proceedings --<BR>a move which the court deemed &quot;jumping bail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The matter of Kanabi's release on bail has been taken to<BR>the higher court: a process which can last indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The coincidence of these two arrests have as well an<BR>historical link. In 1993, Njuki and Kanabi were colleagues at<BR>Shariat when they were arrested, charged with sedition and<BR>detained for many days, an incident documented in CPJ's<BR>annual report for 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a nonpartisan group of journalists dedicated to the<BR>defense of press freedom and the protection of our colleagues<BR>worldwide, CPJ strongly urges Your Excellency to launch an<BR>immediate investigation into the death of Hussein Musa Njuki,<BR>order an autopsy, and to ensure that those responsible in any<BR>way be brought to justice. The Committee also urges Your<BR>Excellency to sanction the release of Haruna Kanabi<BR>immediately.<BR>Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - THE rush for satellite television is on. If<BR>the Independent Broadcasting Authority reports stands --<BR>bringing a two-year wait before South Africa gets a private<BR>terrestrial television station -- new broadcasters will take<BR>to the skies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the implication of the report released this week<BR>by the IBA into the future of the public broadcaster. The IBA<BR>proposed that the SABC lose one of its channels by the end of<BR>1997 and gain a satellite channel then. On this<BR>recommendation, South Africa will only get a non-SABC<BR>terrestrial channel in January 1988.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a boon for satellite television, which will have<BR>over two years in which to establish its programming and<BR>audience with only limited competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delay is certain to be the focus of debate.<BR>Telecommunications Minister Pallo Jordan signaled this from<BR>the outset by saying he was &quot;concerned that the delay in<BR>introducing the private terrestrial channel might overregulated competition&quot;. Jordan added that he was &quot;not at all<BR>protect the SABC and defeat the disciplinary aims of<BR>comfortable with the proposal on the SABC's channels&quot; and<BR>wanted Parliament to examine the IBA's recommendations<BR>closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Dison of Media and Broadcasting Consultants welcomed<BR>the report &quot;as a major step forward in establishing a<BR>diversity of voices&quot;.<BR>But he described the television proposals as worrying. &quot;As I<BR>see it, the problem with the delay is that it will have the<BR>tendency to weaken free-to-air television against satellite<BR>broadcasting,&quot; he said.<BR>SABC chief executive Zwelakhe Sisulu also spoke strongly<BR>against the loss of a channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think IBA has done a reasonable job, given the time<BR>they had and the constraints placed upon them in getting the<BR>information they needed,&quot; says Jonathan Procter, former<BR>director-general of Bop Broadcasting Corporation. &quot;It has not<BR>taken a populist position. Previous reports on broadcasting<BR>in South Africa were laden with compromise. It is perfectly<BR>understandable that the SABC should be given two years to<BR>prepare itself.&quot; He believes there will still be<BR>opportunities for terrestrial broadcasters, although he<BR>agrees that the report could precipitate a rush for satellite<BR>television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quentin Green, former chief executive: television at SABC<BR>and now with Free to Air, an outfit which -- as its name<BR>suggests -- is to apply for a terrestrial television licence,<BR>says, &quot;Our general comment is that the report looks very<BR>good. We do agree with the SABC that it should retain three<BR>channels. We also think the entire process should be speeded<BR>up. As it stands it opens the door for foreign broadcasters<BR>to come in via satellite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Green adds that they are not considering the satellite<BR>option at all. &quot;We are still looking at an advertiserYet the prospects for regional television might have been<BR>supported full-spectrum channel.<BR>significantly enhanced as a result of the IBA report. Such<BR>regional television could take the form of regional windows<BR>within the national public broadcasting service (NPBS),<BR>although there is also the possibility that the new private<BR>commercial channel could be a network of regional stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report suggests that because of the high cost of<BR>television, a regional service should fall to the NPBS.<BR>According to the report, &quot;financial analysis done for the<BR>authority suggested that the new private channel to come on<BR>line in 1998 could not profitably be divided into two or<BR>three regional stations, even with extensive networking and<BR>sharing of costs.&quot; According to an IBA official, however, the<BR>opportunity still exists for a regional commercial<BR>broadcaster to apply for a licence to broadcast. This<BR>decision would hinge on whether the regional station could<BR>prove its viability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report acknowledges that &quot;regional television could<BR>draw on a whole layer of advertising that has not and will<BR>not be available to national television&quot;. It adds that this<BR>would encourage the decentralisation of television<BR>production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nick Taylor, who has the CityTV franchise -- a regional TV<BR>station based in Toronto, Canada -- for South Africa,<BR>believes that regional TV is viable if done appropriately.<BR>&quot;We can set up stations with 10 or 15 people,&quot; he says. &quot;TV<BR>doesn't have to be high cost glamour ... All you need are<BR>good people who are passionate about what they are doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report recommends that regional windows of one hour a<BR>day be provided for on television. This is expected to cost<BR>R122-million a year. It is proposed that Parliament should<BR>foot the bill. &quot;Regional windows within the public broadcast<BR>service would not fulfill the needs of the provinces. They<BR>would be controlled from the centre,&quot; says Taylor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This view was also held by Bop Broadcasting Corporation<BR>director-general Solomon Kotane. BopBC had hopes of providing<BR>a national backbone service to regional broadcasters, who<BR>could then slot in their own programming as and when it<BR>became available. But many of the regions have not yet<BR>defined their needs in terms of a regional public broadcaster<BR>and many do not have facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't have an ex-homeland broadcaster and it would be<BR>expensive to set up the facility,&quot; says Narina Riskowitz,<BR>acting head of communications for KwaZulu- Natal. She adds<BR>that they would encourage the licensing of a private<BR>broadcaster for the region.<BR>Whether it grants a licence to one national channel or a<BR>network of regional channels, it appears that the licence<BR>which will be granted will be a full spectrum rather than a<BR>thematic licence such as a sport or music channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report further specifies that &quot;in selecting applicants<BR>for private licences, the authority will make ownership and<BR>control by previously disadvantaged South Africans an<BR>important criterion.&quot; It may also require broadcasters to<BR>serve sparsely populated as well as densely populated areas,<BR>carefully weighing the &quot;public interest and the financial<BR>implications&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IBA also intends to indicate minimum or threshold<BR>requirements for specific programme categories. The objective<BR>is that, &quot;viewed collectively, television is catering to the<BR>needs of the public&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This would in effect create certain public service<BR>mandates for commercial broadcasters, requiring some level of<BR>educational and informative programming at &quot;appropriate&quot;<BR>times. Subscription broadcasters are &quot;expected to make a<BR>contribution to national development along with all other<BR>broadcasting services&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With regard to community television, the report states<BR>that &quot;the Authority recognises the importance of community<BR>television and will endeavour to licence as many of these as<BR>technological and financial capability permits.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Local coal producers will be vying to<BR>clinch the remaining coal contracts for Eskom's R10-billion<BR>Majuba power station which, when completed, will consume some<BR>13-million tons of coal a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The power station, which has a design capacity of 40 036<BR>megawatts, will entail the construction of six sets, each<BR>consisting of a boiler, turbine, alternator and unit<BR>transformer, and capable of operating independently.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sandton - The road to a full-scale market economy in<BR>Mozambique is, like peace, &quot;irreversible&quot;, President Joachim<BR>Chissano said in Sandton recently when he addressed a special<BR>meeting of business people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said joint ventures for the development of major<BR>infrastructure were the &quot;only policy option available&quot; and<BR>&quot;we may no longer guarantee the development of our countries<BR>in an isolated manner&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Mozambique had successfully attracted foreign<BR>investment in mining. The country's minerals include bauxite,<BR>chromium and iron ore estimated at 167-million tons. The<BR>rehabilitation of the Moats coal mine was, he said, &quot;most<BR>advanced&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa is playing a major role in Mozambican<BR>infrastructural development. Recently, Minister of Transport<BR>Mac Maharaj, Trade and Industry Minister Trevor Manuel and<BR>Minister of Public Enterprise Stella Sicgau visited<BR>Mozambique to discuss the upgrading of Maputo harbour and the<BR>construction of the Maputo-Nkomati railway and road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Development Bank of South Africa made known this week<BR>a R3-million loan, payable over 15 years at 14 percent, to<BR>the Telecommunicatoes de Mozambique to improve<BR>telecommunications between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African farmers, Chissano said, are &quot;looking forward<BR>to moving to Mozambique&quot;. Only 10 percent of Mozambique's<BR>arable land is under cultivation. Land is not for sale but<BR>long-term leases are available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plans for the Zambezi Valley Development Programme,<BR>broached by the colonial regime to provide a grid system of<BR>dams and electricity and stimulate agriculture, were in the<BR>&quot;advanced planning stage&quot; and could involve Brazil, Portugal,<BR>South Africa and other development agencies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1054 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>September 1, 1995<BR>by Reg Rumney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Foreign competition is the biggest threat<BR>to the margins of the banking industry -- but foreign banks<BR>are unlikely to want to upset the domestic applecart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alan McConnochie of broker Ed Hern Rudolph, writing in<BR>accountancy firm KPMG's 1995 Banking Survey, identified<BR>foreign competition as one of three long-term issues for<BR>South African banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other two are the attitude of the Reserve Bank and the<BR>government, and the co-operation on pricing between the<BR>banks.<BR>Whether banks can sustain wide margins between the cost of<BR>borrowing and the cost of lending, essential for good<BR>returns, depends on those three factors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McConnochie said he did not see any threat from the<BR>authorities. &quot;We expect that the authorities will encourage<BR>wide margins because without a strong banking industry we<BR>cannot fund the economic growth required or be an<BR>international partner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nor did he see an end to the present banking focus on<BR>products and services rather than rate-cutting. &quot;Banks<BR>learned long ago that nobody wins a price war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If foreign banks entered the South African market in a big<BR>way, used cheap foreign capital to upset local margins and<BR>buy market share, South African banks, small by world<BR>standards, would have a problem.<BR>But, he said, foreign banks were likely to concentrate on<BR>getting good returns rather than undercutting local banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banks performed strongly in 1994, for the sixth year in a<BR>row. Share price growth continued to exceed earnings growth<BR>by a wide margin. In 1994 the Banks Index jumped 30,3 percent<BR>(1993:37,5 percent) while earnings grew 13,4 percent (1993:15<BR>percent). By comparison the Industrial Index rose by 25,5<BR>percent and its earnings by 11,9 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The banking sector, the survey noted, is dominated by the<BR>big four commercial banks: Amalgamated Banks of South Africa,<BR>Standard Bank Investment Corporation, First National Bank<BR>Holdings and Nedcor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Total banking assets grew by 16,9 percent to R343- billion<BR>last year, according to the survey. Advances grew at a<BR>slightly lower rate at 16,3 percent, with most of the growth<BR>coming from mortgage lending and installment finance.<BR>Mortgage lending grew 19,9 percent, and installment finance<BR>19,4 percent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The survey notes the surge in mortgage lending is<BR>supported by the low-risk weighting it carries for capital<BR>adequacy purposes, and it is likely to see substantial growth<BR>over the next few years as the government and business try to<BR>provide housing to more people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overdrafts and loans to the corporate sector increased by<BR>15,5 percent for the year, indicating strong demand for<BR>credit by business, said the survey, albeit lower than the<BR>growth in mortgage lending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The level of retail lending remained virtually constant<BR>showing weaker demand for consumer credit other than<BR>installment sales and mortgages.&quot; McConnochie expected the<BR>outlook for South African bank profits this year to be fair.<BR>He reckoned the Banks Index should show earnings per share<BR>growth of 20 percent, better than inflation although well<BR>below the 26 percent forecast for industrial shares this<BR>year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He foresaw strong growth in banks' credit advances and fee<BR>income, reducing bad debts and a lower corporate tax rate<BR>this year as well as a higher return earned on &quot;free&quot;<BR>shareholders' funds as interest rates continue to rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These positive factors should more than make up for the<BR>slight squeeze in the banks' margins and a possible increase<BR>in liquid asset requirements, said McConnochie, as the<BR>Reserve Bank tried to slow the rate of growth in bank lending</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted that margins tend to widen at the bottom of the<BR>interest rate cycle and narrow at the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McConnochie, writing before the increase in the prime rate<BR>to 18,5 percent, said he did not expect banks to slow the<BR>growth in advances to 10 percent as requested by the Reserve<BR>Bank, so he believed a further one or two percentage point<BR>rise in interest rates likely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>September 1, 1995<BR>by Meshack Mabogoane</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A month after his appointment as coMasekela at Kippie's in downtown Johannesburg last week was a<BR>director of the State Theatre, the appearance of Hugh<BR>fitting reminder that he is both the supreme embodiment of a<BR>cultural stream that has been exiled from stately<BR>consideration, and a musical establishment in his own right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For his followers -- a rainbow lot who crammed the tiny<BR>Kippie's every session of his four-day sojourn -- this was an<BR>occasion to celebrate the acknowledgment of his contribution<BR>to South African music. But it was also a moment for Masekela<BR>himself to acknowledge their kudos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He did so by taking his music back to its roots,<BR>demonstrating his indebtedness to the moving spirit and best<BR>tradition of jazz. Masekela is as consummate a jazz musician<BR>as he has been an exponent and developer of local music. This<BR>synthesis is personified in what can be called Masekelia,<BR>just as the musical phenomenon personified by Duke Ellington<BR>has been called Ellingtonia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masekela drew heavily from his classic repertoire:<BR>Stimela, Grazing in the Grass, Ntjilo Ntjilo, Free Mandela,<BR>Nomali, and so on. This was expected, and enthusiastically<BR>received. But there ended Masekela the predictable. The<BR>pieces served only as a canvas on which the musicians were to<BR>demonstrate their craft and colours. The tunes became<BR>vehicles for extensive and elaborate improvisations which<BR>gave the music a sublime depth and density.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jimmy Dludlu on bass guitar played energetically, yet<BR>maintained a cool restraint that prevented possible excesses<BR>that could have turned his staccato strumming to Jimi<BR>Hendrix-like crescendos. Kwasi Shange on drums, though rowdy<BR>on occasion, managed to return to well- measured timesupportive percussionist, John Hassan.<BR>keeping, and was complemented by the evasive and finely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khaya Mahlangu, on flute and tenor, the group's musical<BR>director and &quot;philosopher&quot;, seemed content to bolster the<BR>deeper coherence and organic substance that the group<BR>produced so well. Mahlangu was the main anchor and stimulus<BR>that enabled Masekela to elaborate on the customary<BR>Masekelian statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The potential for this group to be the best that Masekela<BR>has put together so far is enormous. In effect, it could<BR>reduce his dominance while injecting his substance to produce<BR>an organic sound that would be greater than the sum of its<BR>individual parts. The over-towering Masekela would not be so<BR>much subdued as sublimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On average, the group played six tunes over one-and-aimprovisation the main course, and the concert a jazz event<BR>half hours -- 10 to 15 minutes a tune. This made<BR>par excellence. And the tunes were liberated from a dance<BR>trance even though the rhythm was dense and strong. This was<BR>intentional, to convey the message that Masekela needs to be<BR>listened to seriously. When a rowdy group shouted &quot;Go, Hugh,<BR>go&quot;, he stopped playing and threatened to go home if they did<BR>not stop. At the end of the session, he pleaded that the<BR>&quot;gods of Africa&quot; should help people appreciate music. You<BR>gotta dig, really.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masekela at Kippie's put paid to the view that he is no<BR>longer creative, but just resting on his reputation. It's a<BR>perception that seems credible, given both his immense<BR>success -- which often spawns complacency -- and middle-age.<BR>Bra Hugh ain't that young no more, and the elder statesman<BR>status has fallen on him with ease. But, at Kippie's, his<BR>format and on-stage playing were fresh and inspiring,<BR>pointing at things still to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is no paradox that Masekela, who for three decades<BR>abroad played an Africentric or home-brewed music, should now<BR>return to jazz-based explorations. He is at the vanguard of a<BR>new musical development that is emerging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masekela senses this. In closing the concerts, he revealed<BR>great expectations when he said: &quot;After 30 years of exile, I<BR>am pleased that South Africa can produce good musicians in<BR>spite of isolation.&quot; He seems determined to add his stately<BR>weight to their development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sunday afternoon concert at Kippie's by the Soweto<BR>Youth Jazz Orchestra vindicated this hope. The orchestra,<BR>made up of students of the Mano Technical College in<BR>Dobsonville, performed an array of classic jazz pieces. Tunes<BR>by Joe Zawinul (Mercy, Mercy, Mercy and Birdland), Charlie<BR>Parker (Billy's Bounce, Now's the Time) and Thelonious Monk<BR>(Well, You Needn't) were played with vigour and technical<BR>finesse. The group's solid jazz and overall musical grounding<BR>are beyond doubt; so, too, is their rootedness in local<BR>music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With trumpet virtuoso Prince Lengoasa as one of their<BR>tutors, the orchestra could become a powerhouse in producing<BR>solid jazz musicians, much as Fuba has done. By the way,<BR>Lengoasa's solo on Some Day My Prince Will Come, a tune made<BR>a classic jazz vehicle by Davis, was remarkable for its selfsucceeded is a tribute to the urge to sound original; should<BR>conscious effort to avoid Milesian licks and cliches. That he<BR>this spirit take root among his students, it will contribute<BR>to the search for an authentic jazz sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Truly, jazz is alive and set to live long in this country.<BR>Kippie's should continue its safari.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>September 1, 1995<BR>by Stefaans Brummer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - THE irony of their own attendance at<BR>Monday's Southern African Development Community summit could<BR>not have been lost on Constand Viljoen and Pik Botha. A<BR>succession of regional leaders made sure they had no chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both men sat attentively in the large but select World<BR>Trade Centre audience when three presidents, including Nelson<BR>Mandela, made reference to apartheid South Africa's<BR>destabilisation of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From the stage, nine more leaders -- presidents and prime<BR>ministers or their deputies, most of whose countries at some<BR>stage had felt the effects of a decade and a half or more of<BR>South African overt and covert military aggression -- peered<BR>down on Viljoen, who headed the South African Defence Force<BR>during the roughest of that time, and Botha, who as longcampaign estimated to have cost a million lives and more than<BR>serving Minister of Foreign Affairs must have had input in a<BR>a hundred billion rand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela thanked other SADC countries in his welcoming<BR>speech for their role in &quot;the liberation of South Africa and<BR>the end of Southern Africa's destabilisation&quot;; Tanzanian<BR>President Ali Hassan Mwinyi referred to &quot;economic and<BR>political destabilisation of the region ... used as a grand<BR>strategy to delay the liberation of Namibia and South<BR>Africa&quot;; and Botswana President Ketumile Masire spoke of &quot;the<BR>impact of apartheid-sponsored destabilisation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in a sense, this year's summit was the final farewell<BR>to that period. South Africa, who last year joined SADC --<BR>founded in 1980 as the Southern African Development Codecreasing dependency on a destabilising South Africa -- not<BR>ordination Conference (SADCC) with the express purpose of<BR>only hosted the summit this year, but also played a leading<BR>role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela, always the great reconciler, made it clear that<BR>the past had to be consigned to the past. &quot;SADC's mission<BR>reflects the reality that Southern Africa has long passed the<BR>stage of lamenting the privations of the past. The challenge<BR>is to find within ourselves the resources to overcome this<BR>legacy, with the co- operation of the international<BR>community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So the wheel had turned a full circle. There was Viljoen,<BR>now leader of the Freedom Front, the man who has gained<BR>acceptance from those same leaders on the stage for his<BR>scheme to export Afrikaner farmers to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Botha, now Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs in<BR>Mandela's Cabinet, had the honour of co-signing with his SADC<BR>counterparts a memorandum on the establishment of a regional<BR>power pool.<BR>Security in the region has come a long way since SADC, and<BR>its sibling body, the Frontline States, joined battle with<BR>the old South Africa. Mwinyi, who is retiring as Tanzanian<BR>president this year, recounted how &quot;when I came to power ten<BR>years ago, Namibia was not yet free. South Africa was still<BR>governed by and apartheid regime. Civil war and discord<BR>characterised life in Angola and Mozambique.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, even Angola appears to be on the road to peace.<BR>Democracy is on the upswing in SADC countries and in the<BR>space of 18 months South Africa, Malawi, Mozambique and<BR>shortly Tanzania will have held their first unfettered multiSADC, after South Africa joined it, and with a substantial<BR>party elections.<BR>role played by South Africa, has successfully averted crises<BR>in the Mozambican elections and the Lesotho coup attempt.<BR>Lesotho's prime minister Ntsu Mokhehle thanked his SADC<BR>colleagues for their mediation in his country, &quot;Not because<BR>you re-instated my administration, but because you<BR>demonstrated the supremacy and invincibility of democracy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps South Africa's transition from apartheid bully to<BR>a stable and co-operative neighbour, the domino that started<BR>a democratic trend, will yet prove to be SADC's greatest<BR>asset.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>September 1, 1995<BR>by Stefaans Brummer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - This week's SADC summit saw quibbling among<BR>the region's leaders, but a few strides were made<BR>nevertheless. When the Southern African Development Community<BR>heads of state and government postponed their lunch at<BR>Johannesburg's World Trade Centre on Monday, observers<BR>suspected there was serious quibbling in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two closed sessions of an hour and a half each, originally<BR>to have been broken by lunch, stretched to a solid four and a<BR>half hours, and only well into the afternoon did the leaders<BR>allow themselves a bite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What the delay meant for the caterers must be clear; what<BR>it signified about unity of purpose and direction in SADC is<BR>any body's guess. For, in spite of SADC's slogan of<BR>&quot;integration through commitment, co-operation and popular<BR>participation&quot;, the people of the region do not get to hear<BR>details of what went on behind those closed doors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that there was less than unanimity on the part of the<BR>11 Southern African presidents and prime ministers or their<BR>deputies (12 after Mauritius' membership application was<BR>approved during the summit) can be gauged from the fruits of<BR>the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, in perhaps the<BR>most candid admission that not all went as planned, said<BR>afterwards: &quot;There is no doubt that this has been one of the<BR>most significant SADC summits ever ... There are issues where<BR>we may not have reached complete consensus, but they all fade<BR>into insignificance by comparison to the great strides we<BR>have made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit did indeed make &quot;strides&quot;, in comparison to<BR>SADC's earlier record of much talk and little action. But not<BR>all would agree with Mandela's judgment that the<BR>disagreements &quot;fade into insignificance&quot; against those<BR>strides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here is the scorecard:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -SADC's leaders signed a Protocol on Shared Watercourse<BR>Systems, perhaps the first concrete agreement yet signed by<BR>the body in pursuance of its aim of regional integration. But<BR>the protocol, which is to ensure upstream states do not use<BR>more than their share of water or pollute shared water<BR>systems, was not signed by Angola and Zambia as their<BR>Cabinets &quot;had not yet completed their consultations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -SADC energy ministers were directed by the summit to sign<BR>an &quot;inter-governmental memorandum of understanding&quot; on a<BR>Southern African Power Pool. While it showed an advance on<BR>the aim to create a common pool of electricity in the region,<BR>the memorandum appeared to be a step down from a protocol<BR>establishing the pool, which had been envisaged to be signed<BR>by the heads of state and government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -Mauritius' application for membership was granted. Like<BR>South Africa, which joined SADC a year ago, Mauritius is an<BR>economic powerhouse compared to the rest of the region and<BR>may bring muscle and expertise to the block.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -The summit approved a request from Comesa, the Common<BR>Market for East and Southern Africa, for a joint summit with<BR>SADC to remove tension between the two bodies. SADC decided a<BR>year ago that its members should resign membership of Comesa<BR>(thereby creating two, rather than one, trade block), but<BR>many SADC members still retain dual membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Mauritius joining SADC (as opposed to Comesa, which<BR>was also an option) appeared to be a victory for SADC, the<BR>fact that the joint summit was approved and that the<BR>resignations have not happened point to a possible rethink of<BR>the earlier decision, or a reluctance on the part of some<BR>SADC members to make a clear choice for the southern body.<BR>SADC executive secretary Kaire Mbuende said after the summit:<BR>&quot;I am not going to demand from any country to know whether<BR>they have pulled out or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -Perhaps most importantly, the Association of Southern<BR>African States (Asas), a political arm to complement SADC's<BR>development aims with a regional conflict resolution and<BR>security co-ordination facility, was not agreed. Last year's<BR>summit approved the creation of such a &quot;sector&quot; in SADC, but<BR>the idea was revised -- and supposedly finalised for approval<BR>by this year's summit -- by SADC foreign ministers at a<BR>meeting in Harare in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The March revision decided Asas should be a loose<BR>association with direct input by SADC heads of state and a<BR>revolving chair, rather than the &quot;sector&quot; -- which in SADCSADC's secretariat. As a &quot;sector&quot;, it would also have been<BR>speak would have meant it falling under the authority of<BR>co-ordinated and chaired by a single member country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monday's summit decided to refer Asas back to the member<BR>states and their foreign and security ministers for more<BR>&quot;consultation&quot;. What had been decided twice before had to be<BR>revised again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new review appears to be based on the realisation that<BR>security ministers had mistakenly been omitted from the<BR>process earlier, but could also relate to the aspirations of<BR>a state like Zimbabwe, which has been eyeing the chair of<BR>Asas, and the secretariat of SADC, both of whom would benefit<BR>were the body to be a sector (under the secretariat and with<BR>a non-revolving chair).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether the above constitutes &quot;great strides&quot; or not, in<BR>the end, will have to be judged by the people of the region.<BR>Mandela acknowledged as much in his closing address, when he<BR>urged the leaders of the region to &quot;move to put into practice<BR>the decisions we have taken&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>September 1, 1995<BR>by Stefaans Brummer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The sale of a prime Telkom-owned property,<BR>apparently at a fire-sale price, has the telecommunications<BR>minister lambasting his officials. Posts and<BR>Telecommunications Minister Pallo Jordan has questioned<BR>Telkom's sale of a prestigious Cape Town Waterfront property,<BR>suggesting that the deal lost the state-owned company<BR>millions or rand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Documents in possession of the Mail &amp; Guardian reveal how<BR>an explanation given by Telkom for the sale was flatly<BR>rejected by Jordan with the words: &quot;Crap. Totally<BR>unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Telkom, though no longer state-run, is still 100 percentthe Cabinet.<BR>owned by the state and ultimately answerable to Jordan and<BR>Jordan last week confirmed the veracity of the documents,<BR>saying: &quot;My concern was that the property had been sold below<BR>the price it could have fetched, given its location. I have<BR>heard nothing thus far that has reduced my apprehension.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The property, the disused Gallows Hill telephone exchange<BR>site and building dryly referred to in the documentation as<BR>&quot;Erf 14501&quot;, is now better known as Victoria Junction, one of<BR>Cape Town's most prestigious developments. The documentation<BR>-- mailed anonymously to the M&amp;G -- shows Jordan writing to<BR>Telkom chairman Dikgang Moseneke last November, and again in<BR>February, asking for clarity on the R12-million deal between<BR>Telkom and the directors of developers Newport Property<BR>Group, clinched on October 13 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the first letter, Jordan said: &quot;From appearances, and I<BR>stress, appearance, this was a deal that could have brought<BR>the company much more money ... I don't want you to start<BR>making enemies in the management board, but if the<BR>allegations here are true, this is a matter that needs<BR>looking into.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In February, Jordan wrote to Moseneke urging an<BR>investigation and asking to be informed of the facts. &quot;In the<BR>context of the demands that will be placed on Telkom to<BR>realise universal service, I cannot take lightly the disposal<BR>of state assets at low prices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told Moseneke that from his own inquiries it appeared<BR>the market value was &quot;far greater&quot; than the R12-million<BR>(including VAT) paid for it; that there was no tendering;<BR>that &quot;a leading property developer in this city, who operates<BR>in that precise area ... had not heard about the transaction<BR>until it appeared in the press&quot;; and that it appeared the<BR>property might have been sold via another party, realising a<BR>profit for a third party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jordan told the M&amp;G he had not had final word from<BR>Moseneke. &quot;I have to remind him, but he has had other fish to<BR>fry.&quot;<BR>Jordan's suspicions appear to have been raised initially by<BR>Cape Town businesswoman Cathy Murat, who had approached<BR>Telkom in the middle of last year for the partial donation of<BR>the property in terms of the company's social investment<BR>programme. Her plan was to set up an interactive children's<BR>museum on the site. She wrote to Jordan in November, and soon<BR>after that Jordan first wrote to Moseneke for an explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He got that explanation -- ostensibly from Moseneke -- in<BR>mid-December. &quot;I am satisfied there was nothing irregular in<BR>the selling of the property and the selling price of R12valuation of R10,4-million,&quot; a letter in the name of<BR>million is market-related and well in excess of the sworn<BR>Moseneke, but signed on his behalf by Telkom's then-managing<BR>director Danie du Toit, informed Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three days later Du Toit, who left Telkom in March this<BR>year, told Jordan that the letter in Moseneke's name had<BR>&quot;been released by me&quot; in the absence of Moseneke and &quot;in view<BR>of the urgency of the matter&quot; -- but that it was being<BR>withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In February, before his second letter to Moseneke, Jordan<BR>was confronted with a response to Murat's objection in the<BR>form of a letter, in his name, which he was supposed to sign.<BR>It appears to have been drafted partly by Pieter Feenstra,<BR>general manager of Telkom properties. Jordan went to the<BR>extraordinary length of crossing out all three pages of it,<BR>appending a note: &quot;Crap!!! Totally unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The letter would have had Jordan telling Murat: &quot;A full<BR>report has now been made available to me and, quite frankly,<BR>it is clear that Telkom acted strictly within their sphere of<BR>responsibilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Feenstra this week stood by the explanation, saying Telkom<BR>had had &quot;as many as&quot; four valuations done on the property. An<BR>independent valuation had shown it to be worth R10,4-million,<BR>including VAT. He defended the decision not to put the<BR>property out to tender, saying experience had taught &quot;that<BR>with prime property, we often get worse offers (by tender)<BR>than by negotiation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Feenstra said Telkom and its brokers had negotiated with<BR>some 40 clients over a period of more than a year, and the<BR>Newport directors' offer had been the best. &quot;We had the<BR>valuation, and we used that as our barometer ... At the stage<BR>we did the transaction, there is no doubt in my mind, we<BR>achieved a price independently determined to be above market<BR>value.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jordan's fears the property had passed from the original<BR>buyer for an extra profit -- which should have been Telkom's<BR>rather than a third party's -- appear to be unfounded,<BR>although based in fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town deeds office records show that in fact three<BR>legal entities now own shares in the property, whereas only<BR>one of them, the 406 Fairweather Trust, had made the deal<BR>with Telkom. But all three entities are owned by the<BR>directors of Newport, suggesting the passing on of the<BR>property had been a technicality and making it unlikely that<BR>further profit would have accrued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for Jordan's main apprehension, that the property had<BR>been sold for a song, perhaps only Moseneke's inquiry -- when<BR>he gets around to it -- will tell.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>September 1, 1995<BR>by Eddie Koch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Department of Environment Affairs is<BR>being pressed by the Australian government to help weaken a<BR>proposed international ban on shipments of hazardous<BR>materials from industrialised to non-industrialised<BR>countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The department has already been rocked by news that its<BR>consultants have allowed consignments of hazardous waste into<BR>the country, despite an official prohibition on toxic<BR>imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Confidential documents leaked to the Mail and Guardian<BR>show that an Australian delegation recently visited South<BR>Africa and met with officials in the departments of Foreign<BR>Affairs and Environment Affairs. Their mission was to discuss<BR>plans by member states of the Basel Convention to ban all<BR>movement of hazardous industrial wastes from OECD<BR>(industrialised) to non- OECD (industrialised) countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A report from the Australian delegation indicates their<BR>government is keen to establish support from South Africa for<BR>an initiative to weaken African support for the Basel ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We raised general issues in relation to the Basel<BR>Convention, in particular the ban decision. We said there<BR>should be no presumption that Australia would waive its<BR>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) rights (of free<BR>trade) as a result of membership of the Basel Convention,&quot;<BR>says the memorandum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We raised whether South Africa might be willing to play a<BR>regional role in raising awareness of Basel issues among<BR>African countries in the lead up to the third conference of<BR>parties (states which have agreed to adhere to the Basel<BR>convention) in September ... South African officials said<BR>they understood South Africa might be able to play an<BR>awareness-raising and general co-ordinating role within<BR>Africa. They said they would consider the idea further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Australian Financial Review reported this month that<BR>the Australian government is preparing to reverse its support<BR>for the proposed ban. Green Peace officials say Australian<BR>officials have also held talks with Malaysian and Indian<BR>officials ahead of next month's meeting in an effort to win<BR>support from some developing countries for resistance to a<BR>total ban. Australia's trade in hazardous materials is worth<BR>about R525-million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Basel convention is an international agreement that<BR>places controls on the movement of toxic and hazardous waste<BR>around the world. However, it has been criticised for not<BR>being tough enough. A meeting of member states, due to be<BR>held this month, is expected to come under strong pressure to<BR>include in the agreement a clause that prohibits all northChris Albertyn, representative of green pressure group<BR>south movement of wastes from the end of 1997.<BR>Earthlife Africa, told the M&amp;G his organisation has evidence<BR>that an Australian official had been seconded on a full-time<BR>basis to the Department of Foreign Affairs to help work on<BR>South Africa's waste import policy. Albertyn added that this<BR>official had pressured the Department of Environment Affairs<BR>not to allow non- government groups into the delegation that<BR>will attend the Basel meeting this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A foreign affairs spokesman confirmed that an Australian<BR>diplomat is working in Pretoria, but he denied that South<BR>Africa would allow its foreign policy to be decided by<BR>foreign countries.<BR>It is also clear that the United States government has<BR>identified South Africa as a strategic country in terms of<BR>African decisions about the toxic waste issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another secret document obtained by the M&amp;G -- this one a<BR>report from the US embassy in Pretoria to the State<BR>Department in Washington -- suggests recent controversies in<BR>South Africa over toxic waste could have negative<BR>consequences for US interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Massive shipments of mercury waste have come into South<BR>Africa from the US over the past few years, ostensibly for<BR>recycling purposes, and have caused serious ecological damage<BR>around the Thor Chemicals KwaZulu-Natal recycling plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, the government turned back a ship filled with<BR>500 tons of cupric arsenate from Finland. A US document<BR>reveals that this waste was created by US- based industries<BR>and shipped to Finland for recycling a few years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In another development, the Environmental Justice<BR>Networking Forum (EJNF), has announced that toxic-waste<BR>shipments are reaching South Africa without the government's<BR>knowledge. As a result, it will lead a private investigation<BR>to track such shipments,&quot; says the US embassy document. &quot;The<BR>EJNF is a forum of approximately 180 South African nonamong government circles because of its combative nature.&quot;<BR>governmental organisations (NGOs) ... The forum is unpopular</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy Environment Minister Bantu Holomisa last week<BR>announced an independent commission will investigate the<BR>toxic-waste scandal that has rocked his ministry and<BR>department.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The &quot;Truth and Reconciliation Commission&quot;<BR>is now unlikely to get under way until well into next year,<BR>according to Justice Minister Dullah Omar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omar has told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the &quot;process&quot; of<BR>selecting members of the commission would begin shortly and<BR>would &quot;hopefully&quot; be complete by the end of December.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission would then have to set up offices and<BR>decide how to tackle its three main tasks: uncovering &quot;the<BR>truth&quot; about human rights abuses in the apartheid era;<BR>granting amnesty to those who confess; and making reparation<BR>to victims and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not rushing into appointments, because of the<BR>importance of the commission,&quot; said Omar in an interview. It<BR>had been hoped that the commission would start hearings by<BR>October. In terms of enabling legislation it has 18 months to<BR>complete its task, extendible by six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister did not specify the process by which the<BR>commissioners would be chosen, but it is believed the plan is<BR>to create a broadly representative committee which will<BR>advise President Nelson Mandela on nominations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Answering protests by victims -- that they want &quot;justice&quot;<BR>rather than amnesties for the perpetrators of atrocities --<BR>Omar said all victims of crimes wanted vengeance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am required by the constitution to ensure there is a<BR>law-making provision for amnesty,&quot; he said.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Sudan Democratic Gazette (London)<BR>September 30, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LONDON - At the end of July, when former US President<BR>Jimmy Carter returned from his latest visit to Sudan having<BR>failed to secure a second extension to his Guinea Worm ceasethe Khartoum regime's international isolation than he was<BR>fire, it appeared as if her was more concerned with lifting<BR>with securing a genuine peace in the country. The Gazette has<BR>obtained a copy of a document in which Mr. Carter wrote that<BR>he was the middleman in trying to arrange new peace talks<BR>between Khartoum and the Sudan People's Liberation Army<BR>(SPLA). Talks which would have excluded the principles of<BR>Self-determination and Secularism from the outset and which<BR>would have negated all the positive work carried out by the<BR>Inter-governmental Authority for Drought and Development<BR>(IGADD) peace committee over the past three years. Strange as<BR>it may be to say so, Mr. Carter merely succeeded in<BR>demonstrating his naivete in this very long running Sudanese<BR>conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Guinea Worm cease-fire, although lasting for four<BR>months, was never much more than a propaganda charade. The<BR>National Islamic Front (NIF) regime has regularly violated<BR>the cease-fire, using it to reinforce and resupply its<BR>garrison towns in the South. Surprisingly then, it was the<BR>NIF regime which first recognised that the cease-fire could<BR>not continue in its original form as conceived by Mr. Carter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regime hoped to use Mr. Carter to persuade the SPLA to<BR>extend the cease-fire on new political terms. As the former<BR>US president has always harboured a desire to negotiate a<BR>political settlement of the Sudanese conflict, he was keen to<BR>pursue this avenue, perhaps not realising how the regime was<BR>using him, unless he was a willing candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Real Architect: The NIF regime has been the architect<BR>of the cease-fire since its inception. It will be remembered<BR>that Khartoum hoped to use Mr. Carter's influence to open<BR>doors in Washington, DC and that was the main reason for<BR>inviting him to Khartoum in March. A second reason concerned<BR>the abject failure of the regime's dry season offensive in<BR>the South. All manner of resources were released for the<BR>attack on the SPLA garrison at Nimule. The regime billed this<BR>as the decisive battle in the war which would shortly be over<BR>with the SPLA defeated. Nimule remained in SPLA hands and the<BR>regime's forces lost thousands of soldiers as well as<BR>equipment. By March the regime was desperate for a breathing<BR>space in the war so that it could regroup, reinforce and<BR>resupply the forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Guinea Worm cease-fire was the ideal solution to the<BR>regime's problems. It had the benefit of being humanitarian<BR>based, so the SPLA would hardly reject it, and Mr. Carter<BR>felt he was contributing to something positive. Also, there<BR>was no need to make any political concessions in the South.<BR>Injecting Politics: When Mr. Carter travelled to Khartoum in<BR>late July, he was confronted by Khartoum's change of tack<BR>over the cease-fire. With the NIF regime wanting to introduce<BR>the political aspects of the conflict into the cease-fire<BR>equation, Mr. Carter was optimistic that the SPLA would also<BR>want to discuss these matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Injecting Politics: When Mr. Carter travelled to Khartoum<BR>in late July, he was confronted by Khartoum's change of tack<BR>of the cease-fire. With the NIF regime wanting to introduce<BR>the political aspects f the conflict into the cease-fire<BR>equation, Mr. Carter was optimistic that the SPLA would also<BR>want to discuss these matters. The regime said it had two<BR>preconditions for the SPLA to fulfill before agreeing to a<BR>cease-fire, namely: that the SPLA should agree to fresh peace<BR>talks and also release seventy-two of the regime's soldiers<BR>who had been abducted at the beginning of the original ceaseWhether or not the former US president was aware of all<BR>fire in April.<BR>the facts surrounding these two preconditions before agreeing<BR>to present them to the SPLA is not known. However, if he was<BR>aware of them, then he had far too much confidence in his own<BR>diplomatic ability, if he sincerely believed that he could<BR>persuade the SPLA to accept them. The two preconditions set<BR>out by Khartoum were calculated to insult the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Firstly, the Khartoum regime walked out on the IGADD peace<BR>talks in September 1994 objecting to the Declaration of<BR>Principles (DOP) document and in particular the clauses on<BR>Self-determination and the role of Islam in the future<BR>politics of a democratic Sudan. The SPLA considers that the<BR>IGADD peace process is still continuing and has campaigned<BR>for the international community to put more pressure on the<BR>NIF regime to return to the talks. Khartoum's precondition<BR>implies that the regime is ready to make peace while the SPLA<BR>is not, which is a reversal of their positions at IGADD in<BR>reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, the demand for the release of the prisoners of<BR>war outside of any general exchange of POWs ought to have<BR>been recognised immediately as being unacceptable to the<BR>SPLA. It is well known that the regime takes no prisoners and<BR>executes any SPLA soldiers unlucky enough to be captured. The<BR>seventy-two POWs the regime was referring to were captured by<BR>the SPLA when they first violated the cease-fire at Lafon on<BR>1 April. The force was attempting to break through to Kapoeta<BR>and the SPLA, quite rightly, viewed such a large military<BR>movement as an act of war inconsistent with Mr. Carter's own<BR>cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SPLA Objection: A statement from the SPLA rejected the two<BR>preconditions and gave a very clear explanation as to why.<BR>The SPLA see the IGADD peace plan as the only workable option<BR>being tabled at present and those talks could reconvene<BR>immediately if the regime wished to participate seriously.<BR>The SPLA had agreed to the original cease-fire partly out of<BR>deference to Mr. Carter but mostly because of its<BR>humanitarian aspects and the facilitation of the immunization<BR>programmes for the eradication of Guinea Worm and River<BR>Blindness. The statement concluded by pointing out that the<BR>regime's forces had persistently violated the cease-fire<BR>throughout the four months but nothing had been done about<BR>this by those who sponsored it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite having announced the failure to extend the ceasehe thought both sides appeared to have developed an interest<BR>fire, Mr. Carter was hopeful that it would still hold because<BR>in maintaining it. It was not many days after Mr. Carter<BR>spoke when Khartoum launched its latest military offensive to<BR>take the border post of Kaya on the Sudanese-Uganda border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The manner and planning of the attack on Kaya, as reported<BR>in a separate story shows that Khartoum used the four months'<BR>so-called cease-fire lull to plan this attack and many more<BR>the regime said it is about to undertake. The swiftness with<BR>which Khartoum undertook to restart military operations at<BR>the end of the Guinea Worm cease-fire and only days after the<BR>former US president visited Khartoum, should show Mr. Carter<BR>how much respect the NIF regime has for his role. Dealing<BR>with this kind of credibility or international respect is one<BR>of Mr. Carter's real problems in all his efforts in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dry Season Fizzle: For six months from October 1994, the<BR>NIF regime has attempted to overrun Nimule. Using its own<BR>figures, more than 9,000 members of the Popular Defence Force<BR>(PDF) have been killed in the process and more than 15,000<BR>are wounded or in action. These loses can only be explained<BR>by the regime having fallen victim to its own empty<BR>propaganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Lieutenant General El Beshir announced in March that<BR>he was going to recruit a million volunteers to win the war<BR>in the South, this was merely bravado to deflect attention<BR>away from the mounting casualties in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recruits for the PDF from the North have tended to come<BR>from student supporters of the regime or those in the<BR>professions. They were encouraged to join up in the belief<BR>that the SPLA had been all but defeated. Their fervor for the<BR>jihad was further ignited by the stories that SPLA soldiers<BR>threw down their weapons and ran away when confronted by the<BR>true believers of the Islamic militias. Those lucky enough to<BR>go to the South during the 1994-95 offensive would be the<BR>final heroes in the war against the infidels. The propaganda<BR>also played on the belief that the balance of resources and<BR>numbers were in the regime's favour. The SPLA would be unable<BR>to match the regime's forces having neither anti-tank or<BR>anti-aircraft batteries nor external support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What the regime had not counted upon was that the SPLA did<BR>not act like a defeated force. The SPLA changed tactics,<BR>refused to take on the attackers conventionally, and in true<BR>guerrilla army fashion split up into highly mobile small<BR>units with strict instructions to target enemy personnel. The<BR>tactic was so successful that the NIF regime issued an order<BR>that the deaths would not be reported to relatives of the PDF<BR>soldiers in the North because of the negative effect this<BR>could have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Undermining IGADD: The Guinea Worm cease-fire was also<BR>intended to undermine the IGADD peace process. Despite the<BR>humanitarian nature of the cease-fire, the NIF regime was<BR>content that it had orchestrated something which could be<BR>perceived by the world to be a substantial step on the road<BR>to peace, without having to make any concessions. Throughout<BR>the four month period the regime's propaganda referred to the<BR>humanitarian aspects and made no linkage with the IGADD peace<BR>process. Even when the president of Kenya, Daniel arap Moi,<BR>became involved, Khartoum made no mention of his dual role as<BR>chairperson of the IGADD peace committee. Mr. Carter once or<BR>twice referred to Mr. Moi in his capacity as IGADD chairman<BR>but no great issue was made of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For his part, President Moi was always careful to insist<BR>that he was acting in his role of chairperson and not as the<BR>Kenyan leader. He was aware of how the NIF regime had<BR>attempted to use him to foster splits among the IGADD<BR>countries by letting it be known that Khartoum could deal<BR>with him on an individual basis, thus making the IGADD<BR>process redundant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Undermining Neighbours: Part of the NIF regime's efforts<BR>to undermine the security and sovereignty of Uganda and<BR>Eritrea were intended to cause a conflict with members of the<BR>IGADD peace committee on the grounds that they are in dispute<BR>with Khartoum. Such attempts were never likely to succeed<BR>because all the committee members made it plain from the<BR>outset that they had a vested interest in finding a peaceful<BR>solution to the Sudanese conflict. As that became a part of<BR>their national interests, it was naive of Khartoum to believe<BR>that these states would trade off one part of their national<BR>interests against another. The regime's actions have merely<BR>made Uganda and Eritrea more determined to broker a peace in<BR>Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attempt to suggest that peace talks could be held<BR>under IGADD's auspices but not based on the Declaration of<BR>Principles was another misguided ploy to thwart the IGADD<BR>process. Fortunately, the SPLA has been resolute in its<BR>response to these games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carter's Real Agenda: All the evidence suggests that the<BR>former US president has been less that honest in hi dealings<BR>with the SPLA. His real intention appears to have been to<BR>lift the regional and international isolation of the Khartoum<BR>regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After being rushed into a quick visit of the regime's<BR>garrison town of Juba, Mr. Carter declared himself well<BR>satisfied that the South enjoyed considerable exemption from<BR>the Islamic Sharia law being applied in the North. He<BR>believed that such an exemption could be the basis of a<BR>political settlement. In a letter to the former Italian<BR>ambassador who is currently the United Nation's envoy to<BR>Sudan on humanitarian matters, Mr. Carter stated that the<BR>Declaration of Principles was unhelpful to the peace process,<BR>especially the clauses on Self-Determination and Secularism.<BR>These would need to be dropped for the process to continue.<BR>In other words, the former US president wishes to see the NIF<BR>regime rewarded at the peace table with what they had been<BR>unable to achieve on the battlefield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bad Timing: Mr. Carter's timing has been unfortunate. It<BR>is inconceivable that the South through the SPLA or its other<BR>representatives would give up all the political gains<BR>achieved in recent years. For the NIF regime to continue in<BR>power would be to add insult and suffering endured by the<BR>Southern people at its hands. It is in the best interests of<BR>the Southern people that a settlement to the conflict is<BR>arrived at with the Sudanese opposition forces. These forces<BR>have finally recognised the right of Self-determination as<BR>the basis for consolidating the future unity of the country,<BR>or for secession, and the only way forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bias for the Regime: On his return from the region, Mr.<BR>Carter's bias for the NIF regime became even more apparent.<BR>In his letter to the United Nations secretary general's<BR>special envoy on humanitarian affairs, Mr. Vievi Traxler, he<BR>asked him to pursue certain matters on Khartoum's behalf. The<BR>letter outlined how Mr. Carter had tried to circumvent the<BR>IGADD Declaration of Principles. It also reiterates his<BR>belief that there is religious freedom in the South, based on<BR>his brief visit to Juba. It is surprising that anyone could<BR>make such clear-cut conclusions when embarking on a carefully<BR>scheduled official visit, and being taken to the places the<BR>regime wanted him to see. The Southern people who have been<BR>persecuted because of their religion, and some even enslaved,<BR>are hardly likely to agree with Mr. Carter at all!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NDA Factor: The re-emergence of the National<BR>Democratic Alliance (NDA) as a serious political force<BR>following its conference in Asmara in June, is certainly an<BR>unwelcome development for the regime. The NDA has accepted<BR>the right of all the people of Sudan to Self-determination<BR>and now has an extensive agenda for the future once the NIF<BR>has been overthrown. In addition, the NDA has been specific<BR>about how it intends to bring about that overthrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khartoum's reaction has been predictable, attacking the<BR>agenda as intending to undermine Islam. Despite the rhetoric,<BR>the regime knows that it can ill afford to ignore the NDA's<BR>agenda without doing something concrete to counter it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attempt to get the SPLA to peace talks that do not<BR>involve Self-determination and Secularism was just one ploy<BR>to counter the NDA. The regime has yet to recognise that the<BR>Asmara conference has brought the opposition forces together<BR>and that the SPLA has little room to negotiate outside the<BR>Asmara agenda. To do otherwise would be top compromise on the<BR>important issues at the base of the Sudanese conflict. A fact<BR>which the Asmara conference has settled once and for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ignoring the Inevitable: The only way out for the regime<BR>now would be to accept that the issues decided at Asmara are<BR>indeed the way forward for Sudan. In the unlikely<BR>circumstances of this happening, the NDA would need to<BR>consider if it wanted to accept a compromise with the NIF<BR>regime, considering all the crimes against the Sudanese<BR>people it has committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of all the good intentions of people like Mr.<BR>Carter, who would like to save the NIF regime, the die of<BR>confrontation between it and the rest of Sudan and its<BR>neighbours has been cast. All pointers indicate that it is<BR>now the beginning of the end for the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gazette has no doubt of the personal good will Mr.<BR>Carter has for the people of Sudan, but is less confident in<BR>his political understanding of the complexities of the<BR>Sudanese situation. Perhaps it is time for him to end his<BR>involvement and to move on to pastures new.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>August 31, 1995<BR>by Nancy Wanjiku</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - The latest registration of the Regional<BR>Fellowship of Churches of Kenya (RFCK) may be swept aside as<BR>mere emergence of a splinter group from the main<BR>organisation. But a keen observer will appreciate the<BR>political leanings presented by such a move. Will the<BR>National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK), a long-standing<BR>critic of the government of the day be cowed by the<BR>establishment of a rival church body?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ever since a 1986 Pastoral conference organised by the<BR>National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) questioned the<BR>queue-voting system then adopted by the ruling Kenya African<BR>National Union (KANU) party, the Church and state have not<BR>missed issues to disagree about. The state has continually<BR>employed the tactic of playing one church against the other<BR>in a bid to weaken the politically active churches. The<BR>latest of these efforts was in the registration of the<BR>Regional Fellowship of Churches of Kenya (RFCK) on July 28,<BR>1995, two months after the NCCK called for the trimming of<BR>Presidential powers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The interim General Secretary of the new body, the Rev.<BR>John Wycliffe Wanga, a former employee of the NCCK, says the<BR>aim of establishing RFCK is to &quot;work closely with the<BR>government and keep NCCK on its toes.&quot; But the Rev. Mutava<BR>Musyimi, General Secretary of the NCCK has been quoted<BR>saying, &quot;We are not worried about the new body. Our main<BR>concern is the tone of some of the statements the officials<BR>of the new Christian body are currently making. It is our<BR>strong belief that such a new body should target at<BR>challenging us positively. There is too much yet to be<BR>accomplished in our pastoral mission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the past decade, during which NCCK has been<BR>particularly visible on the social political sphere,<BR>accusations labeled against church leaders especially by<BR>government officials claim that the clergy are serving<BR>&quot;foreign masters&quot;. Critics have cautioned the clergy against<BR>mixing politics with spiritual matters because by so doing<BR>they would be serving both God and mammon. And there have<BR>been many calls for the de registration of NCCK including one<BR>in 1992 by President Daniel arap Moi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the church leaders are not without defence. They quote<BR>the words of Kenya's first President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta who<BR>challenged them: &quot;If we go wrong and you keep quiet, one day<BR>you may have to answer for our mistakes. The nation today<BR>needs a conscience and you (the church) are that<BR>conscience....&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The clergy argue that when they feed the hungry they must<BR>also ask why there is hunger. And that the NCCK as a<BR>conciliatory non-partisan body seeks to obey the Lord's call<BR>to &quot;come let us reason together&quot; and help establish a<BR>peaceful democratic Kenya where all can enjoy a sense of<BR>security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the 1986 conference at which the NCCK strongly<BR>opposed the line-up-behind-the-candidate ballot method, the<BR>clergy also called for a referendum to discuss constitutional<BR>amendments. The then Archbishop of the Church of the Province<BR>of Kenya (CPK) Manasses Kuria described the system as<BR>unchristian, undemocratic and embarrassing. Catholic Bishop<BR>Ndingi Mwana a' Nzeki said the voting system created schisms<BR>within the Church while outspoken clergy, the late Anglican<BR>Bishop Alexander Muge said, in a one party state the Church<BR>must give a voice to the voiceless. The late Bishop, a strong<BR>critic of the government of the day, emphasised that the role<BR>of the church is to stand up against the pressure of<BR>totalitarianism. Soon a chorus of insults by proNicholas Biwott calling for all churches that did not support<BR>establishment figures began with the then Energy Minister<BR>the NCCK move to leave the council.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>August 31, g1995<BR>by Wafula John and Santino Makur Rot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - As over 30,000 women meet in Beijing for the<BR>Fourth United Nations World Conference between August 30 and<BR>October 15, Africa's track record shows that women on the<BR>continent still lack resources, authority, decision making<BR>powers, are over-worked, underpaid and not appreciated for<BR>their worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, women in Africa receive 30 to 40 per cent less pay<BR>than men for the same workload according to a UN report.<BR>Besides, much of their daily work is without any remuneration<BR>and the value of their household labour goes unrecorded.<BR>Furthermore about 35 per cent of all African households are<BR>supported by women. According to a report, &quot;Women and Men in<BR>East, Central and Southern Africa, Facts and Figures,&quot;<BR>prepared by the Regional Gender Statistics Project, Nairobi,<BR>48 per cent of households in Botswana, 40 per cent in<BR>Swaziland and 39 per cent in Kenya were headed by women by<BR>1990.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The document asserts that the &quot;participation rates in<BR>employment&quot; in countries studied, &quot;are higher for men than<BR>for women.&quot; It says; &quot;The high employment rates for men imply<BR>that women are not either preferred in the formal job market<BR>or are engaged in informal employment more so within the<BR>households.&quot; According to the report, unemployment rates are<BR>higher for women in urban areas. In Zambia and Kenya, for<BR>example, the urban unemployment rate among women is 22 per<BR>cent compared to 12 per cent among men. Worse still, economic<BR>activities in the urban areas are male dominated with men's<BR>participation soaring as high as 82 per cent while that of<BR>women often plunges as low as 24 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact blatant discrimination against women in Africa is<BR>evident through the three sectors of most countries'<BR>economies - public, private and parastatal. Women are<BR>generally less employed compared to men, with Zambia<BR>employing a meager 11 per cent of them in the public and<BR>parastatal sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A general trend in African countries is that as one moves<BR>up the ladder of education the level of education gets lower<BR>for women as it gets higher for men. In Kenya, the level of<BR>education for women gradually falls from 48 per cent in<BR>primary school education to a mere 28 per cent in higher<BR>education. What worsens the situation in Africa is the<BR>absence of women in major decision making roles. With hardly<BR>any government ministers to talk of, a handful of Members of<BR>Parliament (MPs), coupled with an acute shortage of civic<BR>leaders, women are disadvantaged in matters of decision<BR>making and policy implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even in local administration, which is vital as it deals<BR>with the lower echelons of decision making and the<BR>influencing of people at the grassroots level, women are<BR>grossly misrepresented. Zimbabwe, for example, has only 4 per<BR>cent of women mayors, a scenario that repeats itself in<BR>several African countries. With the rural African woman<BR>shouldering the burden of food production and receiving<BR>meager returns, often through the man, there is need to<BR>address her problems and look for strategies to alleviate her<BR>suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Will Beijing offer a change of direction in the lives of<BR>African women? A culmination of the process that began with<BR>national preparations, at the Beijing conference will<BR>evaluate progress towards the empowerment of women;<BR>politically, economically and socially, since the &quot;Nairobi<BR>Forward-Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women up to<BR>the year 2000&quot; were adopted in the 1985 conference in the<BR>Kenyan capital.<BR>Participating African states have prepared a document<BR>detailing critical areas of concern for African women. The<BR>document, The African Platform for Action, was adopted by 52<BR>participating member states during the Fifth African Regional<BR>Conference on Women held in Dakar, Senegal from November 16<BR>to 23 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among its 11 areas of concern are: economic empowerment<BR>and poverty reduction among women, violence against women,<BR>women in education and training, the girl-child, and women<BR>political empowerment and decision making. Other crucial<BR>areas covered at Dakar included property rights, land rights,<BR>inheritance and asset holdings. African delegates are<BR>lobbying for these issues to be included in a global plan of<BR>action which will be adopted by the Beijing conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To date, three UN world conferences on women have been<BR>held. The first, in Mexico City (1975) during the<BR>international women's year adopted a plan of action that led<BR>to the declaration by the UN General Assembly, of the<BR>following 10 years as the UN decade for women. In 1979, the<BR>General Assembly adopted the convention on the elimination of<BR>all forms of discrimination against women to which 133 states<BR>are signatories. The second conference held in Copenhagen,<BR>Denmark (1980), adopted a programme of action for the second<BR>half of the decade for women with emphasis on education,<BR>employment and health. The third world conference, in Nairobi<BR>(1985), reviewed the achievements made and obstacles<BR>encountered during the decade for women and adopted the<BR>famous &quot;Nairobi Forward-looking strategies.&quot; The strategies<BR>provided a framework for action at the national, regional,<BR>and international levels. The forward-looking strategies were<BR>evaluated by the UN commission on the status of women. It<BR>revealed that while there was greater consciousness and<BR>sensitivity towards issues affecting women, there was loss of<BR>momentum in implementation of the strategies. The fourth<BR>conference attempts to rekindle this momentum while focussing<BR>on other issues like violence against women, sexual<BR>harassment and the girl-child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, in the 20 years since the inception of the UN<BR>conference on women, certain undeniable advances have been<BR>made, observers say. Women are now entering the labour market<BR>in unprecedented numbers and pursuing greater roles in all<BR>sectors of public life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some observers insist that governments have adopted major<BR>legislations which promise women equal opportunities,<BR>treatment and respect for their rights, that women are<BR>increasingly gaining access to proper health care, and civil<BR>justice. What is more, they say, women themselves have become<BR>more aware of their rights hence are mobilising to fight<BR>discrimination and persistent injustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless some observers argue that the problems faced<BR>by African women would best be solved at home. But Rosemary<BR>A. Nandi, a Kenyan teacher counters such critics. &quot; A Beijing<BR>enthusiast&quot;, she says, &quot;it is important that African women<BR>meet others both for exposure and to hear how other women are<BR>solving their own problems. It is a forum for assessing each<BR>other's strengths and weaknesses,&quot; Whether the Beijing<BR>conference will be any different from the previous three,<BR>particularly the Nairobi one, is a great source of concern<BR>for most Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a question we have been asking ourselves too,&quot; says<BR>Rose Arungu-Oiende, UN advisor and Liaison Officer for<BR>Africa. &quot;Indeed Beijing is not going to be anything that the<BR>Nairobi conference was not, or say anything that Nairobi did<BR>not say.&quot; &quot;But there is one thing it will do,&quot; she says<BR>confidently. &quot;Unlike the Nairobi conference which identified<BR>problems and strategies, but did not say how key players<BR>could achieve strategies, Beijing will tell us of<BR>implementation plans that are achievable,&quot; she concluded. The<BR>official adds that the Beijing document has a resource<BR>section which discusses what is required for the<BR>implementation of the strategies. The reality of attending<BR>the Beijing meeting is not just in participation but in the<BR>impact the forum will have on individual lives in the long<BR>run. And it is how those policies will be implemented by<BR>individual governments, NGO's and communities that will<BR>matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever recommendations Beijing will make, these will<BR>have to come to terms with the African reality, hence there<BR>is more need to sensitize the African man and community as a<BR>whole on the benefits to be accrued with the empowering of<BR>women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN Economic Commission for Africa recognises the<BR>difficulties of implementing internationally agreed upon<BR>policies from its experiences with the implementation of the<BR>Nairobi Forward-looking strategies, whose failures it<BR>attributes to &quot;the absence of appropriate structures for<BR>undertaking implementation activities and the failures to<BR>identify the sources of necessary resources.&quot; Whether<BR>&quot;appropriate structures&quot; and resources will be available<BR>after Beijing remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the UN also recognises that: &quot;the effectiveness<BR>of these machineries depends on strong political will, such<BR>political will should lead to giving the machinery an<BR>institutional location which will allow it to have a direct<BR>effect on government policy, have access to information, and<BR>reach out to grass roots organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Will African governments take up this challenge after<BR>Beijing? Non-Governmental organisations too have a key role<BR>to play through their programmes. They have to take a more<BR>dynamic approach to translate the UN document into meaningful<BR>guidelines. Above all, the ordinary African woman will play a<BR>leading role by impressing upon the generally male-dominated<BR>community her great worth. However, the positive recognition<BR>of the African woman from a variety of shackles forged over<BR>ages by a male dominated society will not come as a result of<BR>women representatives solely fighting it out on their own.<BR>Such achievements would only be reached through communal<BR>understanding. The awareness that prejudices, domination,<BR>subjugation, and exploitation, be they out of racial,<BR>religious or gender bias, are demeaning and work against<BR>societal progress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2027 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>August 31, 1995<BR>by Alex Bagenda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - Providing good education is not always<BR>synonymous with schooling. The kind of family a child grows<BR>up in is crucial to the general well being of the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talk of education and most minds will focus on the school<BR>as the only place where a child must be introduced to<BR>education, with the teachers as the key players in such a<BR>task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But more crucial to a child, even before he/she starts<BR>schooling is the role a family plays in the 0-5 year stage of<BR>life. In a recent sub-regional workshop for policy makers in<BR>Africa on approaches to Early Childhood Care and Education<BR>(ECCE) held in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, the importance<BR>of the family was highlighted because of the key role this<BR>unit plays in safeguarding and enhancing the rights and<BR>welfare of the child. At the meeting organised by the United<BR>Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation<BR>(UNESCO), Mrs Kisamba Mugerwa, Senior Lecturer in the<BR>Department of Sociology at Uganda's Makerere University told<BR>participants from Eastern and Southern Africa that the family<BR>must remain a strong agent of socialisation for the African<BR>child.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Its contribution to early childhood care and development<BR>cannot be under-estimated. The family fulfills varying but<BR>always important responsibilities of ensuring that the<BR>children of the preceding generation are equipped with<BR>adequate necessary skills to meet the challenges in modern<BR>society,&quot; she said. It is within the family system that a<BR>child is first provided with warmth, security, shelter, food,<BR>clothing, guidance, and identity which are basic needs<BR>essential for proper human development. &quot;The proper<BR>development of a child, as we are reliably informed by<BR>psychologists is influenced by how those basic needs are<BR>adequately met during one's childhood and the child's<BR>relationship with the environment. Without these provisions,<BR>the early childhood development of a child can easily be<BR>jeopardised,&quot; noted Mugerwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the current trend in Uganda paints a gloomy picture.<BR>Many families are headed by children under 18 partly as a<BR>result of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)<BR>pandemic which has claimed the lives of both parents. In such<BR>cases, the early childhood development of surviving children<BR>has been left in the hands of guardians and young siblings<BR>who are ill prepared to handle the parental functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another aspect affecting the strength of the family today<BR>in Uganda is increasing unemployment and retrenchment as a<BR>result of economic restructuring activities currently being<BR>effected. Problems resulting from restructuring are going to<BR>continue to affect the functions of the family, in that an<BR>increasing number of people may not be able to provide the<BR>essential basic needs for the development of their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For those who are employed the conditions of work, rising<BR>costs of essential commodities and threats of unemployment or<BR>retrenchment may leave the family in a position where it is<BR>unable to deal with provision of basic needs of the<BR>children,&quot; pointed out the Makerere lecturer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rebecca Nyonyintono, a consulting sociologist also<BR>emphasised the importance of the family in early childhood<BR>education. &quot;The family should be accorded the necessary<BR>protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its<BR>responsibility within the community. The family atmosphere<BR>must be right in order for the family to be able to meet its<BR>key responsibility,&quot; she noted. Unfortunately in Africa, much<BR>as parents say they love their children, discipline and<BR>authority override the demonstration of real love, parental<BR>understanding, what the child wants to do and why and his/her<BR>point of view in a decision which must be taken. Said Dr.<BR>Nyonyintono, &quot;We have none or little skills in understanding<BR>children, that is why we resort to tough discipline,<BR>manipulation and downright cruelty and negligence of<BR>children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of our African settings do not encourage open<BR>demonstration of emotions including love, for fear of<BR>spoiling the child. Dr. Nyonyintono exemplified loving a<BR>child as being there for the child, parenting the child,<BR>guiding the child into responsible life, accepting the child<BR>as she/he is, and taking the child's opinions seriously.<BR>&quot;This is the essence of affirming the rights and welfare of<BR>the child,&quot; she noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations convention on the rights of the child<BR>and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) charter on the<BR>rights and welfare of the child clearly state that &quot;the child<BR>should be fully prepared to live an individual life in<BR>society and brought up in the spirit of the ideals proclaimed<BR>in the charter and in particular in the spirit of peace,<BR>dignity, tolerance, freedom, equality and solidarity,&quot;<BR>observed Nyonyintono. She went on to say that these values<BR>can be inculcated in children. The UN convention on the<BR>rights of the child states that it is &quot;by reason of physical<BR>and mental immaturity&quot; that the child needs special<BR>safeguards and care including appropriate legal protection<BR>before as well as after birth. The convention and the OAU<BR>Charter spell out the safeguards, provisions for care and<BR>legal framework for protection of the rights of the child<BR>including before birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Nyonyintono noted that malnourished children and<BR>under-nourished adults especially pregnant women undermine<BR>the quality of life of the child before birth. &quot;The right of<BR>the child before birth is therefore a broad concept covering<BR>the right to quality of life across the generations,&quot; she<BR>said. The UN convention and the OAU charter are meant to<BR>ensure that every child realises the right to reach full<BR>physical and mental maturation before being saddled with<BR>adult responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, many adults left to their own whims and fancies<BR>would deny children the right to proper maturation before<BR>involving them into adult activities and responsibilities.<BR>Mere children care for their younger siblings because they<BR>are too many of them, too frequent, too early, too long in<BR>the family and the parents must rely on their children to<BR>raise one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Children, sometimes below the age of 14, are married off<BR>or seduced by adults to become lovers or wives and<BR>consequently parents,&quot; noted Nyonyintono. In Uganda, some<BR>people base decisions about girls' marriage or involvement in<BR>sexual activity on mere puberty because puberty is mistaken<BR>for physical and mental maturity. &quot;The social indicators of<BR>this country are a clear testimony to the price we are paying<BR>for failure to let children reach physical and mental<BR>maturity before involving them in adult activities and<BR>responsibilities. In other words we are still very far from<BR>protecting the rights and welfare of our children,&quot; the<BR>sociologist lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the important role played by the mother in early<BR>childhood education, Kisamba Mugerwa expressed concern about<BR>the lack of traditional support mothers used to enjoy in the<BR>past. &quot;The mother enjoyed the support of other women in the<BR>household and the community at large. The community assisted<BR>in passing on the cultural practices, the social behaviour<BR>required, the rites, the obligations and expectations of<BR>society during various ceremonies,&quot; she noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, mothers get very little support if any from the<BR>community, a factor that has been made worse by working<BR>mothers who must stay away from their children mostly during<BR>the day. In many cases in Uganda for instance, some children<BR>who would otherwise be attending school have major<BR>responsibilities to care for young siblings or work in the<BR>field. In other cases, children are victims of frustration,<BR>blackmail or ill-treatment by family members, yet a family<BR>should provide security right from early childhood. &quot;A child<BR>needs to live in a stable environment with continuing<BR>affection and fairly well ordered living conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But with the changing roles of the family, it is becoming<BR>increasingly difficult for children to receive adequate<BR>protection from this unit as was the case in traditional<BR>societies. Therefore the need to find an institution which<BR>would provide assistance to those children who may find<BR>themselves in such a predicament might help those in need,&quot;<BR>Mugerwa observed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>August 31, 1995<BR>by Sam Gonza</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANTANANARIVO - Towards the end of July, Madagascar's Head<BR>of State, President Albert Zafy, alarmed the Indian Ocean<BR>island nation, one of the poorest countries in the world,<BR>with his announcement that weapons were being smuggled into<BR>the country with the possible intention of causing an<BR>insurrection. It was the culmination of a highly damaging<BR>stand-off with his Prime Minister, Francisque Ravony, that<BR>has threatened to split the Armed Forces and the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Francisque Ravony, the reformist Prime Minister of the<BR>Indian Ocean island nation of Madagascar has agreed to step<BR>down in mid-September after the damaging stand-off between<BR>him and the Head of State, President Albert Zafy, threatened<BR>to drag sections of the Armed Forces into different camps<BR>with the potential to destroy all democratic gains made<BR>during the past five years. Observers link his offer to quit<BR>office to reconciliation and mediation by the Christian<BR>Council of Churches in Madagascar, FFKM, which organised a<BR>series of meetings between the two leaders. The efforts<BR>appear to have opened up Ravony's eyes to the potentially<BR>explosive situation in the impoverished nation of seven<BR>million people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current stand-off started in June when Zafy brought<BR>into the open simmering suspicions and disagreement between<BR>the President and the Premier, calling the National Assemblythere was irrevocable bad blood between them, Zafy announced<BR>appointed Ravony a liar, hypocrite and corrupt man. Saying<BR>he was calling a referendum on September 17 to ask the<BR>Malagasy people to decide whether the President or the<BR>National Assembly should constitutionally be empowered to<BR>appoint the Prime Minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ravony narrowly defeated a motion of censure against him<BR>on July 12. The Prime Minister says he will step down<BR>regardless of the referendum's outcome. As their disagreement<BR>reached a stalemate, Zafy went on national radio on July 26<BR>to claim that weapons were being smuggled into Madagascar.<BR>Blaming unnamed foreign elements, he linked the increased<BR>robberies, banditry, murders and kidnappings to the purported<BR>smuggled weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But before the motion of censure against him was sorted<BR>out in his favour, Ravony made his point very clear -- if the<BR>President made it impossible for the government to function,<BR>then the Premier would appoint a new one and include the<BR>military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Ravony's threat to involve the military in the<BR>government disturbed many people as it evoked memories of a<BR>similar state of affairs during the rule of President<BR>Phillibert Tsiranana in 1972. Then, the army refused to quit,<BR>and it required the concerted effort and sacrifice of the<BR>Malagasy people which included a great loss of life to<BR>dislodge them in the early 1990s. It so happened that in<BR>1972, in the midst of severe economic difficulties partly<BR>caused by poor international prices for one of the main<BR>crops, vanilla, peasants in Tulear Province revolted and the<BR>country's students soon joined the civil disobedience<BR>campaign. Tsiranana, who had ruled Madagascar since<BR>independence in 1960, acknowledged his inability to rule and<BR>turned over the government to Major General Gabriel<BR>Ramanantsoa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ravony's critics point out that as a member of one of the<BR>numerous pro-democracy groups whose concerted efforts removed<BR>the military leadership of Commander Didier Ratsiraka, the<BR>successor of two military regimes, the premier, should never<BR>have contemplated such a naive solution to his stand-off with<BR>Zafy. In fact Didier Ratsiraka's supporters still play a role<BR>in Madagascar's politics under the umbrella of the National<BR>Council of Federalist Groupings. In March, Ratsiraka's<BR>supporters joined a faction in Parliament called Ralaimongo<BR>Active Forces in organising a demonstration against the<BR>government. They were demanding the release from custody of<BR>two opposition personalities who had announced the formation<BR>of &quot;a parallel government&quot; for Madagascar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ravony's task as Prime Minister has not been an easy one<BR>in the poverty stricken nation. Apparently in the hope of<BR>retrieving the economy from the abyss, Madagascar under<BR>Ravony has continued to embrace World Bank/International<BR>Monetary Fund (IMF) guidelines which go back to the time when<BR>Ratsiraka assumed power 15 years ago. The ordinary people of<BR>Madagascar have reaped little from IMF programmes. Internal<BR>restlessness has come in the wake of dwindling incomes, high<BR>food prices, rampant epidemics like malaria in some parts of<BR>Madagascar, urban crime and banditry and a stagnant job<BR>market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gross National Product (GNP) is less than US dollars<BR>200. The country is massively indebted, estimated at US<BR>dollars 5,000 million. When the Malagasy franc was floated in<BR>May last year at the insistence of the IMF, the currency<BR>collapsed overnight sending prices of necessities spiraling.<BR>The floatation was done one month after a devastating series<BR>of hurricanes hit the island. Leading cash crops are coffee,<BR>cloves and vanilla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank wants reforms in the state controlled<BR>vanilla industry. Investors are now eyeing Madagascar's<BR>pristine forests, home to unique fauna and flora. One such<BR>scheme is already quite advanced and involves the Rio Tinto<BR>Zinc Corp, a Canadian firm which is seeking concessions for<BR>huge tracts of forests to mine a metal used in the aircraft<BR>industry, titanium, from the coastal sands in the south east<BR>of Madagascar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics like the ecology promoting Friends of the Earth,<BR>warn that such schemes will set a precedent for the<BR>destruction of a larger area of Madagascan forests. Friends<BR>of the Earth's field director in Madagascar, Andrew Lees,<BR>lived in a section of the contested forest. He was found dead<BR>last year in mysterious circumstances.<BR>It is estimated that the Rio Tinto deal would earn Madagascar<BR>at least US dollars 40 million per annum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like Zafy, the majority in the Assembly, including Speaker<BR>Rev. Richard Andriamanjato, are opposed to Ravony's undiluted<BR>support for World Bank programmes. Both Zafy and<BR>Andriamanjato are reported to be shopping around for<BR>commercial loans as an alternative to those from the Bank.<BR>Observers agree that should Ravony quit as anticipated come<BR>mid- September, whoever replaces him will have no choice but<BR>to go along with the World Bank prescriptions. It is unlikely<BR>that Zafy and his key backers in the Cabinet will be able to<BR>bring into Madagascar's shaky economy a level of investment<BR>that will boost the country's overall recovery process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>August 31, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GENEVA - The Action by Churches Together (ACT), an<BR>ecumenical organisation comprising the Lutheran World<BR>Federation (LWF), the World Council of Churches (WCC) and<BR>more than 40 major related relief agencies has sent out an<BR>urgent appeal for nearly US dollars 3 million to assist<BR>Rwandese and Burundian refugees in Zaire. The US dollar 2.9<BR>million appeal by ACT comes in the wake of a recent ultimatum<BR>by Zairean authorities' that all Rwandese and Burundian<BR>refugees &quot;must leave the country before December 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a press conference here on August 29, Zairean Prime<BR>Minister, Kengo wa Dondo said &quot;repatriation must be en masse,<BR>without interruption and end by December 31, 1995 at the<BR>latest. In case repatriation is delayed beyond December 31,<BR>1995, Zaire reserves the right to make the refugees leave its<BR>territory.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACT which was constituted last year to respond to the<BR>world's growing emergency crises, said most of the funds were<BR>intended for food and non-food items. Purchases listed under<BR>non-food items include plastic sheeting, ropes, blankets,<BR>kitchen sets, jerricans and soaps. &quot;But in order to meet the<BR>most critical needs, ACT has agreed to allocate US dollars<BR>300,000 from unearmarked funds from the Church World Actionof plastic shelter materials,&quot; ACT stressed in its appeal.<BR>Rwanda (CWA-R) Advent Appeal towards the purchase and airlift</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ecumenical group also expressed concern that &quot;there is<BR>very little in Rwanda for the refugees when they arrive in<BR>this uncertain and desperate state&quot; and hoped that the funds<BR>appeal would raise the targeted amount. The appeal was<BR>jointly signed by the director of the World Council of<BR>Churches (WCC), Unit IV, Rev. Myra Blyth and Rev. Rudolf<BR>Hinz, director of the Lutheran World Federation/World Service<BR>(LWF/WS)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaire's threat against Rwandese and Burundian refugees,<BR>began on August 19. The authorities first used &quot;force&quot; to<BR>effect the operation, but later stopped after the United<BR>Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) among other<BR>international organisations and governments, complained about<BR>the act. But by the time the UN and others intervened, some<BR>independent statistics indicated that close to 15,000<BR>refugees had already been forcibly expelled from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Geneva meeting between Zairean Prime Minister Kengo<BR>wa Dondo and the UNHCR boss, Mrs. Sadako Ogata, the UN head<BR>refused to accept fixed, numerical targets for a programme<BR>which she said, remained voluntary.<BR>Zaire is said to be hosting one of the highest numbers of<BR>refugees, mainly Rwandese and Burundian most of whom fled<BR>their countries following ethnic killings early last year. By<BR>the time of going to press there were reports of a heavy flow<BR>of refugees from Zaire with some NGOs reportedly shifting<BR>their operations from inside Zaire to Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A recent Report of the International Council for Voluntary<BR>Agencies (ICVA) on the refugee crisis in Zaire says the<BR>central African state hosts more than one million of the 1.8<BR>million Rwandese refugees in the Great Lakes region. It also<BR>hosts some 72,000 of the 180,000 Burundi refugees in central<BR>Africa. The ICVA report says, Zaire has already expelled<BR>between 15,000 and 20,000 refugees and &quot;there is no reason to<BR>believe the situation will change.&quot; Saying that political<BR>relations between Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi have<BR>deteriorated, the ICVA report explains that &quot;the decision<BR>taken by the UN Security Council on August 16 to lift the<BR>arms embargo on Rwanda has further complicated the already<BR>fragile political situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The expulsion of Rwandese and Burundian refugees from<BR>Zaire comes barely a month since the All Africa Conference of<BR>Churches (AACC) made a pastoral visit to both countries.<BR>During the visit, AACC emphasised the need for both churches<BR>and non- church bodies to work hand-in-hand towards the<BR>realisation of true peace and reconciliation among the<BR>suffering Rwandese and Burundians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AACC delegation was led by the organisation's<BR>President, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu and its<BR>General Secretary, Rev. Jose Chipenda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FREETOWN - Relief agencies in Sierra Leone say food<BR>shortages have reached crisis proportion in several parts of<BR>the country, with about 300 people reported dead in the last<BR>one week or so as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a spokesman of Capt. Valentine Strasser's government<BR>has denied reports of any deaths resulting from starvation.<BR>Sierra Leone has been experiencing civil war since early<BR>1991.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agencies maintain that about 300 displaced people<BR>starved to death in parts of the country which have been cut<BR>off from relief supplies and that many more people were dying<BR>every day. They say continued fighting between government<BR>troops and those of the rebel Revolutionary United Front<BR>(RUF) has severely disrupted food distribution, adding that<BR>the hardest hit are the towns of Kenema and Bo, in the east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chairman of a committee for displaced people, Mr.<BR>Ismail Foday, told reporters earlier that the deaths occurred<BR>near the eastern town of Kenema, 240 kilometres east of the<BR>capital, Freetown, and two other towns further east, Segbwema<BR>and Daru. Reports quote Foday as saying: &quot;The entire region<BR>will virtually become empty in a very short while if<BR>something is not done quickly.&quot; But a government spokesman,<BR>Dr. Keith Kamara, denied reports that food shortages have<BR>reached crisis levels in parts of the country, and said no<BR>one has died of hunger in Kenema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he conceded in a British Broadcasting Corporation<BR>(BBC) interview that children were dying of cholera in the<BR>region. Relief officials are quoted as saying there is enough<BR>food in the West African country to feed the starving<BR>population, but continuing rebel ambushes on major roads were<BR>keeping many war-affected areas cut off from relief supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sierra Leone Red Cross was reported last July as<BR>saying that at least 76 people had died of hunger around the<BR>besieged town of Bo, 170 kilometres east of Freetown. It<BR>blamed the deaths on the destruction of rice and manioc<BR>fields by RUF rebels. In recent months, the Sierra Leone<BR>army, backed by troops from Nigeria, Guinea, and mercenaries<BR>from the South African firm, Executive Outcomes, has claimed<BR>a string of victories against the rebels. Troops are said to<BR>have dislodged the rebels from key positions and captured<BR>several of their bases from the far north to the southeast.<BR>But those efforts have not prevented Foday Sankoh's rebels<BR>from mounting daring raids and ambushes on food convoys.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>August 31, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - Kenya's oldest mass circulation daily the East<BR>African Standard, previously owned by Lonrho, has been sold<BR>to new investors.<BR>However, to whom, at what cost and how the payments are going<BR>to be made are matters still shrouded in secrecy. The 93<BR>year-old newspaper has been at the centre of speculations<BR>since African Analysis, a London-based newsletter, disclosed<BR>early August that the Kenyan daily would be sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African Analysis further reported that the buyer, for an<BR>undisclosed amount, would be Mr. Mark Too whose challenge &quot;is<BR>to make the Standard as upward mobile&quot; as possible with<BR>stepped-up circulation. Mr. Too, Vice-chairman of Lonrho East<BR>Africa and a local, is a close associate of Kenya's ruling<BR>elite.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Lonrho, the owners of the East African Standard then,<BR>were concerned that if the paper was sold locally to parties<BR>connected to the ruling Kenya African national Union (KANU)<BR>party, the sale could damage the company's reputation. It was<BR>also feared that the sale of the daily to buyers directly<BR>associated the government could cause problems with the<BR>international community who have already expressed concern at<BR>the concentration of print and broadcast media ownership in<BR>government hands and the overall freedom of the press in<BR>Kenya.<BR>There were also fears in Nairobi that any sale of the paper<BR>could lead to substantial job losses. Mr. Too however denied<BR>he was buying the newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So when Mr. Bob Holt, Managing Director of the East<BR>African Standard, convened a meeting August 28 to explain the<BR>implications of the takeover by new investors, employees were<BR>not amused. Employees accused him of not being open about the<BR>newspaper's sale. It was only Mr. Holt, they said, who knew<BR>who the real owners of the East African Standard were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The employees further accused him of having received<BR>generous terminal benefits and of &quot;leaving them in darkness&quot;.<BR>The confrontation came just a day after a representative of<BR>the buyers, described obscurely as 'the new investors&quot; and<BR>&quot;the new majority shareholders&quot;, visited the newspaper<BR>installations in Nairobi. Mr. Robin Sewell, a London-based<BR>director of the holding company, had pledged a hands-off<BR>policy and said the new owners wished to see the company run<BR>professionally. He had named Mr. Too as the paper's new<BR>chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the meeting with Mr. Holt employees gave a<BR>September 5, noon ultimatum for the following issues to be<BR>addressed; An early retirement scheme for employees who were<BR>no longer interested in continuing with the work; Payment of<BR>all dues for those wishing to end their contract with the<BR>newspaper and start afresh with the new owner, and; Payment<BR>of all dues to those who wanted to continue. They further<BR>demanded that the company give all staff members job<BR>guarantees in writing as &quot;verbal assurances cannot hold<BR>water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holt had earlier described the sale of the newspaper to<BR>new owners as &quot;an enthusiastic and adventurous venture,&quot;<BR>saying that the new London- based investors had bought 53 per<BR>cent of the total shares. He added that the new investors<BR>would be very demanding and would like to see sales and<BR>advertising improve. Contacted over allegations that he and a<BR>few others had been paid terminal benefits, Mr. Holt said, &quot;I<BR>am not leaving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later Mr. Holt made it clear that the pension scheme was<BR>governed by specific laws which state that a pension scheme<BR>cannot be released to any worker until he or she leaves the<BR>company service. He reiterated that all employees will have<BR>the opportunity to transfer the pension scheme from Lonrho<BR>into one operated by the new owners, subject to clearance<BR>from the income tax department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile the East African Standard employees have refused<BR>to sign a circular requiring them to indicate whether they<BR>wished to resign or continue working for the newspaper.<BR>Instead, four of the staff representatives wrote to the<BR>Managing Director Bob Holt saying they stood by their earlier<BR>memorandum in which they demanded full terminal benefits<BR>before September 5 (tomorrow).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paper's sale came after it had improved on its page<BR>designs and colour scheme, adopting a changed approach to the<BR>presentation of news and feature items in an attempt to boost<BR>sales. Speculations were rife that the paper was loosing on<BR>both sales and advertisements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>August 31, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - In what constitutes a major breakthrough for the<BR>self-declared Republic of Somaliland and its leader President<BR>Mohammed Ibrahim Egal, a United States State Department<BR>delegation completed on August 28 a visit to the country over<BR>a number of days. US State Department officials described the<BR>visit as &quot;a fact finding mission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delegation was led by senior officials from the<BR>American Embassy in Djibouti. It included an official from<BR>the Somali Desk in Washington as well as USAID officials.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to President Egal, the delegation was keen to<BR>learn the problem his country faced since it broke away from<BR>Somalia in 1991. Egal said USAID had pledged food aid to his<BR>country, with a population of about 1 million people. He<BR>added that in future Somaliland's affairs &quot;would be handled<BR>by the American Embassy in Djibouti and not Nairobi where the<BR>American Ambassador to Somalia resides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Egal expressed gratitude for the visit which he<BR>described as a tentative sign of recognition of Somaliland by<BR>Washington and the rest of the world. Since it was formed by<BR>a series of elders' meetings in May 1991, Somaliland has<BR>attracted little attention from the United States and the<BR>rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers believe the American visit at this time is<BR>closely linked to the threat by Somali factional leader<BR>Mohammed Farah Aideed to disarm Somaliland and other areas of<BR>Somalia by force within six months, if the authorities in<BR>Hargeissa failed to do so. It was clear that Aideed was<BR>trying to assert his control over the old greater Somalia<BR>including Somaliland. The Americans are alarmed that Aideed<BR>is in the process of reconstituting an army. There are<BR>reports of Libya's involvement and funding for Aideed's new<BR>army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since its formation in 1991, Somaliland has been<BR>relatively peaceful until early 1994, when an insurrection by<BR>a former leader of the country--before it joined a unified<BR>Somalia in 1960--began to cause instability in Somaliland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egal has blamed Aideed for the security problems including<BR>the insurrection led by Mr. Ibrahim Tur.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>August 31, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KHARTOUM - The Sudanese military junta has ordered the<BR>release of former Prime Minister Sadik el-Mahdi and several<BR>other political detainees previously held on alleged<BR>political offenses, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA)<BR>reported on August 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SUNA quoted junta spokesman Abdul-Basit Sabdarat as saying<BR>that El- Mahdi and other political detainees were released<BR>following a government order. &quot;The Sudan is now free of all<BR>political detainees after the concerned authorities carried<BR>out the decision of the National Security Council on the<BR>release of all political detainees,&quot; Sabdarat was quoted as<BR>saying. Upon release, El-Mahdi, who was detained three months<BR>ago for having criticised a high-level official, along with<BR>31 other political prisoners, was met at home in Omdurman by<BR>scores of his supporters the same day, witnesses said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former prime minister was arrested in May on charges<BR>of conspiracy against the government of General Omar Hassan<BR>el-Beshir, which had overthrown him in a bloodless coup<BR>d'etat in 1989, after he criticised Hassan el-Tourabi, the<BR>main power behind the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime in<BR>Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The seven-member National Security Council, headed by Eldetainees without exception within 72 hours. Of the 32 other<BR>Beshir, decided on August 23 to release all political<BR>political prisoners, 19 were from El-Mahdi's dissolved Umma<BR>Party, eight from the outlawed Communist Party and five from<BR>the disbanded Arab Socialist Ba'athist Party, Sabdarat said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, contradictions have arisen as to the exact number<BR>of political detainees in Sudan. State Minister at the<BR>presidency Mahdi Ibrahim put the figure at less than 30, but<BR>the legal advisor and spokesman for the Human Rights<BR>Consultative Council, Ahmed el-Muft, says there were more<BR>than 70 people held on political and economic sabotage<BR>charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The release of political detainees in Sudan came only a<BR>day after the military ruler, General El-Beshir, was reported<BR>to have announced that the country would hold presidential<BR>and parliamentary elections next year. State-run radio<BR>Omdurman quoted the President as having made the announcement<BR>at a rally in the west of the country on August 22. Beshir,<BR>who seized power in a coup in June 1989, did not give a<BR>precise date for the elections, and did not say whether he<BR>would contest the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recent developments come as the military-led<BR>government in Khartoum face accusations of serious human<BR>rights abuses throughout the country and opposition groups<BR>unite in a final attempt to end the military dictatorship.<BR>Neighbouring governments are also up in arms against<BR>Khartoum, accusing it of sponsoring rebel groups bent on<BR>overthrowing their respective governments. The United States<BR>denounces Sudan for harbouring and training terrorists to<BR>subvert non-Islamic governments in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month the London-based human rights monitoring group,<BR>African Rights, accused Khartoum of carrying out genocide of<BR>the Nuba people and appealed to the international community<BR>to intervene &quot;to prevent this crime from being perpetrated&quot;.<BR>In its report, African Rights accused Khartoum of carrying<BR>many atrocities in the mainly Christian and animist southern<BR>Sudan, where rebel groups took up arms against Khartoum in<BR>1983. The atrocities included, torching of villages, murder,<BR>rape and mass arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the southern rebels and the political<BR>opposition decided at the end of June to unite against the<BR>Islamic government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>August 31, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA - Former Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi was<BR>elected Prime Minister of the country by the federal<BR>parliament on August 23, bringing to an end a four-year<BR>transition period that followed the overthrow of Marxist<BR>dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The previous day, the federal assembly had elected Meles's<BR>Information Minister Negasso Guidada, a Christian member of<BR>the Oromo ethnic majority, to the largely ceremonial role of<BR>president. The new federal assembly, which consists of 540<BR>representatives from Meles' Ethiopian People's Revolutionary<BR>Democratic Front (EPRDF) out of a total 548 deputies, was<BR>elected in the first multi-party elections in May.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The choice of an Oromo to the largely honorary post was<BR>not a major surprise, but observers had generally expected a<BR>Muslim to be elected to the post. Oromos are divided<BR>virtually equally between Christians and Muslims, while<BR>Tigreans, of which Meles is one, are Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Major opposition parties boycotted the poll, claiming it<BR>was a farce, although it received broad support from the<BR>international community which, led by the United States, had<BR>largely backed the democratisation process that has developed<BR>over four years of transitional rule. Opposition parties<BR>alleged that the transition, which was meant to last only two<BR>years, gave the EPRDF time to turn the democratisation<BR>process to its own advantage. They also accused Meles of<BR>wanting to break up Ethiopia, a reference to the country's<BR>new constitution which provides for the right of Ethiopian<BR>regions to secede along ethnic or linguistic lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two years ago, Meles, who led the mainly Tigrean and<BR>Eritrean forces which overturned the communist military<BR>regime of Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991, agreed to<BR>the independence of Eritrea after it waged a 30-year war of<BR>independence against successive Ethiopian governments.<BR>Negasso, in his first statement as president on August 22,<BR>which was declared a public holiday, said his priorities<BR>would be to &quot;reinforce the process of democratisation and<BR>peace&quot; and &quot;economic development&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in his first speech since election, Meles delivered a<BR>strong warning to opponents at home and abroad not to try to<BR>stir ethnic unrest in the country, and attacked the private<BR>press which, he said, &quot;spread hatred, putting democracy in<BR>danger&quot;. &quot;I want to warn those who continue to break the law<BR>and who preach war that the government will take vigorous<BR>measures against them,&quot; Meles said, but added that he was<BR>ready to assist &quot;responsible newspapers which criticised the<BR>government in a responsible manner without inventing<BR>stories&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new premier also urged Ethiopia's intellectuals to<BR>return to work, in return for which his government would<BR>treat them as &quot;rare pearls&quot;. Meles also announced a<BR>forthcoming restructuring of the armed forces, &quot;so as to<BR>ensure an equitable representation of ethnic diversity at all<BR>levels&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABUJA - The military is to blame for the &quot;continuous<BR>distressing situation&quot; that Nigeria finds itself in, because<BR>soldiers have frequently interfered in the country's<BR>&quot;democratic development at every slight excuse,&quot; the<BR>country's Catholic bishops have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a communique issued at the end of their conference held<BR>at Makurdi, Benue State earlier this month, the bishops<BR>censured the military for its role in causing several<BR>constitutional crises and urged them to exercise selfThe bishops challenged the people of Nigeria &quot;henceforth<BR>restraint in their ambition to rule.<BR>to learn and to defend their constitution against any<BR>interference by any group, no matter how well armed.&quot; The<BR>bishops observed that experience of other nations has proved<BR>it is possible to do so, &quot;even against tanks and guns&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Disapproving the current constitutional amendments by the<BR>military regime to set transitional programmes, the<BR>communique issued by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of<BR>Nigeria (CBCN), charged that the consultation should not be<BR>left in the hands of dishonest and selfish people,&quot; as to do<BR>so &quot;will for ever continue to be a bone of contention&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The ills of Nigeria cannot be adequately addressed<BR>outside the frame- work of a solid democratic good government<BR>which can encourage and promote free expression of diverse<BR>opinions,&quot; the bishops said.<BR>The Catholic leaders said it was &quot;an insult on the nation for<BR>any group of people, no matter how well intentioned, to claim<BR>monopoly of wisdom and decide for all how things must go&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bishops criticised the stretch of time for the<BR>transition programme, saying it would merely lead to<BR>political complications that is meant to confuse the people<BR>in the march towards democracy.<BR>Instead they suggested that a year was long enough for<BR>Nigerians to arrive at successful elections &quot;if there was an<BR>honest commitment on the part the present regime to honour<BR>its proclaimed commitment of leaving political power as soon<BR>as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the outcome of the draft constitution, the bishops said<BR>the confusion and controversy that surrounded the result<BR>appeared to bear their initial expressed skepticism<BR>concerning &quot;the need and appropriateness of drafting the<BR>document.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CBCN warned Nigerians that there can never be a<BR>perfect constitution, and that a constitution would only work<BR>if there was a minimum of good will and effort to live<BR>together as a nation. There was an urgent need to address the<BR>factors responsible for rendering &quot;our constitutions<BR>unworkable,&quot; the bishops stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The clerics further noted with concern, the appalling<BR>state of the country where human needs such as food, health,<BR>and shelter were becoming luxurious only available to a few<BR>people. &quot;The quality of life for the majority has continued<BR>to deteriorate, with the unemployed and underemployed people<BR>swelling the ranks of the poor and destitutes.&quot;<BR>Because of galloping inflation, people's purchasing power,<BR>noted the bishops, has been drastically reduced and even<BR>high-scale salaries were mere allowances. The people of<BR>Nigeria have been left to hope against hope with little if<BR>any energy to even groan or complain, the bishops lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bishops vowed to continue condemning the ills in the<BR>country as they have done before as long as those problems<BR>continue to plague Nigeria. They asked Nigerian people not to<BR>relent in their prayers to God to continue saving them as<BR>&quot;the crisis hangs over the nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile Nigerians are holding their breath as they wait<BR>anxiously for the outcome of the decision of the Provisional<BR>Ruling Council (PRC) on the fate of the alleged coup leaders,<BR>who include former head of state retired General Olusegun<BR>Obasanjo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council's decision is expected to be announced by the<BR>head of the ruling junta, General Sani Abacha, during his<BR>independence anniversary broadcast on October 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military regime has been under pressure from both<BR>inside and outside Nigeria to exercise clemency for the 40<BR>alleged coup plotters, with US President Bill Clinton warning<BR>Nigeria with dare consequences if it went ahead and executed<BR>the plotters. But General Abacha's junta responded to<BR>Clinton's threat by accusing Washington of meddling in<BR>Nigeria's internal affairs and of having no respect for the<BR>country's constituted authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among African leaders who have either met with Nigeria's<BR>leader to plead clemency for the alleged plotters or sent<BR>emissaries, include Presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe,<BR>Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Nelson Mandela of South Africa,<BR>and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, President of the Nairobi-based<BR>All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>September 15, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - The entrenchment of media freedom in a new<BR>Zambian constitution is under threat following a move by the<BR>government to avoid holding a referendum on the adoption of<BR>the new constitution and Bill of Rights, the Zambian biThe Post report is technically in breach of a decree<BR>weekly The Post reports in its August 22 edition.<BR>issued by President Fredrick Chiluba on July 17 banning<BR>public debate on the draft constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post article, written by the paper's Managing Editor<BR>Bright Mwape, quotes un-named source within government and<BR>the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) as saying<BR>that the government will by-pass a referendum for the<BR>adoption of the new constitution by retaining the 1991 Bill<BR>of Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the 1991 constitution, only a new Bill of Rights has<BR>to be subjected to a referendum, whereas other parts of a new<BR>constitution can be adopted by a simple vote in parliament,<BR>The Post claimed. Recommendations for a new Bill of Rights<BR>are contained in a report submitted by the Constitutional<BR>Review Commission (CRC) appointed by Zambian President<BR>Fredrick Chiluba in mid-1993. The CRC report says this<BR>recommended bill of rights was a &quot;radical departure&quot; from the<BR>existing one, passed in 1991. and was based on the premise<BR>that 'an open society based on democracy and freedom was best<BR>secured by a positive entrenchment of fundamental human<BR>rights in the Constitution&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1991 Bill of Rights only recognises the right to<BR>freedom of expression, and does not include specific<BR>provisions guaranteeing freedom of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bill of Rights proposed by the CRC would guarantee:<BR>free expression, media freedom, and the freedom of artistic<BR>creativity; that all media be free from censorship; the<BR>independence of all public media; the right of journalists to<BR>protect their sources; that no laws can be passed restricting<BR>media freedom; and free access to official information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CRC started its work in early 1994, and after one and<BR>half year of gathering submissions from all over Zambia, made<BR>public its findings and recommendations on June 26. However,<BR>publication of the report - the final draft of which was only<BR>fully endorsed by three of the original 125 commissioners,<BR>with a further three commissioners endorsing it with<BR>reservations - followed a series of leaks and attempts by the<BR>authorities to keep the report secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The weekly Sun newspaper published details of the report<BR>in its 14 edition. The Post followed suit, publishing a draft<BR>of the CRS's constitution in its May 16 editions. The Sun<BR>article revealed that the CRC was recommending that only<BR>Zambians born of Zambian parents could stand for president; a<BR>clause which, if adopted, would bar former president Kenneth<BR>Kaunda from running for the presidency. Kaunda, whose parents<BR>were Malawian, looks set to challenge Chiluba for the<BR>presidency in elections scheduled for next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When The Sun's report appeared, News Editor Lweendo<BR>Hamusankwa was called in for questioning by the police on<BR>four consecutive days. However, The Sun's lawyer, Darlington<BR>Mwape, told the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) in<BR>Windhoek, Namibia, the police were unable to formulate any<BR>concrete charges against either the newspaper nor Hamusankwa .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 23 the government successfully applied for a<BR>court injunction barring The Sun from publishing any further<BR>information relating to the proposed new constitution.<BR>However, the court injunction was suspended on May 3, and<BR>then overturned completely by the High Court the following<BR>month, by which time The Post had published the CRS's report<BR>in full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 26, the government-owned Times of Zambia also<BR>published the CRS's report in full, apparently with the<BR>blessing of the CRC. Then on July 17, President Frederick<BR>Chiluba banned by presidential decree (Section 58 of the<BR>Penal Code) any further public debate on the draft<BR>constitution pending the completion of a cabinet White Paper<BR>on the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MISA representative in Zambia, Fanwell Chembo, says the<BR>presidential decree has so far had little success in stifling<BR>debate on the constitution. According to Chembo, there is<BR>pressure from civic and human rights groups, the lawyers<BR>association, and the media for a new constitution - or any<BR>amendments to the existing constitution - to be adopted by<BR>public referendum, or broad-based constituent assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba appears determined to resist putting the<BR>constitution to a referendum. &quot;We cannot be subjected to a<BR>referendum. After all Kaunda abolished all referenda,&quot;<BR>Chiluba told a press conference, The Post of August 22<BR>reports. &quot;We are government and will decide on the method of<BR>adoption (of the constitution).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba further said the new constitution would be adopted<BR>by means of a vote in parliament - a parliament in which the<BR>President's ruling MMD has an 80 per cent majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposing the government's move, Chairperson of Zambia<BR>Civic Education Association, Lucy Sichome, is quoted by The<BR>Post as saying: &quot;The 1991 Bill of Rights is inadequate. The<BR>proposed bill has enhanced people's rights; doing away with<BR>that is defeating the very essence of reviewing a<BR>constitution at such great cost.&quot; The publication of the<BR>CRC's report, and the release of the CRC's draft constitution<BR>has been plagued by other controversies. On June 20 The Post<BR>reported that Chiluba had censured the CRC for making the<BR>draft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then on June 23, The Post reported that Chiluba had<BR>censured the CRC for making the draft constitution public<BR>&quot;before government could have access to it&quot;. In response,<BR>Commission chairman, John Mwanakatwe, explained that the<BR>commission acted under pressure from foreign donors who<BR>demanded that Zambians see the contents of the document<BR>first. The work of the CRC was largely paid for out of donor<BR>funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The draft Bill of Rights drawn up by the CRC also includes<BR>protection of the rights of children and women; economic<BR>rights and the creation of a permanent Human Rights<BR>Commission, which also are not in the 1991 constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LONDON 15 -The East Africa regional office of the<BR>International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN),<BR>has applauded the recent successful prosecution in the UK of<BR>three people for illegal sale of Chinese &quot;medicine&quot;<BR>containing rhinoceros horn, tiger bone and bear bile.<BR>This is &quot;a major step&quot; in curtailing trade in endangered<BR>species under the Convention of International Trade in<BR>Endangered Species of Wildlife and the Flora (CITES), a<BR>spokesperson of the IUCN East Africa office said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CITES, a treaty signed by a total of 130 countries, among<BR>them the three East African countries - Kenya, Uganda and<BR>Tanzania - bans all international commercial trade in parts<BR>of rhino, tiger, elephant and many other endangered species.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By becoming signatories the contracting parties--both<BR>consumers and producers--bind themselves to enforcing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rhino and the tiger are particularly endangered as a<BR>result of trade in their body parts which are much prized in<BR>oriental Chinese medicine. However, there is no scientific<BR>evidence for the efficacy of these medicines. On the contrary<BR>they are generally accepted in the West as bogus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Chinese believe passionately in these medicines--<BR>the rhino horn is largely used for male potency treatment<BR>while tiger bone is used mainly on plasters which are applied<BR>directly to an area of the body with rheumatism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The products are not just going to the UK, but areas of<BR>the world with sizable Chinese migrant populations are also<BR>targeted particularly in the United States, South East Asia<BR>and the ASEAN region.<BR>In two separate cases heard in the UK early this month, two<BR>Chinese herbalists were fined a total US$ 8000 after<BR>admitting charges of selling remedies containing parts of<BR>endangered animals. A number of other oriental doctors have<BR>been successfully prosecuted on similar charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking after receiving the news from London, Mercie<BR>Ejigu, IUCNs Eastern Africa Regional Representative said:<BR>&quot;Although IUCN may support the use of natural resources when<BR>such use is sustainable, the swift action by UK authorities<BR>will serve as a lesson to traders of endangered species and<BR>encourage countries with these species to enforce legal<BR>restrictions more effectively.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>September 15, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - The notorious Robben Island off the coast<BR>of Cape Town is to South Africa what Alcatraz is to America.<BR>Throughout its history as a prison for high profile<BR>prisoners, it has had no record of an escaped prisoner, much<BR>like the legendary prison of Alcatraz off the coast of<BR>California, USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that image is slowly fading away following the release<BR>of many of its occupants, including President Nelson Mandela,<BR>Walter Sisulu, and many others. A South African cabinet<BR>committee has now been set up to look at ways of turning the<BR>island into a profitable possession when it ceases to be run<BR>as a prison at the end of 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High on the list of bidders for the island are commercial<BR>tour operators, hotel developers and leisure businesses who<BR>are prepared to invest millions of rands to turn the island<BR>into one of the world's premier tourist spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But an unlikely proposal has also been received by the<BR>committee: to turn the island into an Open University. The<BR>proposal comes from Lord Michael Young of Dartington,<BR>England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dartington proposes that the island could be made into a<BR>distance learning outfit which could be used to broadcast<BR>programmes to the mainland for thousands of South Africans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Press reports here indicate that Lord Michael has such<BR>brilliant credentials that the committee charged with<BR>receiving the proposals is likely to look at his ideas more<BR>than twice. Among his many accolades, he is credited with<BR>setting up Britain's Open University in the 1960s and since<BR>then he has master-minded the setting up of 30 other<BR>institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, at the age of 80, he is chairman of the International<BR>Extension College which has 30 Open Universities affiliated<BR>to it, many of which he founded himself. The proposals to<BR>turn the island into an institution of learning will not be<BR>operated in competition to existing Universities. It will<BR>largely send radio and television signals from Robben Island<BR>to local tutorial centres to be built all over the country<BR>where students could receive their tuition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood that adequate funding could be obtained<BR>from willing funders abroad, after which the government of<BR>South Africa could take the responsibility to fund the<BR>institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the moment, the island is said to have about 200<BR>buildings in good repair, communal structures, an educational<BR>centre, shops and a regular ferry service to the Cape Town<BR>waterfront, all of which could be used by people to be<BR>employed to write the self-study materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lord Michael also believes that the Open University idea<BR>could be part of the Reconstruction and Development Programme<BR>which was set up by the current government of national unity<BR>to correct the development imbalances of the past apartheid<BR>governments.</SPAN></P>

Kpormakpor, the LNTG-1 tenure ran<BR>from March 1994 to September 1, 1995 after rival warlords in<BR>the nearly six year- old civil war came together in August to<BR>sign a peace accord. Three of the warlords were seated in<BR>another interim government on September 1, to prepare for<BR>elections next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charles Taylor, leader of the National Patriotic Front of<BR>Liberia (NPFL) that sparked off the civil war when it invaded<BR>from Ivory Coast on December 24,1989; George Boley of the<BR>Liberia Peace Council (LPC) and; Alhaji Kromah, leader of the<BR>Mandingo faction of the United Liberation Movement of Liberia<BR>(ULIMO) were sworn in along with three civilians in a sixbeginning of the process to implement the latest peace<BR>member collective presidency. The ceremony marks the<BR>agreement signed on August 20 in Abuja, Nigeria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although there have been reports of renewed fighting,<BR>violence and looting, the peace accord appears to be holding<BR>and international aid agencies are feeding the hungry again<BR>in the country's interior.<BR>Aid workers pulled out of much of Liberia's interior last<BR>October, saying their equipment was being stolen for use by<BR>the armed factions and that growing chaos made it impossible<BR>for them to work. The French arm of Medecins san Frontiers<BR>(MSF) has now opened a feeding centre for severely<BR>malnourished children at Totota, 130 km (80 miles) northeast<BR>of Monrovia. The aid organisation took in 112 children on the<BR>first day, September 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Every day we're receiving more and more people as news<BR>travels that we have a feeding centre opened,&quot; said MSF<BR>France coordinator Fiona Terry. &quot;Most of them are in very bad<BR>condition. We have space for only 300 but was practically<BR>overfilled in the first three days.&quot;<BR>The fighters, some of them belonging to the LNTG-1, are also<BR>pleased about the feeding arrangements, especially in central<BR>Liberia. Further north, however, especially nearer the border<BR>with Guinea, many areas are virtually empty, as people have<BR>left to seek food and security elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in a seven-page statement, the JPC accuses the defunct<BR>out-going LNTG-1, which like its predecessor, the Interim<BR>Government of National Unity (IGNU) headed by Prof. Amos<BR>Sawyer is &quot;leaving the scene with a dismal human rights<BR>record and reckless attitude towards the suffering people and<BR>in particular, &quot;the upholding and dispensation of justice<BR>throughout its tenure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It has miserably failed, even with all the resources,<BR>cooperation, and opportunities at its disposal, to establish<BR>the basic guarantee for the respect of human rights and the<BR>dispensation of justice&quot;, the JPC statement says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 15, 1994, the statement notes, armed gangs<BR>stormed the Cowfield Duport Road area, killing over 50<BR>innocent civilians mainly women and children. Thousands of<BR>others were made homeless.<BR>Following the massacre, the citizens took to the main streets<BR>of Monrovia denouncing the &quot;heinous act&quot;. This lead to the<BR>LNTG-1 announcing it would set up a commission of inquiry to<BR>investigate the massacre. But nothing happened, thereby<BR>fortifying the sense of impunity on the part of murderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The JPC, headed by Samuel Kofi Woods, a winner of the<BR>Reebok Human Rights Awards for 1994, maintains that an<BR>investigation into the gruesome murder of innocent civilians<BR>could have marked &quot;a significant beginning to curbing the<BR>mountains of violence directed at civilian populations and<BR>thus demonstrating the LNTG-1 expressed commitment to human<BR>rights and to the welfare of the Liberian people.&quot;<BR>The Justice and Peace Commission concludes by urging the<BR>Liberian people to cooperate with the incoming Council of<BR>State officials for the realization of its mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile &quot;the United States is prepared to assist Liberia<BR>to reconstruct and assume once again its rightful place in<BR>the community of nations if the ceasefire is maintained and<BR>the new Liberia National Transitional Government (LNTG-2)<BR>moves effectively to disarm all the factions,&quot; Dane F. Smith,<BR>U.S. Special envoy to Liberia has said.<BR>Mr. Smith was in Monrovia, along with Colonel Macarthur<BR>Deshazer, Africa Director on the US National Security Council<BR>to represent the United States Government at the seating of<BR>the new six-man Council of State of Liberia (CSL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Ambassador Smith: &quot;United States government also<BR>supports the International Foundation for Electoral System<BR>(IFES) which stands ready to provide technical support<BR>already identified by the Election Commission in 1992 and<BR>1993&quot;. In a recent disclosure Nyudueh Monorkorman, Election<BR>Commissioner, said that &quot;about thirty political parties and<BR>independent candidates are expected to contest the<BR>forthcoming general elections slated for October next year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The USA, Liberia's closest ally in the West, provided over<BR>US$ 500 million in aid to late Samuel Doe's regime. But in<BR>1990, following the out break of the civil war, the Bush<BR>Administration said it would not assist Liberia to end the<BR>war because it was an internal conflict. Since then the US<BR>government has continued to assist Liberia with relief aid<BR>estimated at over US$ 50 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia was founded in 1821 as a &quot;haven&quot; for freed<BR>American slaves by the American Colonization Society, with<BR>the first American Negroes arriving a year later. The colony<BR>became independent in 1847, but remained very, very close to<BR>America. In fact, until the 80s the American dollar was the<BR>legal tender or currency in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1979, after years of political stability, a proposal to<BR>increase the price of rice, the main staple food, produced<BR>widespread violence. A year later, in a violent coup, Master<BR>Sergeant Samuel K Doe, then only 28, lead a group of<BR>discontented soldiers of national or indigenous origin to end<BR>over 100 years of rule by Americo-Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But opposition to Doe's brutal rule by Liberians of all<BR>shades and persuasion, developed in 1990 into a full-scale<BR>and later confused war, resulting in the murder of Doe and<BR>descent into anarchy and economic misery. Until last month,<BR>over a dozen peace accords have been signed by the various<BR>warring factions but to no avail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LONDON - The Archbishop of Canterbury and spiritual head<BR>of the worldwide Anglican Communion, the Rt. Rev. Dr. George<BR>Carey, will visit Sudan next month to &quot;recognise the<BR>contribution of Archbishop Yugusuk to the life of the<BR>Episcopal Church of Sudan and to the whole Anglican<BR>Communion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benjamin Yugusuk, the aging Archbishop of Sudan announced<BR>his retirement last month after chairing, in Nairobi, a<BR>meeting of the Synod of Bishops of the Episcopal Church of<BR>Sudan (Anglican).<BR>Noting that Archbishop Yugusuk has a record of &quot;extraordinary<BR>courage and commitment to his people during repeated attacks<BR>on his home town, and diocesan base, Juba,&quot; Dr. Carey's<BR>office said that Yugusuk's retirement provides the<BR>opportunity for the Archbishop of Canterbury to return to<BR>Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a considerable time, the Archbishop Yugusuk's home was<BR>a shallow trench, from which he exercised devoted pastoral<BR>care for the thousands of displaced people in the area. He<BR>walked for many miles into the bush, in the face of much<BR>personal danger, to be with them. &quot;He was also responsible<BR>for leading the two wings of the Anglican Church, which had<BR>split in 1985, to reconciliation.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he cancelled his visit to Khartoum in 1994, &quot;out of<BR>distress at the disappointment caused to Christians in the<BR>North of Sudan,&quot; Dr. Carey expressed hope that he would be<BR>able to reinstate the visit before too long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Carey will arrive in Khartoum from Cairo, Egypt where<BR>he will pay a pastoral visit as a guest of the Episcopal<BR>Church and its Bishop, the Rt. Rev Ghais Abdul Malik, from 1The Rt. Rev.  John Dennis, Bishop of St. Edmundsbury and<BR>6 October. The Archbishop will be accompanied by Mrs. Carey.<BR>Ipswich, and Dr. Carey's Bishop for Oriental Orthodox<BR>Affairs; the Rev Dr. Richard Marsh, the Archbishop's<BR>Secretary for Ecumenical Affairs and Canon Andrew Deuchar,<BR>Archbishop's Secretary for Anglican Communion Affairs, will<BR>also accompany Dr. Carey to Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While in Egypt, Dr. Carey will preach at Episcopal<BR>services in both Cairo and Alexandria and visit social<BR>projects of the Episcopal Church in and around Cairo at<BR>Menouf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Carey is also expected to pay courtesy calls on senior<BR>members of both the national and local governments, and also<BR>visit the Sheikh of al-Azajr and the Grand Mufti of Cairo<BR>together with other significant Muslim leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The friendship between the Anglican Communion and the<BR>Coptic Orthodox Church is long-standing,&quot; said Dr. Carey's<BR>office, &quot;and so the Archbishop will pay a courtesy call on<BR>Pope Shenouda III and will visit Coptic monasteries in the<BR>Wadi-al-Natroun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is also expected that Dr. Carey will visit the<BR>monastery of St. Catherine's on Sinai and meet Patriarch<BR>Pathenioe of Alexandria and All-Africa, together with leaders<BR>of the Coptic Catholic and Coptic Protestant Churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During his two-day visit to Sudan, Dr. Carey will meet<BR>Anglican bishops in Khartoum, as well as leaders of other<BR>Churches. He will also address an open-air service. While in<BR>Khartoum, he will also visit Mandela camp on the southern<BR>outskirts of Khartoum, and also pay a courtesy call on the<BR>President of Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He will further have discussions with other<BR>representatives of the regime at an informal meeting of the<BR>Committee for Inter-Religious Dialogue, and a lunch given by<BR>the Speaker of the National Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, &quot;the Archbishop of Canterbury,&quot; his office<BR>stressed, &quot;is visiting Sudan at the invitation of the<BR>Archbishop of Sudan, and will be staying in Khartoum at the<BR>Episcopal Church Guest House.&quot; In Juba, capital of South<BR>Sudan, Dr. Carey will visit a camp for displaced people. He<BR>will be accompanied for the trip to Sudan, among others, by<BR>the Bishop of Ramsbury, representing the Salisbury Diocese,<BR>with whom Sudan has been linked for over twenty years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>September 15, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - Pope John Paul II, head of the world's<BR>largest Christian denomination, arrives in South Africa on<BR>16th September as part of a three-nation tour of Africa which<BR>will include Cameroon and Kenya.<BR>This will be the pontiff's first visit to South Africa which<BR>attained liberation in April 1994, following years of white<BR>rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In September 1988, the Pope visited the southern African<BR>countries of Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland and<BR>Mozambique. At the time, he skipped South Africa because of<BR>the racial policies of the former apartheid government, but<BR>promised to come once non-racial democracy was attained.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pope will arrive in the country amidst unprecedented<BR>labour unrest involving public health workers who are<BR>demanding pay increases and improvements in their conditions<BR>of service. He also comes at a time when the country's<BR>political in-fighting between the largest black-led political<BR>parties, the African National Congress (ANC) and the Inkatha<BR>Freedom Party (IFP), are at loggerheads over a number of<BR>issues, notably, the writing of the new constitution, the<BR>impasse over international mediation and other issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Partly as a result of this impasse, violence continues<BR>unabated, despite the government's deployment of thousands of<BR>army and other security forces in the volatile areas.<BR>Spiraling crime rate, unemployment, the spread of HIV, the<BR>virus that causes the dread Aids, and many other social<BR>problems also form part of a bleak backdrop to the visit of<BR>the most travelled pontiff in the history of the Roman<BR>Catholic church.<BR>In each of the country the Pope will visit, he hopes to<BR>attend national Bishops' meetings. He also will come face to<BR>face with problems common to the African church:<BR>Africanisation of the liturgy; polygamy and what to do with<BR>polygamous men who want to convert to Christianity; celibacy<BR>and; corruption amongst Catholic and other Christian leaders<BR>and ordinary people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Vatican sources, the Pope is expected to make<BR>a vigorous attack on the rampant corruption in Africa and on<BR>corrupt governments. He is also expected to denounce the<BR>West's neglect of Africa.<BR>The pontiff is further expected to name the World Bank and<BR>the International Monetary Fund in a plea to all creditors to<BR>lighten the debt burden which was &quot;suffocating&quot; African<BR>countries.<BR>Citing wars, despair and frightful deprivation as dominant<BR>problems, the Pope's message will reportedly refer to corrupt<BR>African governments as &quot;thieves&quot; and urge Catholics to play a<BR>clearer part in establishing democracy and the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many African nations live under authoritarian and<BR>oppressive regimes which deny their citizens basic human<BR>rights, the text of the Pope's message says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It decries to the dishonesty of governments which connive<BR>with local and foreign private interests to siphon off<BR>national resources and transfer public monies into private<BR>bank account abroad.<BR>The Pope will tell international bodies they should make use<BR>of legal means to see that the money is returned.<BR>In South Africa the Pope will be briefed about the country's<BR>role in the development of the region and in African in<BR>general, and its possible implications for the church in<BR>Africa. Among the dignitaries the Pope will meet are<BR>President Nelson Mandela, Deputy Presidents Thabo Mbeki and<BR>F.W. de Klerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking about his impending visit to Africa's youngest,<BR>but richest nation, the Pope said: &quot;We take particular<BR>pleasure in sharing the joy in the hearts of the people of<BR>South Africa after so many years of suffering and lack of<BR>mutual understanding. May brotherly dialogue rather than the<BR>use of arms resolve all tensions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pope will be delivering an &quot;apostolic exhortation&quot; to<BR>the regional conferences of Bishops, offering instructions<BR>based on the African synod he chaired in Rome early last<BR>year. The synod drew up a &quot;balance-sheet of the church's<BR>strengths and weaknesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1587 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>September 27, 1995<BR>by Joseph K'Amolo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - Better known for its &quot;strangling&quot; economic<BR>policies, the World Bank has this time round warned the<BR>developing world of the dangers of not investing in water,<BR>one of life's most crucial resources. The warning comes just<BR>five years away from the projected water for All by the year<BR>2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every morning before going to school, Milca Nyambok, 11,<BR>treks to an open water reservoir some two kilometres away.<BR>Like other residents of Asembo, young Milca has to fetch<BR>water on a daily basis, a chore that saps energy and takes<BR>time that could be applied to other productive efforts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not unlike many African villages, Asembo in Siaya<BR>District, in Kenya's Nyanza Province, has a chronic water<BR>problem.<BR>The few available water sources are man-made wells, which<BR>collect water only seasonally. The wells are open places and<BR>domestic animals use the water alongside people. When it<BR>rains both human and animal waste find is washed into the<BR>reservoirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During dry spells the dams become empty cracking basins.<BR>Residents are then forced to fetch water from Lake Victoria,<BR>more than 10 km away.<BR>This is a time when bicycle and donkey owners make their<BR>little fortune. They fetch water from the lake and sell it at<BR>around Kshs.10 (0.18 US dollar) per 20 litters. This price<BR>might seem negligible, but for an area whose majority live<BR>below the poverty line, it amounts to a large sum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation of Asembo, some 380 km West of Nairobi, can<BR>be multiplied several times over throughout rural and even<BR>urban Africa.<BR>But apart from the &quot;high&quot; price, the water is dirty and<BR>unsafe for human consumption unless treated. However, out of<BR>ignorance and lack of even the simplest of cleaning<BR>facilities, the water is not treated and is the cause of many<BR>water diseases: typhoid, guinea worm, bilharzia and<BR>dysentery. Unclean water can also cause hepatitis, a disease<BR>that causes the inflammation of the liver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Early this year, for instance, a mysterious diarrhoearal<BR>disease suspected to have been caused by contaminated water<BR>broke out among the people residing along the shores of Lake<BR>Victoria.<BR>The United Nations estimates that dirty water causes about 80<BR>per cent of diseases in developing countries and kills 10<BR>million people each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An outbreak of water related diseases is witnessed each<BR>year at least in one African country. A recent case in point<BR>is the cholera outbreak in Cape Verde Islands in Africa's<BR>north west coast.<BR>Against this background the World Bank warned this August,<BR>that much of the world's population faces a future without<BR>adequate water unless more care and proper investments was<BR>made to protect and make this resource available to more<BR>people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although a large percentage of the earth's surface is<BR>covered by water, only a tiny fraction of this water can be<BR>directly used by human beings. This is because more than 95<BR>per cent of it, is salty in both oceans and seas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1980s substantial gains were made in availing clean<BR>water to the world population. Some 330,000 people in<BR>developing countries gained access to safe supply of drinking<BR>water, official statistics of the International Drinking<BR>Water Supply and Sanitation Decade indicate.<BR>During the same period, about 210,000 people a day achieved<BR>improved means of excreta disposal. The rate of<BR>implementation of the water supply and sanitation more than<BR>doubled that achieved in the 1970s.<BR>Nevertheless, for developing countries, achieving clean water<BR>for all remains elusive largely due to poor economic<BR>performance. In addition, because of rapid population growth<BR>averaging about 250,000 people per day, more than one billion<BR>people are still without access to safe water to date. Some<BR>1.7 billion have inadequate sanitation facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The London-based Earthscan, in a book entitled<BR>&quot;Waterlogged Wealth&quot;, confirms that while clean water is<BR>often expensive enough in industrialised nations, it has a<BR>prohibitive cost in the developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like the Population Action International (PIA), a United<BR>States-based non-governmental organisation, the World Bank<BR>cautions that under such pressures as population growth,<BR>pollution and rising cost of new supplies, providing clean<BR>water poses a growing economic and health challenge,<BR>especially to developing countries. Already some 80 countries<BR>with 40 per cent of the world's population experience water<BR>shortages that threaten agriculture, industry and health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Water scarcity and not land shortage, says the Bank, will<BR>be the main constraint of agriculture in future in the<BR>developing countries. Agriculture consumes 90 per cent of all<BR>water used in these countries.<BR>For Africa where poverty and rising food demand are pushing<BR>farmers increasingly into marginal lands, observes the Bank,<BR>drought-resistant corn varieties will have to be developed as<BR>an alternative to typical dryland crops such as sorghum,<BR>millet and cassava.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emphasizing the seriousness of the water problem, the Bank<BR>predicts that contrary to this century's wars which have been<BR>fought over oil, the next century's wars will be over water.<BR>The Bank notes that engineering and environmental costs of<BR>developing new water resources are much higher than those of<BR>resources already tapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For many cities, the cost of water provided by future<BR>projects can be two to three times the cost of current<BR>supplies, even before environmental costs are factored in,&quot;<BR>says the Bank report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bank also warns that the move by many countries to tap<BR>water for agriculture from non-renewable underground<BR>resources is a self- defeating policy which is likely to<BR>accelerate the process of desertification. Fossil water<BR>resources too can be depleted as quickly as crude oil<BR>reserves, adds the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides rapid population growth especially in urban areas,<BR>the World Bank further notes that, industrial and<BR>agricultural demands for water, and mismanaged land use, have<BR>also affected the supply of good quality water. The Bank<BR>therefore calls for comprehensive and multi- sectoral<BR>planning and design of water supply projects and programmes</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - At a time when women are increasingly condemning<BR>violence against their lot, a new report on the &quot;active<BR>participation&quot; of women in the genocide in Rwanda by the<BR>London- based African Rights was released on the eve of the<BR>Fourth UN Conference in Beijing, China. The report represents<BR>an indictment of the &quot;extraordinary cruelty&quot; of women on<BR>their fellow women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberata went into labour immediately after she had<BR>escaped a major massacre. She had spent only a few hours with<BR>her new born baby son when an elderly neighbour decided that<BR>the boy had already lived too long.<BR>&quot;She asked me about the child with a lot of sympathy in her<BR>voice. She requested that I let her see the baby. When she<BR>saw that it was a baby boy, she picked up a stick and hit the<BR>child. He groaned only once and then he was dead,&quot; narrates<BR>Liberata.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberata's baby boy is but only one of the many victims of<BR>an elderly woman accused of killing more than a hundred<BR>babies, mostly boys. The boys it was feared would be the<BR>future soldiers of the ruling RPF (the Rwanda Patriotic<BR>Front).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the boy's death, the woman unleashed her sons on<BR>Liberata and her family. Two people died in the incident<BR>while Liberata and her daughter were thrown into a pit<BR>latrine from which they escaped.<BR>In a new 163-page report, Not So Innocent the London-based<BR>human rights watchdog, African Rights, examines the active<BR>participation of women in the genocide and killings which<BR>took place in Rwanda in April-July 1994.<BR>A substantial number of women, and even girls, were involved<BR>in the slaughter in countless ways, inflicting extraordinary<BR>cruelty on other women, as well as children and men, charges<BR>the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report was released on August 26 just four days before<BR>the start of the Fourth UN Conference on women (August 30women was high on the agenda of the Beijing Conference. The<BR>September 15) in Beijing, China. Ironically, violence against<BR>Conference unreservedly condemned violence against women with<BR>participants symbolically standing in candle-lit silence for<BR>an hour to mourn violence against women and share stories of<BR>their pain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet in 1994 in Rwanda, the report, Not So Innocent; When<BR>Women Became Killers, charges that thousands of women were<BR>killed by other women. They were often the victims of<BR>educated women, &quot;the very women who had access to political<BR>power and economic means.&quot; Many of the dead were some of<BR>Rwanda's most educated and experienced professionals,<BR>essential to the development of the country and important as<BR>role models for future women leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Studies of the impact of conflict on women's lives has<BR>focused on male violence against women, the disruptive<BR>effects on family life and the additional burdens placed on<BR>women. Little has been said about women capacity for<BR>violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the report with proof, charges that women of every<BR>social category took part in the Rwandan killings. Many of<BR>the women whose crimes are detailed in the report went on<BR>their killing sprees in the company of their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just as some boys accompanied their fathers in the<BR>killings, both boys and girls accompanied their mothers who<BR>had turned into killers, Not So Innocent claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many ordinary women, who did not themselves kill took<BR>their daughters along when they went to &quot;clean out&quot; their<BR>neighbours' houses or to strip and rob the corpses left<BR>behind after large-scale massacres.<BR>The most prominent female killers, such as Minister Pauline<BR>Nyiramasuhuko and Councilor Rose Karushara, says Not So<BR>Innocent, had their sons as their drivers and partners in<BR>crimes. Many of these young men were prominent killers in<BR>their own right, but the reputation of their mothers as<BR>fierce killers heightened their standing among the militia.<BR>&quot;Their status provided them easy access to ammunition and<BR>gave them additional opportunities to kill, abduct, loot and<BR>rape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The extent to which women took an active role in the<BR>killings is unprecedented anywhere in the world,&quot; the report<BR>further claims.<BR>This is not accidental. &quot;The architects of the holocaust<BR>sought to involve as much of the population as possible to create a nation of extremists bound together by the blood<BR>men, women and even children as young as eight. They set out<BR>of genocide. If everyone was involved - directly or<BR>indirectly - there would be no one to point an accusing<BR>finger at.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not all women participated of course, and neither did all<BR>men. Many women, as well as many men, refused to kill and<BR>took risks to save their friends, colleagues and neighbours.<BR>But thousands of other women sided with the male killers, as<BR>willing participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of educated women were known as extremists long<BR>before April 1994. For them, the genocide was an opportunity<BR>to contribute to the &quot;final solution.&quot; Some others succumbed,<BR>like men, because of fear and pressure, or because of the<BR>deeply-ingrained habit in Rwanda of obeying official orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others were motivated by greed; they believed the promises<BR>of politicians, ideologues, journalists and local government<BR>officials that those who killed would receive material<BR>rewards, such as inheriting the land of Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women contributed to the massacres and killings in a<BR>variety of ways, narrates the report. Some killed with their<BR>own hands. One of the attacks against refugees driven to the<BR>hilltop of Kabuye in Ndora, Butare, was led by a pregnant<BR>former gendarme, Felicitee Semakuba. &quot;Kneeling,&quot; says the<BR>report, &quot;she shot at thousands of unarmed people and threw<BR>grenades at them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women told killers where people were hiding, screaming out<BR>their names as the terrified quarry ran for their lives. Some<BR>women provided the petrol with which people were burnt alive.<BR>Other women and girls were seen at roadblocks, checking ID<BR>cards, a prelude to the slaughter of thousands of people<BR>&quot;incriminated&quot; by the fact that their IDs said &quot;Tutsi&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also the crowds that surrounded churches, hospitals and<BR>other places of refuge wielding machetes, nail-studded clubs<BR>and spears included women.<BR>Women particularly excelled as &quot;cheerleaders&quot; of the<BR>genocide, singing and ululating the killers into action. They<BR>entered churches, schools, football stadiums and hospitals to<BR>finish off the wounded, hacking women, children and even men<BR>to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their victims included their neighbours as well as<BR>strangers whom they stripped of all belongings. Some women<BR>have even been accused of killing their own husbands and<BR>children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both educated women and peasants identified the people to<BR>be killed, pointing out who was a Tutsi, or an &quot;unreliable&quot;<BR>Hutu on account of their politically moderate views, the<BR>report asserts.<BR>It adds: &quot;Educated women, made lists of people to be killed<BR>which they gave to the soldiers, militia and local government<BR>officials organising the genocide. Many women also refused to<BR>shelter the hunted and kicked people out of their homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The few women who occupied positions in the civil<BR>administration were among the very worst killers. Women like<BR>Odette Nyirabagenzi, Rose Karushara and Euphrasie Kamatumu,<BR>councilors in Kigali, are personally responsible for the<BR>death of thousands of people, many of them killed with a<BR>brutality that defies credibility.<BR>&quot;Their homes became headquarters for the militia,&quot; the report<BR>charges adding that: &quot;They distributed weapons and ammunition<BR>and took an active part in selecting men and boys who were<BR>taken out of churches to be massacred.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rose Karushara, a tall strong woman, is said to have<BR>beaten up the refugees before handing them over to the<BR>militia for the final kill. She was frequently at the<BR>roadblocks in her sector, deciding on whether refugees should<BR>be killed or allowed to live. Women in the media also played<BR>a leading role in the massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But perhaps most shocking is the revelation that &quot;some<BR>nuns are remembered in Rwanda&quot; for their involvement in the<BR>1994 genocide. These include two nuns currently being<BR>sheltered in a monastery in Maredret, Belgium. Sister<BR>Gertrude Mukangango, the Mother Superior in the convent at<BR>the Monastery of Sovu in Butare and Sister Julienne Kizito<BR>from the same convent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sisters closed their door to the refugees and drove<BR>out those who had forced their way in, fully aware of the<BR>killings around them. Many of the refugees they drove out,<BR>including immediate family members of Tutsi Sisters at the<BR>convent, were murdered immediately after they left the<BR>convent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sister Julienne, Not So Innocent alleges, is reported to<BR>have worked directly with the killers, standing in their<BR>midst while they massacred refugees, handing out jerrycans of<BR>petrol which were used in her presence, to burn people alive,<BR>including a Tutsi employee of her own convent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She is also accused of distributing belongings of the<BR>refugees to &quot;the criminals with whom she collaborated.&quot; &quot;The<BR>two nuns worked closely with all the leading killers in their<BR>commune,&quot; the report adds. The Africa Rights report says that<BR>a significant number of female doctors and nurses supported<BR>the killers. They identified their Tutsi colleagues to the<BR>killers, provided them with lists of Tutsi patients and<BR>betrayed their hiding places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report further describes the role of other women<BR>professionals: &quot;Women Government ministers, civil servants,<BR>local academics, school teachers, school inspectors,<BR>students, housewives, domestic servants, traders, nuns and<BR>the staff of local NGOs and employees of international<BR>agencies were all involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, the report names one of the best known women<BR>killers as Angeline Mukandutiye, a school inspector in<BR>Kigali. She regularly visited the refugees at the churches of<BR>St Famille and St Paul's, choosing which ones would be<BR>killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not So Innocent concludes by stressing the importance of<BR>documenting and exposing women's participation in the<BR>killings, failure of which would reinforce the impunity that<BR>is enjoyed by genocidal criminals.<BR>The report laments that: &quot;Many of the women named in the<BR>report, and countless others whose crimes remain to be<BR>exposed, are living in comfortable exile in Africa and in<BR>Europe. Some have been employed by international<BR>organisations in the camps for refugees in Zaire, Tanzania<BR>and Burundi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until a few weeks ago, Angeline Mukandutiye was working<BR>for Medicin Sans Frontier (MSF) Holland in Goma in their<BR>mental health programme. Pauline Nyiramusuhuko is in charge<BR>of social services in a camp in Bukavu run by Caritas<BR>International, and has responsibility for unaccompanied<BR>children.<BR>But under the general label of &quot;innocence&quot; some of these<BR>women return to reclaim their property, at the same time<BR>providing information for their men folk on their<BR>reconnaissance visits. Hence the urgent need to expose<BR>killers among the women who use the &quot;innocence label&quot; as a<BR>front for men and further mischief .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - Pope John Paul's 11th trip to Africa which<BR>starts on Thursday September 14, will arguably be his most<BR>important visit to the African continent where some 95<BR>million Catholics live. The trip has aroused great<BR>expectations because the Pope is due to release the results<BR>of the controversial African Synod that was held in Rome last<BR>year. The Pope's 15-page &quot;exhortations&quot; will chart the course<BR>that the Catholic Church will follow into the 21st Century.<BR>The hope of many faithful in Africa is that the<BR>&quot;exhortations&quot; will permit an authentic expression of African<BR>spirituality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the Pope announces the results of the African Synod<BR>in Yaounde, Cameroon; Johannesburg, South Africa and Nairobi,<BR>Kenya during his tour of Africa this September, it will be<BR>the culmination of 18 years of debate and preparation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Synod itself opened in Rome on April 10, 1994 and<BR>involved interaction of more than 300 people comprising<BR>mostly of African Bishops, missionary and religious<BR>superiors. A number of theological observers and a few women<BR>also attended the Synod.<BR>To sort out the materials, documents and issues into a form<BR>acceptable to the &quot;Supreme Magesterium&quot; of the Church has<BR>taken just over a year. Hundreds of African Bishops from<BR>central and eastern Africa will be in Nairobi to welcome the<BR>Pope on 18 and 19 September at the conclusion of yet another<BR>African tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the Pope would travel to Africa was confirmed earlier<BR>this year. The purpose of the visit would be to present the<BR>results of the Synod on the African soil, at least to allay<BR>fears that the holding of so significant an event in Rome<BR>last year amounted to a vote of no confidence in the maturity<BR>of the African Church.<BR>One of the earliest critics of the Rome venue for the Synod<BR>was Father Sesana Kizito, former editor of the New People, a<BR>Catholic monthly published by the Comboni Missionaries in<BR>Nairobi. He lost his job late last year, a clear signal that<BR>&quot;in Rome someone is not able to accept that within the Church<BR>there may be some legitimate different ideas and experiences<BR>on how to incarnate the Gospel in Africa today.&quot;<BR>Fr. Kizito observes that the holding of the Synod in Rome is<BR>now &quot;a fact of history - it is already done.&quot; He sees the<BR>Pope's current visit to Africa as an expression of a wish to<BR>have some connection with the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Had the Synod taken place in Africa &quot;it would have been a<BR>sign of recognition by the Vatican that the African Church<BR>had grown sufficiently and was able to chart its destiny.&quot;<BR>In many countries in Africa, particularly war or violence<BR>torn countries like Sudan, Angola, Mozambique, Liberia,<BR>Sierra Leone and South Africa, the grassroots never really<BR>took part in the process that led to the Synod or the<BR>&quot;Special Assembly&quot; for Africa.<BR> A document from East Africa calls on the Catholic Church not<BR>to be afraid of African culture and traditions. &quot;If the<BR>Church can shed its fears, very real progress is possible in<BR>many areas covered during the Assembly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been some solid progress in the Church since the<BR>pace setting Vatican II Council documents were published<BR>thirty years ago. For example nowadays people take for<BR>granted the use of local languages in Mass. It used to be<BR>exclusively Latin. African musical instruments and rhythmic<BR>singing are now accepted almost everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In countries like Zambia and a few others one need not<BR>choose a Saint's name for baptism. A candidate can be<BR>baptised any African or other name of his or her choice. This<BR>incorporation of African cultural values into the message of<BR>the Gospel, was one of the key themes of the Synod.<BR>&quot;The path towards inculturation has already been cleared by<BR>the Supreme Megesterium of the Church,&quot; says Bishop<BR>Rakotondravahatra of Madagascar. There was really no need for<BR>further campaigns to urge its necessity, he observes. People<BR>should get on with the work, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The establishment of the voluntary Small Christian<BR>Communities (SCCs) comprising of local parishioners at<BR>grassroots level is one area where the Church is chalking up<BR>good progress, thanks to the dedication of AMECEA Bishops to<BR>the concept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AMECEA is the Association of Member Episcopal Conferences<BR>in Eastern and Central Africa. Headquartered in Nairobi,<BR>AMECEA covers Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi,<BR>Zambia and Sudan.<BR>According to Father Joseph Healey, an American Missionary and<BR>adopted son of an African clan (the Mbogo-buffalo-clan of the<BR>Baganda tribe of Uganda) there are at least 13,000 SCCs in<BR>Eastern and Central Africa.<BR>The SCCs are the result of local initiatives by neighbours in<BR>a parish. They involve participants often from families, who<BR>meet regularly, for prayer, interaction and biblical sharing<BR>in the tradition of the extended African family. Members<BR>address themselves to local and other social issues affecting<BR>their locality or and their families, and their church and<BR>parish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They may care for each other in times of crises such as<BR>illness. Together with lay preachers they serve as an<BR>important function in evangelisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Father Healey has documented cases where members of an SCC<BR>take turns to care for the gravely ill including AIDS<BR>patients. They have also resolved marriage problems among<BR>their members.<BR>Because they cut across the scope of the key themes of the<BR>Synod, like Evangelism, Peace and Justice, AIDS awareness and<BR>nursing, and Family integrity, SCCs will be critical in<BR>furthering the goals of the Synod.<BR>Father Kizito and Healey believe the SCCs have not fulfilled<BR>their potential. &quot;The right direction depends on the<BR>initiative of the local Bishop&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African Synod in Rome coincided with the genocide in<BR>Rwanda, a country that is largely Catholic. Priests, nuns,<BR>Bishops and millions of otherwise level-headed Christians<BR>have been implicated in this African holocaust. Where was the<BR>Blood of Christ in all this?<BR>Bishop Bernard Budidira of Burundi observes that for<BR>Christianity to take true root, people in Africa have to<BR>learn to &quot;interiorize&quot; the Gospel, to turn it into a living<BR>force in their lives. Bishop Obiefuna of Nigeria asserts that<BR>&quot;the blood of the tribe should not be thicker than the water<BR>of Baptism&quot;. On their face value, these are simple and clear<BR>statements, but they confirm that Christianity in Africa<BR>remains superficial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked by the press whether Christianity had failed in<BR>Africa with regard to the genocide in Rwanda, Rev. Jose Belo<BR>Chipenda, General Secretary of the Nairobi-based All Africa<BR>Conference of Churches (AACC) said &quot;Christianity had neither<BR>been tried nor lived.&quot;<BR>Chipenda's answer further confirms the superficiality of<BR>Christianity in Africa, where the quest for personal<BR>salvation has tended to be pursued in isolation of the<BR>biblical teaching: &quot;Love God above All Things and your<BR>Neighbour as Yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How did the Synod and how will the Pope address this<BR>problem and save a continent that cries out desperately for<BR>love, peace and justice?<BR>A recurring criticism of the Synod was that far too few<BR>African theologians (Lay theologians) were in attendance in<BR>Rome. One explanation is a perceived distrust between the<BR>Clergy and theologians. The latter often want to see the<BR>Church free itself from uniformity and hierarchism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Father Kizito believes that theologians who are over<BR>critical and radical are the exception in Africa. &quot;It is<BR>unreasonable for anybody to be afraid of them; in any case<BR>even those who are critical are faithful to their Church&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kizito sees African theologians as key players in the post<BR>Synod interpretation of the Pope's exhortations.<BR>In the indigenous Pentecostal Churches, women play pivotal<BR>roles and sometimes initiate such Churches themselves. In<BR>traditional African societies the &quot;penalisation and<BR>marginalisation&quot; of women in major decision making has been a<BR>major hindrance to social progress.<BR>During the last Synod on Religious Life held in Rome in<BR>October last year, Monsignor Kombo of Brazzavile spoke for<BR>women when he said there is need for greater participation by<BR>women at higher levels of decision making within the catholic<BR>Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What have the Pope's exhortations have to say about<BR>women's participation in the Church especially that he is<BR>touring Africa after the UN Conference on Women in Beijing,<BR>China?<BR>The Vatican has already given indications that the major<BR>thrust of the Pope's declarations will revolve around the<BR>Family. Certainly, vexed issues like polygamy, healing,<BR>celibacy of the clergy and many more will be relegated to a<BR>file for future consideration and study. Nevertheless the<BR>Pope's exhortations may spring some surprises as the Church<BR>enters the Third Millenum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever the Pope's message, Father Kizito says it will be<BR>the beginning. &quot;The Pope is likely to give general direction<BR>and guidelines but the actual work of building the Church millions of faithful in Africa.&quot;<BR>that will be the work of the bishops, the priests and the<BR>In some countries they are getting on with the task more<BR>vigorously than in others. For example in Uganda and<BR>Zimbabwe, many customary elements of burial ceremonies have<BR>been incorporated in the Catholic funeral rite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Father Kizito makes the bold statement that in future &quot;all<BR>Sacraments will be celebrated with African symbols&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>September 20, 1995<BR>by Wafula John</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - In traditional and much of rural Africa even<BR>today, age was associated with wisdom and respect. But as the<BR>continent gets more concerned with gender issues and street<BR>children, the elderly-poor in the streets of the &quot;mad&quot; urban<BR>areas remain uncared for. Many of today's elderly pavement<BR>dwellers spent most of their productive years either doing<BR>odd jobs or as street urchins themselves, who now have<BR>multiplied more than ten times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New Stanley is a five star hotel in downtown Nairobi. But<BR>that has not stopped Peter Gakuru 73, from &quot;setting up shop&quot;<BR>on a pavement next to the hotel, a popular spot for tourists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Married to blind Milka Wanjiku and with four children to<BR>fend for, Gakuru's sole income for the last five years has<BR>been alms from well-wishers of the streets. Gakuru is part of<BR>the growing number of elderly people who are increasingly<BR>depending on Nairobi's streets to barely survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When I was able-bodied,&quot; says haggard Gakuru, I used to<BR>carry loads for a living. Today I can't.&quot; But at least Gakuru<BR>has a &quot;home&quot; and family to return to after a day's &quot;labour.&quot;<BR>Hapless Mary Wangui Kararie, 62, has lived on Nairobi's<BR>streets since 1991 with occasional stints in a friend's Chuom<BR>in the sprawling Mathare valley. &quot;Chuoms&quot; are makeshift<BR>polythene paper and carton box &quot;homes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What brought Wangui on the streets? &quot;Hunger,&quot; she says<BR>curtly. Her only child and sole bread winner, Jane Wanjiru, a<BR>mother of two, died in a road accident five years ago. Wangui<BR>had only one choice to make: together with her two small<BR>grand children they took to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The children were later rescued by the Undugu Society, a<BR>philanthropic organization started by Rev. Father Arnold Grol<BR>in 1972. Undugu Society assists disadvantaged children<BR>through, among other programmes, an educational programme<BR>duped &quot;education for life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mary Wangui was left to battle it out on her &quot;pavement<BR>home&quot; upon which thousands of feet tread. Nairobi's night<BR>temperatures often plunge as low as six degrees Celsius. In<BR>addition, Wangui has been alternately arrested for being &quot;a<BR>vagabond&quot; and terrorised by &quot;street urchins&quot; and other night<BR>street idlers and thieves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of aging people drifting onto Nairobi's streets<BR>is growing by the day. Paul Kilonzo, 55, &quot;set up a stand&quot; on<BR>a pavement in a middle class residential estate early this<BR>year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A former hawker, Kilonzo found to his embarrassment that<BR>he could not raise enough money to neither pay rent for a<BR>shack and to feed his family of three sons. He also found it<BR>difficult to resume his hawking business after a two year<BR>stint in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It broke my heart the first day I took this corner as a<BR>beggar,&quot; says Kilonzo. &quot;I wept with bitterness that I had<BR>come so low. To date, I bow down in shame whenever I see a<BR>person who knew me in better days,&quot; says Kilonzo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why can't he take up any job that comes his way? None<BR>comes his way, laments Kilonzo. Worse still, he has been<BR>sickly since he left jail. He chooses not to disclose why he<BR>went to prison in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indes Wambui, about 70, once peddled basketfuls of farm<BR>produce from door to door in residential estates to eke out a<BR>living. Now she solicits for copper and silver coins to live<BR>on at a pavement opposite Parliament Buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Wambui, it is a one-person but vain crusade, to prompt<BR>reluctant Kenyan legislators to debate the plight of her<BR>likes including today's &quot;street children and petty traders<BR>who are potential elderly pavement beggars and dwellers of<BR>the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, all she has managed in three years on the streets<BR>is to draw the attention of security officers whenever<BR>parliament resumes, when she is scurried off the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obviously gone are the days when blindness, cripplehood<BR>and deafness were the sole driving forces of the aging<BR>towards city streets. Agnes Syombua, 50, was driven to the<BR>streets five years ago by her blindness and abject poverty.<BR>But Mary Njeri, about 80, set up her &quot;begging stand&quot; next to<BR>the luxury Norfolk Hotel last year because nobody cared for<BR>her any more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My husband died during the MAU war of liberation, I have<BR>nobody to take care of me. Nobody cares about me,&quot; laments<BR>Njeri, a former vegetable vendor. The extended family system<BR>can not help her because many now consider it as<BR>&quot;burdensome&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The multiplying number of elderly &quot;retirees&quot; on Nairobi's<BR>streets reflects the rapid emission of cultural values in the<BR>Kenyan society. &quot;Modernism has deprived our society of<BR>cultural bonds which tied us to the aged and made them useful<BR>senior citizens,&quot; says Mr. Otinda Okeng'o, a leading scholar<BR>in population studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In reality, Kenyans are sliding into &quot;sheer selfishness<BR>often epitomised in our hysterical embracing of the nuclear<BR>family and other Western values,&quot; Mr. Okeng'o says adding<BR>that: In the name of modernisation the extended family system<BR>which catered for the aged, orphans, disabled and refugees is<BR>dying rapidly. &quot;Those who should be repositories of our<BR>culture and provide the link between our past and the future<BR>are today painfully wasting away on our unsafe streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With growing individualism coupled with economic<BR>hardships, and the urban drift of young breadwinners in<BR>search of better living conditions, the &quot;comforting extended<BR>family&quot; is down for the count. This leaves the aging in<BR>danger of neglect and even total abandonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Writing about a Kenyan ethnic group with regard to a past<BR>communal enterprise, a prominent Kenyan journalist, Philip<BR>Ochieng had this to say: &quot;The go-getting individualism with<BR>which capitalism has imbued them now solidly stands in the<BR>way of any enterprise with any mere whiff of gentle<BR>communalism. Individuals now invest resources only in<BR>ventures which yield returns to them as individuals and in<BR>which they have a measure of control in accounting.&quot; Given<BR>this scenario, the future doesn't look any brighter for the<BR>aged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1990 about half a billion people world-wide were more<BR>than 60 years of age. This figure is expected to rise to 1.4<BR>billion by the year 2000. Most of these aging people will be<BR>in the Third World, Averting the Old Age Crisis, a World Bank<BR>study says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The future is set to be even more bleak for the increasing<BR>number of the aging in Africa . With family planning<BR>advocates, and especially the electronic media, bent on<BR>extolling the virtues of &quot;the two children family&quot;,<BR>&quot;grannies&quot; are set to be distanced even further. Worse still,<BR>the effects of the Structural Adjustment Programmes have<BR>tended to impoverish the average African making him<BR>concentrate more on the survival of his or her immediate<BR>family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even more distressing, ironical as it may sound, is the<BR>fact that Africa's heavy investment in population control and<BR>child survival programmes for the last three decades is now<BR>bearing fruit. In Kenya for example, according to the current<BR>National Development Plan, the country's fertility rate<BR>declined from 15 per cent to 6.7 per cent between 1979 and<BR>1987 and stood at 5.4 per cent in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These figures put Kenya's population in a new development<BR>stage where there is an accelerated aging of the people. By<BR>the year 2005 there will be more Kenyans above the age of 40<BR>than there will be below. This means that there will be more<BR>&quot;older people&quot; than the young as opposed to today's trend<BR>where the young are more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the drift of Kenya's aging towards urban pavements<BR>gathers speed, there is urgent need for the current &quot;able&quot;<BR>generation to plan seriously and provide security to these<BR>senior citizens. It won't be long before they too &quot;age&quot;, get<BR>neglected or are unceremoniously abandoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This flow towards the streets is a mere tip of the iceberg<BR>of the present socio-cultural and political situation on the<BR>African continent. It is a testimony that there are many more<BR>miserable Kenyans, aged or not, tacked somewhere in rural and<BR>suburban hideouts without the courage, energy or<BR>&quot;opportunity&quot; to go on the streets.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>September 20, 1995<BR>by Dingaan Mpondah</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - In much of Africa today, the Church remains the<BR>most effective grassroots organisation that is capable of<BR>swaying its followers -- rural or urban, educated or<BR>illiterate -- one way or the other, for good or for worse.<BR>And so when churches or sects that exploited or confused the<BR>&quot;gullible masses&quot; agree to reform, the occasion calls for<BR>some concessions just as the Zimbabwean authorities appear<BR>set to do with regard to the country's Apostolic Churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe's independence in 1980 coincided, or indeed<BR>inspired, a new boom. Numerous followers from some of the<BR>country's established churches began to breakaway in<BR>increasing numbers to form their own churches or sects.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a television interview in May 1987, the then Minister<BR>of Home Affairs, Enos Nkala, attacked the newly- formed<BR>&quot;dubious&quot; churches which he said were exploiting the<BR>&quot;gullible masses&quot; in the country. The most callous aspect of<BR>some of these and other churches or sects is that they<BR>refused to have anything to do with vaccination of their offIn one incident during a seven-day immunisation campaign<BR>springs.<BR>against the six killer diseases -- measles, whooping cough,<BR>diphtheria, polio, tuberculosis and tetanus -- scores of<BR>members of the Johanne Masowe Apostolic Church in Ngezi town<BR>simply went into hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not known how children that were deliberately denied<BR>immunisation in those years have fared since. Today, however,<BR>their counterparts born after July 1995, and their parents<BR>have a reason to smile. But that is if their churches are<BR>part of the Council of the Apostolic Churches in Zimbabwe<BR>(CACZ).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council which groups together 23 different sects have<BR>reached an understanding with the Government to abide by all<BR>requirements and regulations including sending children for<BR>treatment or vaccination. The Government has in turn promised<BR>to speed up the process of having the sects registered just<BR>like other churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CACZ used the occasion to castigate faith healers who<BR>demanded money for their services. There is in Zimbabwe<BR>today, a proliferation of faith healers, almost all of them<BR>with roots in Apostolic Churches. A spokesman of the Council<BR>referred to healers as &quot;mercenary healers&quot; who, he said, did<BR>not belong to their member churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Formed in 1994, the Council has since appealed to the<BR>Ministry of Education and Culture, now Ministry of Sports,<BR>Recreation and Culture, to have their member groups<BR>registered alongside other churches. Unregistered churches<BR>are prohibited from soliciting for donations and so are<BR>unable to engage in charitable activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other than the Apostolic Holiness Pentecostal Church and a<BR>few others, most Apostolic groups in Zimbabwe have no proper<BR>church buildings or sites. Their prayer meetings are<BR>conducted in open spaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this does not go down well with the requirements of<BR>public health authorities. The groups are, therefore, also<BR>asking national housing and public construction officials to<BR>assist them get land on which to build their churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Government is said to be ready to help the CACZ as<BR>long as the members observe the country's laws and other<BR>requirements. Registration can only be assured if the sects<BR>desisted from undesirable practices such as barring children<BR>from attending school and attending preventive or curative<BR>clinics, a ministry spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a meeting held in Chitungwiza, about 30 kilometres<BR>south of Harare, on July 20, Sebastian Chihera, vicesecretary for the Ministry of Sports, Recreation and Culture<BR>chairman of the CACZ, assured Mark Nkiwane, acting deputy<BR>that the churches would co-operate with the Government as far<BR>as possible in matters affecting them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Times are changing and we all see the need to change with<BR>them. We will do our best to make sure that we operate within<BR>the country's laws. Education and treatment in hospitals are<BR>things we should not deprive our children. Elders can be left<BR>to decide for themselves but children should be treated when<BR>it is necessary,&quot; said Mr. Chihera. Mr. Nkiwane said the<BR>Government would attend to the churches requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apostolic churches and many other sects have many times<BR>been at crossroads with the Government for one reason or<BR>another. One of the most notorious of these churches was led<BR>by a mysterious tall black man - &quot;Va Jesu&quot; (&quot;The Christ&quot;),<BR>who in the mid and late 1980s, claimed to be the<BR>reincarnation of Jesus Christ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another equally notorious sect was called Wapusa Wapusa<BR>(Wake Up in Shona). Both sects were set up in 1986 and were<BR>confined to the countryside, mainly in the central and northVa Jesu was a very wealthy man who owned six large farming<BR>west regions.<BR>estates and a chain of business enterprises including<BR>supermarkets and flourishing grinding mills. He was always<BR>accompanied by twelve young &quot;apostles&quot; - six male and six<BR>female - and had thousands of fanatic followers who seemed to<BR>be under a hypnotic spell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The man died about four years ago. Nothing much has been<BR>heard about his church lately. His sect is also presumed<BR>dead. Most of Va Jesu's farms were forfeited to the State as<BR>no one could give an account as to how he had acquired that<BR>vast wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wapusa Wapusa, on the other hand was more obscure and<BR>secretive. It conducted its &quot;services&quot; in places wellabout&quot; the faith was that all its services were nocturnal and<BR>concealed from the public. What was &quot;totally unacceptable<BR>word ran around that before anybody was allowed to attend,<BR>they had to undress completely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Minister Nkala told newsmen in the television<BR>interview that he had instructed the police to investigate<BR>&quot;questionable churches&quot; Wapusa Wapusa went underground. It is<BR>speculated that Wapusa Wapusa could still be alive although<BR>nothing much is heard about the sect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Some of the churches have unscrupulous leaders who<BR>instruct their followers to do what is in direct opposition<BR>to Christian teachings. They find employment in lying about<BR>God, and cause divorces by their very teachings. Law<BR>enforcement agents will have to come in because these<BR>churches are illegal,&quot; said Nkala.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - Leadership crisis is listed as one of the many<BR>debilitating crises afflicting the African continent, where<BR>the governed and their governments do not usually move handbook simply titled &quot;Leadership&quot; the author offers some<BR>in-hand in the promotion of the common good. In a 524-page<BR>practical guidelines towards developing and exercising<BR>leadership abilities that could prove particularly useful to<BR>the continent's, political, business, community and church<BR>leaders. Though published in 1989, some six years ago, the<BR>book remains a relevant companion to those who wish to lead<BR>effectively and honour their Creator in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book &quot;Leadership&quot; is primarily a practical guide for<BR>leadership and effective management in a Christian context.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seeks to challenge people who are &quot;willing to dream and<BR>help them to fulfill those dreams.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the book the words of the author, he wants to &quot;help you<BR>to develop and to exercise your leadership abilities so that<BR>you not only dream big, but you think big, plan big, and act<BR>big, and in doing all this, you honour Jesus Christ in the<BR>whole process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The author, Anthony D'Souza, is a native of Bombay, India.<BR>He is eminently qualified by his training, professional<BR>experience and his total commitment to Christ to be a leader<BR>anywhere in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His lectures on Leadership and Management Skills at the<BR>famous Haggai Institute, have become a part of the vital<BR>ongoing training programme at the Institute. Anthony D'Souza<BR>is a Catholic priest of the Order of the Society of Jesus<BR>(S.J.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is a former Director of the Indian Social Institute,<BR>New Delhi, and Rector of St. Xavier's College in Bombay. He<BR>has also been chaplain of the Association of Christian<BR>Executives (ACE) in India and Director of the Xavier<BR>Institute of Management and professor of Organisational<BR>Behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book is a three-in-one volume. But the author has<BR>creatively structured the text to ensure a lively, steady and<BR>easy reading. For a serious reader, the book is also easy to<BR>comprehend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The author uses a variety of techniques which include<BR>active discussions, verse, personal experiences and<BR>observations, and illustrations in form of cartoons and<BR>diagrams to liven up the text. He also ensures the reader<BR>participates throughout the text by brainstorming him or her<BR>(the reader) with interesting thought- provoking questions.<BR>After each major topic there is a self-evaluating or a selfIn Volume I, the book provides materials on being a<BR>assessing exercise.<BR>leader. This volume is offered to enhance greater selfIn this part of the book, the author discusses issues such<BR>confidence and the leader's own ability or potential.<BR>as the key functions and skills of leadership; impact of<BR>contrasting leadership styles, improving interpersonal<BR>relations; communicating and getting feedback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Volume II which is on leading others, offers practical<BR>basic methods for a leader to lead better. In this volume the<BR>author discusses team dynamics, interaction and building;<BR>developing surbodinates through coaching, counseling and<BR>motivation, and on mastering the dynamics of planned change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the third volume the reader is introduced to the role<BR>of a leader as an individual, and how leadership skills can<BR>be developed. This section gives guidelines on how to manage<BR>time, set goals and look ahead leading others effectively.<BR>Fr. Anthony D'Souza S.J. also deals with work-related stress<BR>and &quot;burnout&quot; in this section. He concludes with the concept<BR>of delegation and on developing a winning attitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fr. D'Souza S.J. addresses rather succinctly issues such<BR>as training skills, planning, time management, conflict<BR>resolving, team building and dynamics, delegation and<BR>motivation from a Third World perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, while in Africa the critical phrase &quot;this is<BR>African time&quot; is only laughed at, in the book, Leadership,<BR>the importance of time management is rightly perceived as a<BR>prerequisite for any meaningful achievement to take place.<BR>Time wasting is not only costly but also a sin. The author<BR>explains the &quot;Parieto&quot; time principle and shows the leader<BR>how to prioritise tasks or work, to achieve better time<BR>management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On motivation, the author explains the application of<BR>Maslow's Needs Hierarchy and the Fredrick Herzberg Two-Factor<BR>theory. This section aims to teach a leader to appreciate<BR>when and how to give a &quot;pat on the back&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a concluding note Fr. D'Souza S.J. outlines the<BR>qualities of effective leadership as: Tolerance, optimism,<BR>integrity, sincerity, knowledge and understanding,<BR>decisiveness, concern for others, openness, communication,<BR>good example, patience and courage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is the hope of the author that leaders and potential or<BR>future leaders will be able to master the art of leadership<BR>after reading this book.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1094 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>September 20, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GENEVA - The spirit of racism is still &quot;well and alive&quot; in<BR>South Africa, Rev. Frank Chikane, former General Secretary of<BR>the South African Council of Churches (SACC) has said, adding<BR>that the second phase of the struggle in his country had just<BR>begun. He described this as the phase when those who were<BR>excluded by apartheid can be included in reconstructing and<BR>restructuring the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his address to the 150-member Central Committee of the<BR>WCC, Rev. Chikane was emphatic that racism in South Africa<BR>did not end with the installation of the African National<BR>Congress (ANC) government of President Nelson Mandela. The<BR>last WCC Central Committee meeting was held in Johannesburg,<BR>South Africa in January 1994, when Chikane was still SACC<BR>General Secretary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Racism in South Africa has not ended but is suppressed by<BR>the democratic process that is in place. The political power<BR>(of racism) is gone but the economic power is still in the<BR>places where it was before,&quot; Chikane said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He reminded Central Committee members that the church in<BR>South Africa was the first to globalise the evils of, and the<BR>struggle against apartheid culminating in the current<BR>democratic process in the country. He challenged Committee<BR>members that concerted efforts with even more vigor were<BR>needed to fight racism now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Apartheid was an obvious monster, racism is not, racism<BR>is still alive in South Africa, racism is still alive in the<BR>church,&quot; he added. The former SACC General Secretary likened<BR>the programme that freed South Africa from the yoke of<BR>apartheid as a time that &quot;God chose to speak to us about<BR>racism throughout the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rev. Frank Chikane's provoking address to the 46th WCC<BR>Central Committee meeting here (September 14-22) was inspired<BR>by the WCC framework document on racism drafted by the<BR>organisation's Unit III, Justice, Peace and Creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I want to be treated like a human being so that I do not<BR>fight stupid wars everywhere I am,&quot; Chikane told a plenary<BR>assembly here in reference to the number of times he has been<BR>subjected to thorough searches at European airports &quot;simply<BR>because I am black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WCC framework document summarises the ecumenical<BR>history and the current challenges in the struggle to<BR>eradicate racism. The document examines WCC's understanding<BR>of racism, root causes, subsequent effects, and its (racism)<BR>relationship to global trend in three phases: pre-1968, 1968Throughout the document, key questions are raised to<BR>1980 and 1990 to the present.<BR>stimulate reflection and further discussion. The paper also<BR>examines some of the current dilemmas in relation to focusing<BR>WCC actions against racism and suggests that it is time to<BR>embark on a fourth phase. It singles out issues to be<BR>addressed as, overt as opposed to covert manifestations, the<BR>relationship between various &quot;issues&quot; and new consciousness<BR>of white racism and the role played by &quot;elite&quot; groups in the<BR>South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On overt versus covert racism, the document notes that<BR>much of WCC's work in the struggle against racism<BR>concentrated on campaigns against apartheid. South Africa<BR>epitomized white power and privilege over marginalised<BR>oppressed blacks (Africans, Indians and so called coloureds).<BR>The paper goes on to say that, apartheid was easy to<BR>understand; its overt manifestations of invited an ecumenical<BR>response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, however, notes the draft document, there are still<BR>cases of overt racism. There are also more subtle covert<BR>expressions of racism. Covert racism is not so easy to<BR>understand, explain or counteract because its manifestations<BR>are less obvious and can be easily denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African clergy pointed out that goodwill alone<BR>would not change the situation particularly in South Africa.<BR>On the economic empowerment of the majority, he noted, &quot;about<BR>70 per cent of the people in South Africa do not qualify to<BR>get a loan from the bank, they are a bad risk.&quot; But despite<BR>these odds, the people in South Africa are determined to root<BR>out racism. However, the question &quot;still remains, can we do<BR>it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As long as Africa remains where it is and there is no<BR>dramatic change, I will be treated like this endlessly. For<BR>change to happen in a dramatic way, we need more concerted<BR>efforts,&quot; he concluded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>September 20, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LONDON - The World Bank will cancel the debt owed to it by<BR>a small group of countries mainly in sub-Sahara Africa, Dr.<BR>Jeffry Lamb, senior executive of the World largest lending<BR>institution here has said. Lamb did not reveal the countries<BR>in question, but said the move would help them overcome<BR>persistent economic crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked why the World Bank was taking this step at this time<BR>after years of rejecting pleas by developing nations that<BR>their debt repayments were impoverishing their nations, Dr.<BR>Lamb conceded that the Bank had now accepted critics' views<BR>that the debt burden had become a cause of economic<BR>unsustainability for the small group of countries which are<BR>being offered relief. But as a condition for the relief, he<BR>said, the World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF), would<BR>continually monitor performance of the beneficiary countries<BR>to ensure that they stick to the institutions' prescriptions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Lamb emphasised that there would be no blanket relief<BR>on debt owed to the Bank by the majority of Third World<BR>nations saying &quot;such a move would endanger the World Bank's<BR>viability.&quot; Lambs statement comes only three weeks before the<BR>annual meeting of the World Bank/IMF to be held in<BR>Washington, USA, in the second week of October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also comes amidst growing pressure from churches, both<BR>in Africa, and Europe and America, for reforms in the lending<BR>policies of the World Bank/IMF. The churches want lending<BR>policies that have &quot;a human face&quot;, free of some of the<BR>austerity measures that have burdened the poorest of the poor<BR>in the debtor nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already according to the Washington Correspondent of the<BR>Daily Nation in Nairobi, 30 religious groups in the United<BR>States have responded to a call issued by the All Africa<BR>Conference of Churches (AACC) in Nairobi and have formed a<BR>coalition to press for the changes at the top in the<BR>IMF/World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ecumenical coalition, the Religious Working Group on<BR>the World Bank/IMF includes Methodist, Unitarian, Mennonite,<BR>Baptist, Episcopal, United Church of Christ, Christian Church<BR>(Disciples of Christ), Catholic and secular organisations,<BR>institutions and individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to sponsoring a public rally in Washington on<BR>October 9, the Religious Working Group will organise forums<BR>wherein they will present alternatives to IMF designed<BR>austerity programmes prescribed for scores of Third World<BR>countries. &quot;The key objective of these activities is to force<BR>the issue of large scale African debt relief onto the agenda<BR>of the World Bank/IMF,&quot; reports Kevin Kelly from Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Lamb's announcement follows an earlier decision by the<BR>World Bank to make available US dollars 200 million as loans<BR>for small scale enterprises in Africa, Asia, and Latin<BR>America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the officer in charge of the new<BR>Microfinances Division at the World Bank, Ms. Malhotra,<BR>thousands of small scale enterprises will benefit from the<BR>scheme which will lend as little as US dollars 50, but whose<BR>lending level will be between US dollars 100 to 150.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The idea is to help small scale enterprises get access to<BR>working capital. Ordinary micro-enterprises would have to<BR>resort to the money lenders in the village who charge<BR>extortionate interest rates,&quot; Malhotra said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>September 20, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - The Pope's visit to Kenya has created division<BR>among the Kenyan Muslim community with a section of the<BR>Islamic faithful lambasting their colleagues for opposing the<BR>Pontiff's visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The division began when Sheik Ali Shee and other Muslim<BR>leaders who had been invited by the coordinator of Pope's<BR>visit, Father Stephen Okello of the Kenya Catholic<BR>Secretariat, turned down the invitation and returned the VIP<BR>Card to Fr. Okello, claiming the agenda of the visit was a<BR>provocation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interestingly, Sheikh Ali contended his change of mind was<BR>necessitated by the stand of other Muslims even though he had<BR>earlier accepted to attend as official spokesman of the<BR>Muslim community. He said he avoided the ceremony so as not<BR>to cause division among the Muslims. Sheikh Ali is the Imam<BR>of Jamia Mosque in Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What infuriated the Muslims, according to Ali Shee, was a<BR>declaration by the Catholic Church to evangelise the whole of<BR>Africa by the year 2000, something the Muslims interpreted as<BR>a declaration of war against Islam and therefore a<BR>declaration of a Cold War between the two faiths. Also cited<BR>by the opponents of the Pope's visit was the 15 century<BR>persecution of Muslims in Spain by the Catholics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, other Muslims opposed Sheik Ali's stand. Among<BR>those who rebuked him is Kenya's Assistant Minister for<BR>Information and Broadcasting, Shariff Nassir, who said Islam<BR>was for unity and not division, adding that the Quran<BR>directed all Muslims to respect other religions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also reported to have criticised Sheikh Ali Shee, is Chief<BR>Sheikh Nassor Nahdy of Mombasa who quipped that Sheik Ali<BR>Shee, had no right to speak for the Muslim community. Sheik<BR>Nadhy took a swipe at Sheik Shee's criticism of the Catholic<BR>head's visit saying the Pope had a right to visit Kenya and<BR>any other part of Africa and, therefore, his visit was not a<BR>provocation to the Muslim faith as claimed by his Nairobi<BR>counterpart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another Muslim leader from a Kibera Mosque in Nairobi also<BR>told-off Sheik Ali Shee and other Nairobi Muslim leaders for<BR>condemning and boycotting the Pope's visit. Reacting to Sheik<BR>Ali's contention, Fr. Okello told the press that what the<BR>Muslims had cited were trivial matters which did not matter<BR>today. He said the catholic Church under the current Pontiff<BR>had made tremendous concessions to all religions, including<BR>Islam and was today very accommodative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When challenged as to whether Muslims did not have the<BR>same agenda to propagate their faith, Sheik Ali Shee<BR>conceded, but added that theirs was through persuasion and<BR>not declaration as that would mean using force to Islamise<BR>the continent. &quot;Because of the declaration, we Muslims cannot<BR>sit together with the Catholics because there is no good<BR>intention from the Pope,&quot; explained Sheik Shee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically in a rare show of solidarity, the Catholic<BR>Church led by the Archbishop of Nairobi, Cardinal Maurice<BR>Otunga, and the Muslims, led by Sheik Ali Shee, came together<BR>last month in condemning what the two camps felt was not<BR>Godly. The two burnt condoms and books on sex at Uhuru Park,<BR>the venue of the Pope's open Mass during his visit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - Africa will not be marginalised in the field of<BR>&quot;Christian theology and Christian religious scholarship<BR>generally,&quot; a Ghanaian theologian, Rev. Kwame Bediako, has<BR>said adding that the church in Africa should fully embrace<BR>oral Christian theology, &quot;a spontaneous, implicit or<BR>grassroots theology which comes from where the faith lives,<BR>in the life-situation of the community faith.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I do not see much of a problem on this concept for much<BR>of the theological activity in Christian Africa is being done<BR>as oral theology (in contrast to written theology) from the<BR>living experience of Christians,&quot; stressed Rev. Dr. Bediako.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Bediako noted that following the end of the Cold War<BR>there has been much allusion to the marginalisation of<BR>Africa. Africa it has been argued will hold a less strategic<BR>place in a world no longer dominated by the ideological<BR>rivalries between East and West, between capitalism and<BR>communism, he stated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;However,&quot; said Rev. Bediako, &quot;it could be argued that one<BR>particular area where Africa will not be marginalised, is in<BR>the field of Christian theology and Christian religious<BR>scholarship generally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ghanaian theologian, who was delivering a public<BR>lecture here contended that &quot;African Christianity cannot wait<BR>for a written theology to keep pace with it.&quot; Academic<BR>theology can only come afterwards to examine our Christianity<BR>retrospectively in order to understand it, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Discussing the theme A Gospel Worth Proclaiming in Our<BR>Time: An African Initiative in Christian Theology. in a<BR>lecture organised by the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference<BR>of Churches (AACC), Dr. Bediako referred to oral theology as<BR>the &quot;theology in the open, from the pulpit, in the market<BR>place, in the home as people pray or read and discuss the<BR>scriptures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting Lamin Sanneh, another scholar in African<BR>Christianity, Bediako stressed that &quot;God was not disdainful<BR>of Africans as to be incommunicable in their languages&quot;<BR>(Sanneh, 1993:166).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> God not only imbued African cultures with eternal<BR>significance and endowed African languages with a &quot;valid<BR>carriage for the divine revelation&quot;, but also provided preas anyone who knows the origins of African Christian names<BR>Christian Africa with the idiom for Christian apprehension,<BR>for God will understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In contrast for example, to what had happened in the<BR>earlier evangelisation of Europe,&quot; he said, &quot;in Africa, the<BR>God whose name had been hallowed in indigenous languages in<BR>the pre- Christian tradition was found to be the God of the<BR>Bible, in a way that neither Zeus, nor Jupiter, nor Odin<BR>could be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oral theology, Dr. Bediako argued does not deal with an<BR>oral phase, a transition stage, on the way to the academic or<BR>written theology, which then becomes the real theology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, contrary to how theology has developed &quot;as<BR>essentially an academic discipline, an intellectual pursuit,<BR>necessarily literary, and near philosophical endeavour that<BR>requires specialist technical knowledge and skills, oral<BR>theology is not found in non-literate societies only.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We ought to speak positively, of oral, spontaneous,<BR>implicit or grassroots theology, as theology which comes from<BR>where the faith lives, in the life-situation of the community<BR>of faith,&quot; said Dr. Bediako, the current director of AkrofiTheology in Akropong-Akuapem, Ghana, said.<BR>Christaller Memorial Centre for Mission Research and Applied</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added: There is no way academic or written theology can<BR>replace this spontaneous or grassroots theology; the two are<BR>complimentary aspects of one reality. The &quot;spontaneous&quot; is<BR>the foundation of the &quot;academic&quot;. Without this vital contact<BR>with the spontaneous, grassroots theology, Dr. Bediako<BR>further argued, academic theology anywhere can become<BR>detached from the community of faith and so be not much more<BR>than an exclusive conversation carried on among the guild of<BR>scholars, and incapable of communicating life in Jesus Christ<BR>to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Introducing the speaker to the audience, the head of the<BR>Research and Development Unit of the AACC, Professor Jessie<BR>Mugambi, praised Dr. Bediako for his commitment towards<BR>&quot;Africanising or rather localising the Christian theology to<BR>respond effectively to the pastoral needs of the African<BR>people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Answering a question from the floor, Dr. Mugambi said the<BR>Church in Africa is today &quot;demanding&quot; that she must have its<BR>own theological stand-point in all matters affecting the<BR>Christian life of its followers. According to Prof. Mugambi<BR>Dr. Bediako's lecture is one of the many, the AACC intends to<BR>organise to open up an arena for theologians to come together<BR>to share and listen to theological issues, affecting the<BR>Church in its efforts to serve the faithful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MONROVIA - An outbreak of diarrhoea in Tubmanburg, Bomi<BR>County some 20 km west of Monrovia, Liberia's capital, left<BR>20 persons dead and fifteen others admitted at a government<BR>hospital in the second week of September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aid workers in Tubmanburg City said that most of the<BR>victims were women, children and the elderly whose deaths<BR>were attributed to the acute shortage of food and medicine<BR>for the past few months. In the last three months, over<BR>50,000 Bomi county residents who sought refuge in Tubmanburg<BR>have been without food and essential drugs to be able to<BR>combat any epidemic outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Since the last relief distribution several months ago,<BR>relief agencies have been slow in providing emergency relief<BR>food to the civilian population who only depend on relief aid<BR>for their survival,&quot; one of the survivals told APS in<BR>Tubmanburg City.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. George Boakai, working at the city's hospital,<BR>confirmed the epidemic outbreak. He said that the hospital<BR>recorded about 500 cases of diarrhoea in the first two weeks<BR>of the outbreak, adding that most of the victims died enroute<BR>to the hospital, a situation he described as commonplace in<BR>the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The fragile security situation in the county is hampering<BR>the free movement of civilians who are capable of finding<BR>their own food,&quot; says Dr. Boakai. They are beaten, raped, and<BR>killed in the towns and villages while in search of food, he<BR>said .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tubmanburg is about 20 km away from where the UN Observer<BR>Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) and ECOMOG, the West African<BR>peace-keeping force, reported the first cease-fire violations<BR>following the sitting of the interim six-man Council of State<BR>of Liberia (CSC) on September 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The violation was between the two factions of the United<BR>Liberation Movement of Liberia (ULIMO), ULIMO-J and K. ULIMOThe ceasefire to silence the guns in this five year old<BR>J controls Tubmanburg with a population of 50,000 people.<BR>blood bath came into effect on August 22, but the two ULIMO<BR>groups led respectively by Gen. Alhaji Kromanh (now a member<BR>of the ruling Council of State) and Gen. Roosevelt Johnson<BR>clashed again. Both sides accused the other of starting the<BR>fighting in the Lofa Bridge and Bopolu areas, about 30 km<BR>from Monrovia. Both are diamond mining towns. When it was<BR>first reported in a local daily, the UNOMIL and ECOMOG<BR>reacted sharply stating that there was no fighting, only to<BR>admit later that there was indeed fighting in the two areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile the ECOMOG peace-monitoring group announced here<BR>that the disarmament of warring factions in the country's<BR>civil conflict &quot;kicked-off&quot; just over a week after the<BR>sitting of the interim collective presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ceasefire and disarmament committees have been set up with<BR>representatives of the factions included, ECOMOG's field<BR>commander, Gen. John Mark Inienger told the head of the new<BR>transitional government, Professor Wilton Sankawulo when the<BR>latter called on him at the forces headquarters on Bushrod<BR>Island. Gen. Nienger praised the heads of the various<BR>factions for their commitment and preparedness to adhere to<BR>the terms of the Abuja accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a press release ECOMOG reiterated Gen. Inienger's<BR>earlier statement that ECOMOG was in Liberia to rescue the<BR>people from their predicament and tribulations, adding: &quot;We<BR>have been doing the job wholeheartedly because of the<BR>commitment we have to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof. Sankawulo, commended ECOMOG for the sacrifice it has<BR>made so far in Liberia in the quest for lasting peace. He<BR>also expressed optimism, that with the cooperation and<BR>protection of ECOMOG, the disarmament will commence as<BR>scheduled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also expressed renewed hope that with the presence of<BR>all key players in the civil conflict in the new government,<BR>he had no doubt that &quot;this is the beginning of the<BR>restoration of the peace that the people of Liberia have<BR>yearned for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a related development, the UNOMIL has had its mandate<BR>extended to January 31, 1996. UNOMIL's previous strength of<BR>300 personnel, presently reduced to 70, will be restored in a<BR>bid to assist ECOMOG with the disarmament exercise of some<BR>60,000 combatants in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A UNOMIL release said the UN is to shortly set up a<BR>pledging conference for Liberia to raise needed resources for<BR>ECOMOG and other needs critical to the advancement of the on<BR>going peace process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FREETOWN - Sierra Leone's President Valentine Strasser<BR>will send a high powered delegation to Monrovia, to confer<BR>with the Vice-Chairman of Liberia's six-man Council of State<BR>and head of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL),<BR>Charles Taylor, to assist in bringing an end to the on-going<BR>civil war in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A local daily in Monrovia on Tuesday, September 12,<BR>confirmed that Freetown has already informed its envoy who is<BR>the Doyen of the Diplomatic Corps in Liberia, Ambassador<BR>Wilfred Kanu, to send feelers to Taylor and to make<BR>arrangements for a meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although there has been no confirmation from Ambassador<BR>Kanu, the Editor in Chief of the Concord Times newspaper in<BR>Freetown, Tony Hermart, was quoted as saying that the<BR>delegation will arrive in Monrovia as soon as word from<BR>Ambassador Kanu was received.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sierra Leone's rebels of the Revolutionary United Front<BR>(RUF) have shunned all peace meetings with Strasser.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sankoh, began his rebellion in the extreme south-east of<BR>the country in March 1991, and according to official figures,<BR>his rebels, have caused the death of over 15,000 people and<BR>forced nearly 40 per cent of the country's 4.5 million people<BR>to flee their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The RUF is believed to have the full backing of NPFL, and<BR>rebels of either groups are said to have fought along side<BR>each other in return for full support when either party wins<BR>control of their respective neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sankoh originally wanted to overthrow former President<BR>General Joseph Momoh who now lives in exile in neighbouring<BR>Guinea. The present ruling military junta headed by Captain<BR>Valentine Strasser, 29, came to power in April 1992 and<BR>immediately promised to end the civil war by negotiations or<BR>outright victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile twenty six cases of HIV/AIDS virus have been<BR>reported in Monrovia since the beginning of the year through<BR>July, bringing to 69 the total number of AIDS cases in<BR>Liberia since 1986, the INFO-AIDS Bulletin, circulated by<BR>Liberia's National AIDS and STD Control Programme has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report comes in the wake of a study conducted earlier<BR>this year, in which it was established that a greater<BR>proportion of students in the Monrovia area were sexually<BR>active. An improved percentage of awareness of the disease in<BR>Liberia, one of the least affected countries in Africa, was<BR>also reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The percentage of sexually active youth under 17 in the<BR>city and its environs was put at 83.7 per cent. Chaos,<BR>frustration and redundancy caused by war have been blamed for<BR>the increase in sexual activity. The increased percentage of<BR>those that actually believe that AIDS exists in Liberia was<BR>placed at 78.6 per cent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>September 20, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GENEVA - Ahead of the official visit by Pope John Paul II<BR>to Africa, the World Council of Churches (WCC) has welcomed<BR>the Pontiff's recent encyclical letter on &quot;Commitment to<BR>Ecumenism&quot; (Ut Unum Sint) and highlighted its importance in<BR>the search for visible unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the 46th WCC Central Committee meeting here<BR>(September 14-22), Dr. Konrad Raiser, the WCC General<BR>Secretary, also accentuated his first official visit to the<BR>Vatican on April 6, 1995 which included intensive<BR>conversations with the Pontiff's Council for Promoting<BR>Christian Unity as well as encounters with &quot;secretariats&quot;<BR>whom the WCC desires to cooperate more with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Raiser told the 150-member Committee that in its<BR>active commitment to the search for visible unity the Vatican<BR>acknowledges the WCC. However, the WCC's &quot;comprehensive task<BR>to further the cooperation of the churches in their<BR>missionary and educational efforts, witness to justice, peace<BR>and reconciliation, and in furthering ecumenical renewal&quot;<BR>meets with only limited response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The basic &quot;asymmetry&quot; between the Roman Catholic Church<BR>and the World Council of Churches &quot;two Christian world bodies<BR>of very different nature, has to be acknowledged and<BR>respected,&quot; noted the General Secretary, as he outlined WCC's<BR>commitment to strengthening relationships with member<BR>churches and the wider ecumenical constituency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the flow of communication between member churches and<BR>the WCC, the General Secretary noted that &quot;often the WCC has<BR>been criticised for not communicating effectively with the<BR>member churches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However valid this claim may be, said Raiser, one must<BR>admit that communication is a two-way affair and without a<BR>sense of mutuality on the part of the member churches,<BR>efforts by the WCC to improve its performance will only have<BR>a limited effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Referring to the work of the Council's Office for Church<BR>and Ecumenical Relations, the General Secretary nevertheless<BR>commended new contacts that have been/are being developed<BR>with evangelical, pentecostal and &quot;independent&quot; churches in<BR>Christian communities especially in Latin America and Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another important aspect of strengthening relations<BR>between WCC and member churches is through personal visits.<BR>In this respect, Raiser particularly mentioned his personal<BR>visits to WCC member churches since he took office in January<BR>1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that he had travelled repeatedly to all the<BR>ecumenical regions, except the Pacific, and visited member<BR>churches, councils and regional organisations in altogether<BR>38 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alongside his own efforts, the WCC General Secretary<BR>appreciated the fact that more and more member churches are<BR>adopting the practice of regular visits by church leaders and<BR>ecumenical executives to Geneva for intensive encounters with<BR>the staff here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turning to programmes of the WCC, the General Secretary<BR>noted that efforts towards fuller integration of the units<BR>and inter-unit cooperation have continued and are bearing<BR>fruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Raiser also reported that the deterioration of the<BR>financial situation of the WCC had given rise to new<BR>questions and concerns, among them whether the Council's<BR>programmes and the structures designed to facilitate the<BR>mandate are sustainable in the long run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If budget reductions become inevitable, how do we arrive<BR>at the necessary decisions?&quot; posed the WCC General Secretary.<BR>The financial status of the WCC came particularly to light<BR>following the conclusion of a review initiated in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Raiser noted that while recommendations of the review<BR>process suggest only limited structural adjustments for the<BR>time being, &quot;further adjustments may be called for under the<BR>pressure of limited resources.&quot; He suggested that &quot;not all<BR>programmes need to be served by full- time staff persons<BR>based in Geneva.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing himself to the search for &quot;Common Understanding<BR>and Vision&quot;, Dr. Raiser pointed out that while the WCC is<BR>still the most comprehensive global ecumenical instrument,<BR>the ecumenical movement has in fact become a polycentric<BR>network and the WCC &quot;cannot and should not pretend to be its<BR>main centre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WCC General Secretary based his reflections on<BR>convictions that changes which are currently taking place on<BR>the global level in the life of the churches and in the<BR>ecumenical and religious situation challenge all partners in<BR>the ecumenical movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Raiser further observed that although many of the<BR>Christian World Communions have played a decisive role in the<BR>ecumenical movement over the last 25 years through the<BR>process of bilateral doctrinal dialogue, these are, however,<BR>not related originally with institutional framework of the<BR>WCC despite the large overlap of membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of shrinking resources, can the &quot;oneness&quot; or<BR>&quot;wholeness&quot; of the ecumenical movement still be preserved<BR>against the tendencies of fragmentation and competitiveness?<BR>Dr. Raiser asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appreciating the various understandings regarding the<BR>goals, methods and main actors of the ecumenical movement,<BR>Dr. Raiser underscored the oneness of the movement which he<BR>stressed was rooted in &quot;Jesus Christ as the only centre and<BR>nourished by living trust in the presence of the Holy<BR>Spirit.&quot; differences of understanding among the partners in a<BR>mutually committed dialogue aiming at clearer discernment and<BR>faithfulness to the common calling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The common understanding of the WCC should therefore not<BR>only reflect its task of nurturing and deepening the<BR>ecclesial relationships between its member churches, but also<BR>articulate its calling to safeguard and further &quot;the oneness&quot;<BR>or &quot;wholeness&quot; of the ecumenical movement, added Raiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Central Committee members responding to Dr. Raiser's<BR>report commended the General Secretary for highlighting<BR>issues that are of fundamental concern for the identity of<BR>the World Council of Churches as a &quot;council of Churches&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Dr. David J. Mandeng of the Presbyterian Church of<BR>Cameroon, commenting on the WCC future direction vis a vis<BR>its relationship with the member churches and other<BR>ecumenical organisations, and on the question of financial<BR>resources, noted: &quot;Some may think he is asking for too much<BR>but I would say he is not asking enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that after nearly 50 years, of talking about the<BR>ecumenical movement, it is obvious that a lot of things have<BR>changed and the WCC should acknowledge these changes. Rev.<BR>Mandeng was reacting to the challenges raised by Dr. Raiser<BR>regarding the future of WCC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Sri Winarti Soedjatmoko of East Java Christian<BR>Church, Indonesia, described Dr. Raiser's report as<BR>enlightening and noted that questions raised on the future<BR>direction of the ecumenical movement could not be ignored by<BR>churches in Asia which are currently faced with challenges<BR>from other religions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Council of Churches is a fellowship of churches,<BR>now 324, in more than 100 countries throughout the world<BR>representing all Christian traditions. The Roman Catholic<BR>Church is not a member of Council of Churches but works<BR>cooperatively with the WCC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council's highest governing body is the Assembly which<BR>meets approximately every seven years. Since its first<BR>assembly in Amsterdam in 1948, when it was formed, the<BR>Council's chief legislative body has met in Evanston, near<BR>Chicago (1954), New Delhi (1961), Uppsala (1968), Nairobi<BR>(1975), Vancouver (1983) and Canberra (1991). The eighth<BR>Assembly, which will feature prominently at the current<BR>Central Committee, is scheduled for Harare, Zimbabwe, in 1998<BR>when WCC will also celebrate its 50th anniversary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The basis of the WCC, with which member churches express<BR>agreement, is a fellowship of churches which confess to the<BR>Lord Jesus Christ as God and Saviour according to the<BR>Scriptures and therefore seek to fulfill together their<BR>common calling to the glory of the one God, Father, Son and<BR>Holy Spirit. The present WCC General Secretary, Dr. Konrad<BR>Raiser is from the Evangelical Church in Germany.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>September 20, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - Pope John Paul II has called on the<BR>international community to stop selling arms to African<BR>countries and has urged African governments to move away from<BR>huge expenditures on weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing 300,000 people who came to hear him on his<BR>first Mass on South African soil, in Johannesburg, on Sunday,<BR>September 17, Pope John Paul said that the international arms<BR>trade is affecting Africa and needs serious attention. &quot;I ask<BR>governments to put the emphasis on education, health and the<BR>well-being of their people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African media gave a generally enthusiastic<BR>welcome to the Pope's visit to the country following the long<BR>struggle to democracy that culminated in the first ever<BR>multi-racial elections, and subsequently government, in April<BR>1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an editorial, one of KwaZulu-Natal's leading papers,<BR>the Daily News, said that the pontiff's visit represented<BR>&quot;one of the final symbolic acts in welcoming South Africa<BR>back into the global community.&quot; The paper urged all South<BR>Africans &quot;regardless of their religions, to heed the Pope's<BR>plea and strive for lasting peace and prosperity.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At an ecumenical meeting at the Cathedral of Christ the<BR>King in Johannesburg, the Pope repeated his plea to the<BR>international community and to African governments. The<BR>pontiff also officially promulgated the proposals made at the<BR>close of last year's Africa Synod held in Rome. He said that<BR>the proposals represented a pastoral plan of action for the<BR>Church in Africa. &quot;At the synod, the bishops testified to the<BR>resilient faith and steadfast commitment of their<BR>communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added: &quot;Often their pastoral experience obliged them to<BR>speak of the particularly worrying situations in which most<BR>Africans live, the widespread deterioration in the standard<BR>of living, the insufficiency of means for educating the<BR>young, the elementary health and social services with the<BR>resulting persistence of endemic diseases, the spread of the<BR>terrible scourge of Aids, the often unbearable burden of<BR>international debt, the horror of fratricidal wars fomented<BR>by unscrupulous arms trafficking, and the shameful and<BR>pitiable spectacle of refugees and displaced persons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pope said the Synod's moral judgment on this situation<BR>was both compassionate and severe. The dehumanisation and<BR>oppression affecting people presented the ecclesiastical<BR>community with both a crisis and a challenge, he asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is true,&quot; said the Pontiff, &quot;that Africa has a long,<BR>sad history of exploitation at the hands of others,&quot; adding<BR>that: &quot;Today the situation continues in new forms -- unjust<BR>trading conditions, the dumping of harmful wastes, and the<BR>overly demanding conditions imposed by Structural Adjustment<BR>Programmes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pope observed that not only the Church, but many<BR>international bodies including the United Nations Summit for<BR>Social Development held in Copenhagen this year, have called<BR>for aid programmes and economic policies to promote real<BR>social progress and development through efforts to eradicate<BR>poverty, stimulate employment and help all sectors of society<BR>to take a more active part in the public debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that when the Synod called on the Church to become<BR>more actively involved in the struggle for the defence of<BR>personal dignity, for justice and social peace, the African<BR>bishops were giving voice to the unbreakable link between<BR>evangelisation and human advancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Kenya where he arrived on Monday, September 18, the<BR>Pontiff made an impassioned plea to religious and political<BR>leaders to reverse Africa's reputation as a haven of civil<BR>wars, hunger and poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said he: &quot;Africa is at a crossroads. It's people and their<BR>leaders are being called upon to exercise all the wisdom in<BR>the difficult and urgent task of promoting development which<BR>is not just economic and material but involves building a<BR>civilisation of respect for all of society's members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the country's Jomo Kenyatta International<BR>Airport upon his arrival, the Pope stressed &quot;I come as one<BR>who is deeply concerned for the destiny of Africa's peoples.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Church and states (Governments) had a duty to improve<BR>the welfare of Africans,&quot; he said, adding that: &quot;The Church<BR>was working for a civilisation founded on African traditions<BR>emphasising the rights of people over material things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that such civilisation should be founded on<BR>understanding, harmony, accommodation not divisive<BR>tendencies, social unity and solidarity. But such<BR>civilisation, he said, was more difficult to achieve when<BR>ethnic, social or political divisions were allowed to<BR>overshadow unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pope John Paul II stressed, however, that Africans were<BR>yearning for a civilisation that encompasses their rights and<BR>freedoms as well as the spiritual nature of every person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pope was in Africa on a six day tour that began in<BR>Cameroon on Thursday September 14. The trip, the 11th to the<BR>continent, was arguably the Pope's most important visit to<BR>Africa where some 95 million Catholics live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The purpose of the trip that took the Pontiff to Cameroon,<BR>South Africa and Kenya was to &quot;celebrate and announce&quot; the<BR>results of the controversial African Synod that was held in<BR>Rome last year. The Pope's &quot;exhortations&quot; or results of the<BR>Synod, will chart the course that the Catholic Church will<BR>follow into the 21st Century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While in Cameroon, the Pope publicly issued for the first<BR>time a document, The Church in Africa, which set out the<BR>results of the 1994 African Synod, itself the culmination of<BR>18 years of debate and preparation. He said the Synod<BR>&quot;rightly considered that an authentic democracy which<BR>respects pluralism is one of the principal routes along which<BR>the Church travels with the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He assured African nations that the Roman Catholic Church<BR>would not give up urging international solidarity for the<BR>underprivileged continent. But the Pope also denounced &quot;many<BR>African nations&quot; for authoritarian and repressive rule which<BR>denied citizens personal freedom and fundamental human<BR>rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He declared bluntly that &quot;Africa's economic problems are<BR>compounded by the dishonesty of corrupt government leaders<BR>who...divert national resources for their own profit and<BR>transfer public funds to private accounts in foreign banks.&quot;<BR>This, he said, was &quot;plain theft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The high point of the Pope's visit in all the three<BR>countries were the open air Masses which in Nairobi, Kenya<BR>was attended by an estimated crowd of between 500,000celebrated with Cardinals and Bishops from the Western,<BR>1,000,000 people. The climax of the Masses, the Pontiff corespectively, was the issuing and handing over to African<BR>Southern, and Eastern and Central African sub-regions<BR>clergy the results of the African Synod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his sermon during the Mass in Nairobi, the Pope made a<BR>vibrant defence of the family. The Pontiff later switched<BR>from English to French to refer to the small central African<BR>nations of Rwanda and Burundi, where he warned that terrible<BR>ethnic conflict is still latent after having engulfed so many<BR>innocent victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He urged forgiveness and reconciliation between the two<BR>countries' Hutus and Tutsis. &quot;This is the only way to<BR>dissipate the threat of ethnocentrism which looms over<BR>Africa,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Throughout the trip, Pope John Paul emphasised that: &quot;As<BR>the universal pastor for the Catholic Church, I wish to come<BR>to Africa at this time in order to urge my brothers and<BR>sisters in the faith to stand steadfast in the gospel of<BR>Jesus Christ and to assume with unfailing generosity the<BR>challenge which the Synod proposes -- a new evangelisation<BR>with the fresh spirit of service to the people of this<BR>continent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An interesting aspect of the Pope's 11th trip to Africa,<BR>is that he traveled on national carriers in apparent<BR>solidarity with the continent. Having arrived in Yaounde,<BR>Cameroon on 14th September, on Alitalia from Italy, the Pope<BR>flew to South Africa on Cameroon Airlines. From South Africa<BR>he flew aboard South African Airways to Nairobi, from where<BR>he traveled on Kenya Airways back to Rome on Wednesday,<BR>September 20th at 11;00 a.m.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>September 15, 1995<BR>by Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - THERE'S a new way of describing women who<BR>challenge male domination at Safety and Security headquarters<BR>in Pretoria: the women are told they are &quot;doing a Zelda&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zelda being referred to is Zelda Holtzman, a<BR>thirtysomething from Cape Town who in June became the<BR>highest-ranking black woman in South African police history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was appointed to the South African Police Service<BR>Change Management Team (CMT) at a rank equivalent to<BR>brigadier, but since change in the force now includes the<BR>demilitarisation of ranks, her post is rated as director.<BR>&quot;But I insist that I'm just Zelda and get everybody, from<BR>generals to constables, to address me by my first name,&quot; she<BR>said this week. &quot;The police culture in the past held dearly<BR>to rank and authority and by getting them to use my first<BR>name, I am trying to change those attitudes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holtzman believes her prickly task of transforming the<BR>SAPS will be made easier with her belief in leading by<BR>example. So she is particularly careful to ensure her<BR>performance not only inspires other women and blacks to reach<BR>for senior positions in the force, but also encourages<BR>democratic procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She shrugs off criticism that she is under-skilled and<BR>under-trained for her position. Her appointment was met with<BR>some protests from senior police personnel who had undergone<BR>police training and risen through the ranks but had not<BR>succeeded in their applications for her position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holtzman's only previous experience in policing was a<BR>stint with the Community Peace Foundation, an NGO engaged in<BR>community work in the field of popular justice and which did<BR>some training of police officers in community policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a member of a network of police officers, she was drawn<BR>into the Minister of Safety and Security's advisory team last<BR>year before she applied for her present post. &quot;I was very<BR>two-minded about applying for the job; at 3pm on the day<BR>applications closed, my CV was still not ready,&quot; Holtzman<BR>said. &quot;What inspired me was the fact that women across colour<BR>lines, even those competing against me for the job, rallied<BR>around me and convinced me that strong women were needed in<BR>the department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I haven't had much difficulty in getting people to accept<BR>my authority, because I believe so strongly in leading by<BR>example. I have found that black police personnel who have<BR>been subjected to the ideology of domination for so long have<BR>been cheering me the loudest. Now people across colour lines<BR>are beginning to identify with my vision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holtzman's cause is a difficult one. The CMT comprises 40<BR>technical teams facing the challenge of amalgamating 11<BR>police agencies into one professional, community-oriented<BR>agency which provides quality service.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - The Attorney General of KwaZulu-Natal, Tim<BR>McNally, is suing the Mail &amp; Guardian for R250 000 over<BR>reports published last month detailing criticism of his<BR>handling of investigations into hit squad activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McNally, charging that the reports &quot;cut at the very heart<BR>of his reputation and dignity&quot;, has demanded publication of a<BR>&quot;complete, unconditional and unequivocal retraction and<BR>apology&quot; in this edition of the newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The M&amp;G has instructed its lawyers to oppose the action,<BR>raising as part of its defence the United States Supreme<BR>Court judgment in the case of the New York Times v Sullivan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judgment, delivered in 1964, established that a public<BR>official cannot sue for libel in regard to the exercise of<BR>his official duties unless it can be proven that allegations<BR>were published without an honest belief that they were true,<BR>or with reckless disregard as to whether they were true or<BR>not.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The argument underlying the case was that the threat of<BR>libel action deters free speech and dampens public debate on<BR>policy issues. The principle has been adopted in varying<BR>degrees by, among others, the European Court of Human Rights,<BR>the Indian Supreme Court, the Australian High Court and the<BR>Law Lords in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1988 the US Supreme Court reaffirmed the decision in<BR>the New York Times v. Sullivan with another landmark<BR>judgement which overturned an award of damages against the<BR>pornographer, Larry C. Flynt, for publishing a parody<BR>depicting the Rev. Jerry Falwell having sex with his mother<BR>in an outhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chief Justice, William H. Rehnquist, in a unanimous<BR>judgment by the eight- member court, said: &quot;The freedom to<BR>speak one's mind is not only an aspect of individual liberty<BR>- and thus a good unto itself - but also is essential to the<BR>common quest for truth and the vitality of society as a<BR>whole.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - The troubled Limpopo River area is in<BR>trouble again -- this time from the effects of herbicides<BR>used by contractors employed by the SADF, writes Stephanie<BR>Dippenaar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ILLEGAL and dangerous herbicides -- used by South African<BR>Defence Force contractors to control 70km of sisal fence<BR>along the Zimbabwe border -- have contaminated farmers' crops<BR>and natural vegetation along the Limpopo River, a Northern<BR>Province inquiry heard this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Agricultural Research Board told a commission of<BR>inquiry, appointed by provincial MEC of Agriculture Dr Tienie<BR>Burgers, that it had found traces of unregistered herbicides<BR>in and around the sisal fence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Their research has clearly shown that two products,<BR>Brumisal and Ethidimuron, are present not only in the sisal<BR>fence, but also in the seepage areas, the river bed and the<BR>agricultural crop areas,&quot; said the commission's Dr Gerhard<BR>Verdoorn. He also confirmed that the two herbicides were not<BR>registered as required by law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fence was erected in the early 1980s to keep<BR>&quot;undesirable elements&quot; from neighbouring countries from<BR>entering South Africa. Ironically, the area's farmers whom<BR>the &quot;impenetrable&quot; sisal fence was supposed to protect, have<BR>for years claimed that they suffered great crop losses<BR>because of the use of herbicides on the fence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fence was the responsibility of the former SADF and<BR>they employed contractors to maintain it from 1982 to around<BR>the end of 1992. For the first three years herbicides with<BR>the active ingredients of Ethidimuron and Brumisal were used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the evidence is a letter dated July 6 1984, in which<BR>the manufacturer strongly advised the contractor against<BR>using these herbicides. The manager of the chemical section<BR>of the manufacturer warned in the letter that the continued<BR>use of the herbicide could be dangerous, &quot;even to the sisal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prescriptions on the label of the particular herbicide<BR>also specifically warn that it should not be used in the<BR>vicinity of water, agricultural crops and rivers --<BR>instructions which were clearly contravened. A list of plant<BR>species is mentioned which should not come into contact with<BR>the herbicide. Various of these are indigenous species in the<BR>area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From about 1986 a herbicide with the active ingredient<BR>Thebuthiron was allegedly used by the contractors. This<BR>herbicide is registered for use on the sisal, but it appears<BR>this, like the herbicides used earlier, was sprayed at a much<BR>greater frequency than the manufacturer recommended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ecologist Professor Ben van der Waal said: &quot;If you use the<BR>substances every year at full strength, as it is alleged<BR>happened, for 10 consecutive years, then you'll get an<BR>accumulation of the poison,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Irrigation farmers next to the fence have claimed that<BR>their crops declined dramatically since the application of<BR>the herbicides started in 1982. They complained that yield<BR>dropped up to 90 tons a hectare in the worst years. However,<BR>for many years these complaints were put down to the result<BR>of the bad drought in the area, increased salinity and even<BR>general bad farming practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is not only the border farmers who are concerned<BR>about the use of the herbicides. Ecologists are up in arms<BR>about the presence of herbicide poison in the sisal fence<BR>where it runs through the Matshakatini Nature Reserve, which<BR>has become all the more important in the context of talks<BR>about the establishment of a trans-national game reserve. The<BR>Matshakatini reserve would form an important link between the<BR>Kruger National Park and the parks of Mozambique, Zimbabwe<BR>and Botswana in the east and north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Visiting the Limpopo area one can clearly see that the<BR>vegetation on the southern side of the river is in a poorer<BR>condition than on the northern side. This is not the case<BR>further east where the sisal fence is further removed from<BR>the river. But the Department of Agriculture claims infrared<BR>photos taken of the area show no difference -- and say that<BR>even if there is a difference, it is not necessarily linked<BR>to the herbicides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Van der Waal said the fence in itself had already damaged<BR>the environment in that it disturbed animal migration<BR>patterns. He said if the fence was removed it could leave a<BR>scar of more than 70km in the nature reserve which could take<BR>a long time to recover fully because of the presence of the<BR>poisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It can take anything from 50 to a 100 years to recover. A<BR>long stretch in the middle of a national, possibly<BR>international, park where trees are still dying is totally<BR>unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - The consortium of management consultants<BR>hired by Parliament to investigate restructuring, at a cost<BR>of almost half a million rand, is racked by internal<BR>tensions, accusations against one partner of previous<BR>failures to deliver and the defection of a respected team<BR>member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African firm of Kenneth Mgqamqo &amp; Associates<BR>joined forces with the international giant Deloitte and<BR>Touche to win the tender put out by the presiding officers<BR>(Speaker of the National Assembly Frene Ginwala and President<BR>of the Senate Kobie Coetsee) at a price of R430 000 plus<BR>direct disbursements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the lead-up to the presentation of an interim report<BR>last week, &quot;significant differences of approach&quot; emerged<BR>between the partners. A source close to Kenneth Mgqamqo and<BR>Associates revealed that it was unhappy with the rigidity of<BR>Deloitte and Touche's approach.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They are trying to impose their set methodology on the<BR>problem as if Parliament was just another corporate job. But<BR>it is not. It is unique and needs a more flexible approach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An informant close to the Speaker's office told the Whip<BR>that Ginwala was &quot;not entirely happy with the way things were<BR>going&quot; and conceded that the process &quot;was a bit of a mess.<BR>They are trying to apply rigid systems on a flexible<BR>situation. Parliament is not a business -- it is more like a<BR>university&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is in this context that a number of senior<BR>parliamentary staff members expressed concern at the news<BR>that self-employed management consultant Tony Harper, the<BR>third element of the consortium, had left the project team.<BR>According to sources close to the Speaker's office, Harper<BR>resigned because &quot;he felt his principles were being<BR>compromised&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The source said that Harper was &quot;prepared to be flexible,<BR>he had built up good personal relations and had won the trust<BR>of most people. Moreover, he is committed to genuinely<BR>transforming Parliament&quot;. Harper himself would make no<BR>comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another informant described relations between Kenneth<BR>Mgqamqo and Associates and Deloitte and Touche as reflecting<BR>the &quot;cultural geography of the parliamentary system&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The South African representatives of Deloitte and Touche<BR>are white, male Afrikaners. The people of colour on the team<BR>are all from Kenneth Mgqamqo. Thus, tensions on the ground<BR>are reflected in the consulting team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Questions are being raised over Mgqamqo's capacity to<BR>deliver. In 1994, he was employed by the Western Cape<BR>Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) as a district<BR>electoral officer, but was dismissed on the eve of the<BR>historic April election after a bitter dispute between him<BR>and Western Cape IEC deputy director Kuleleka Lubelwana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mgqamqo was responsible for a team of 10 people with<BR>jurisdiction over the critical Mitchell's Plain area of Cape<BR>Town, which included Khayelitsha township. Lubelwana, who is<BR>now employed as Director of SCATT (the Social Change<BR>Assistance Trust), told the Whip Mgqamqo was dismissed at the<BR>end of Tuesday April 26 1994 -- the special voting day for<BR>the elderly, infirm and disabled -- because of his alleged<BR>failure to deliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later in 1994, Mgqamqo was contracted by Lingelethi City<BR>Council -- which also covers Khayelitsha -- to do some<BR>organisational restructuring at a contract price of R300 000.<BR>Again, there was a failure to deliver. A senior source at<BR>Lingelethi City Council said they were &quot;dissatisfied with the<BR>product. They seemed like they could do the work, but the<BR>problems they were hired to solve are still there&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>September 15, 1995<BR>by Paul Wilkes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - JOHN PAUL II, who survived an assassination<BR>attempt 13 years ago, the removal of a tumour the size of an<BR>orange two years ago and who suffered two bad falls within a<BR>year, still has his faith intact. But no longer can his iron<BR>will command a weakening body to do its bidding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To talk of John Paul's last days is to begin to consider<BR>the next pontiff -- who, one day, will succeed the most<BR>travelled and most widely known pope in history. When the<BR>next conclave is called and the cardinals are summoned to<BR>Vatican City, there to meet each day in the Sistine Chapel<BR>until a decision is reached, who will have their vote? One<BR>who will continue the legacy of John Paul? Or will they turn<BR>away from his often sternly didactic view of humankind's<BR>halting efforts and enlist a less rigid pastor to guide them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will not be an easy choice. Never, in recent history,<BR>has the Catholic Church been so strong and so divided. Among<BR>the papabili, the cardinals who will choose the 265th pope,<BR>as among Catholics throughout the world, there are<BR>essentially two passions at work.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One is still confident of its power under an enormously<BR>popular pope, who has transformed the Vatican into a<BR>doctrinal clearing house, rewarding the faithful while meting<BR>out punishment to the wayward. The other sees a pope who has<BR>listened to the roar of the crowds but not to the cries and<BR>whispers of individuals who do not share his vision. It is<BR>these two visions that will one day clash in the Sistine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the year 607, the Church issued a proclamation<BR>forbidding papal electors, under pain of excommunication, any<BR>discussion of a successor during a reigning pope's lifetime.<BR>But such an edict never did, and never will, stop like-minded<BR>cardinals from seeing one another to talk about the current<BR>state of the church and, by clerical osmosis, to form the<BR>alliances they will take into the conclave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Paul seems hardly troubled by such manoeuvring. A<BR>pronouncement last year -- banning divorced Catholics, who<BR>have remarried without obtaining an annulment, from receiving<BR>holy communion -- proves the Vatican's moral sonar is still<BR>functioning. And the wide-ranging proclamation that looked<BR>ahead to the third millennium illustrated the pope's steely<BR>determination that he and his invincible reign will go on for<BR>years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He's amazing. The strength ...&quot; says Pio Cardinal Laghi,<BR>prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education, one of<BR>the offices of the Roman Curia, the body that helps the pope<BR>govern the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This congregation has performed masterfully for John Paul,<BR>conducting periodic &quot;apostolic visitations&quot; to seminaries<BR>worldwide to assure purity of doctrine and depth of<BR>allegiance. They have set limits on theological dissent that<BR>some church members have found chillingly repressive. Many<BR>Catholics working in the Vatican and in the church's<BR>administrative diaspora throughout Rome feel that the Second<BR>Vatican Council produced an atmosphere more sympathetic to<BR>the difficulties of living out an imitation of Christ in the<BR>modern world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under John Paul, they say, they have seen dedicated people<BR>demoralised, careers ruined and lives shattered. While loyal<BR>to their pope, they are extraordinarily resentful. A<BR>generation of moral moles seems to be in every office,<BR>classroom and espresso bar in Rome, listening for lapses from<BR>the one, true faith. John Paul will leave a powerful<BR>religious empire, but one riddled with distrust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Is this a way to run a Church, to live a moral life, when<BR>you have to be careful of everything you say, every friend<BR>you have, everyone you are seen with?&quot; one senior member of<BR>his religious order asked. &quot;We should be in this together;<BR>instead we look at each other as the enemy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A long-term curia priest noted that under Pope Paul VI he<BR>actually had fun on the job. Now, he said: &quot;It's an attitude<BR>of servile obsequiousness. Daily, I feel nibbled to death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interpretations of how John Paul came to forge his<BR>distinct and controversial papacy abound in Rome. One of the<BR>most compelling is from a priest who is in the top<BR>administration of his monastic order and has worked closely<BR>with the pope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Know the man and his background and these 16 years are<BR>perfectly in line,&quot; he began. &quot;In Poland, you were for<BR>communism or against it. In Poland, to turn out a crowd was<BR>to show you had power. So, there you are: his theology --<BR>black and white, absolute -- and his fixation with the<BR>crowds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I would add one other quality of his make-up -- his<BR>penchant for suffering. Poland in the 19th and 20th centuries<BR>suffered as no country suffered. He sees his life as a<BR>continuation of that suffering. He does not avoid it; he<BR>takes it on. Heroic? Yes. But is this what the church needs,<BR>all this suffering? John Paul is a man of his time, but the<BR>next pope must be a man of our time. The Cold War is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The next conclave will be entirely different to the one<BR>that elected John Paul in 1978. Of the 166 cardinals, 120 are<BR>now under the age of 80 and therefore eligible to vote. The<BR>number of Italian electors has declined, while the number of<BR>Eastern Europeans, Asians, Africans, South Americans and<BR>North Americans has increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nowhere in the world is Catholicism flourishing as it is<BR>in Africa, where tens of thousands have been converted during<BR>John Paul's reign. The surge of religious vocations often<BR>outstrips the capacity to house and train those who seek to<BR>be priests, brothers and nuns. After Eastern Europe's quick<BR>transformation from legions of righteous freedom fighters to<BR>packs of pleasure-seeking hedonists, it is to Africa and the<BR>rest of the Third World that the pope increasingly looks for<BR>the future growth of Catholicism and an antidote to the<BR>Western world's moral degradation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So it is that the name of an otherwise obscure 62-year-old<BR>Nigerian, Francis Cardinal Arinze, has been frequently<BR>mentioned as a possible successor. After warning that he did<BR>not want to touch on anything &quot;political&quot; -- his euphemism<BR>for talk of papal succession -- Cardinal Arinze talked of the<BR>reasons for Catholicism's stunning evangelisation in post&quot;Much of African belief is animism, and animism is very,<BR>colonial Africa.<BR>very close to Catholicism, so there is natural attraction, an<BR>affinity,&quot; he told me. &quot;In animism, there is one God, spirits<BR>good and evil, worship of ancestors, rituals. I was born an<BR>animist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But we must be very careful indeed in this work. My job<BR>is to make sure that other religious groups know our plans,<BR>our techniques for evangelisation&quot; -- he was referring<BR>obliquely here to Islam, with which Catholicism is competing<BR>in Africa -- &quot;and that we are aware of theirs so that we --<BR>how do you say? -- are not stepping on their toes. Yes, we<BR>feel the Catholic message is for the whole world, but we must<BR>propose, not impose. The church in each land must be seen as<BR>a tree growing out of its own soil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cardinal Arinze looked out the window as if for guidance<BR>and added: &quot;We have been fortunate to have a holy father who<BR>has helped the world to have a clear picture of what<BR>Catholicism is. People may not do what he says, but at least<BR>they have heard the word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We do not need uniformity, but unity.&quot; Cardinal Arinze is<BR>given to outbursts of head-thrown-back laughter. These came<BR>forth with his next thought: &quot;And the pope is not a man to<BR>make a discount, so that people will buy!&quot;<BR>South Africa<BR> Frene takes flack for the crisis<BR>(tx<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>September 15, 1995<BR>by Christelle Terreblanche and Richard Calland</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE African National Congress last week rejected reports<BR>that Parliament was in crisis while, off the record, MPs and<BR>chairpersons of committees continued to relate frustrations<BR>over hiccups they have experienced this session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most intense frustrations of committee chairs are<BR>directed towards the Speaker, Frene Ginwala, but they also<BR>point fingers at whips and the executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC has acknowledged that the process of getting<BR>legislation to Parliament has been too slow, but there is<BR>disagreement on the causes. Said one committee chairperson:<BR>&quot;The vision of the ANC was to create an institution that is<BR>transparent, responsive and efficient. That implies a welland, more importantly, push through the transformation<BR>functioning committee system that can oversee the departments<BR>processes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet some committee chairs are so upset about what they<BR>call the &quot;bypassing of consultation&quot; that they have alerted<BR>other ANC structures like the National Working Committee and<BR>National Executive Committee (NEC) about their concerns. They<BR>say the ruling party will have to make certain political<BR>decisions and step in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a range of interviews, everyone was eager to pass the<BR>buck. MPs accuse whips, whips blame the executive, the<BR>executive raises questions about the legislature and chairs<BR>of committees point fingers at the Speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chairpersons say important decisions and allocation of<BR>funds have, in some cases, been delayed for almost a year.<BR>They said that instead of making them part of her team,<BR>Ginwala &quot;made enemies out of us&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some chairpersons feel that the two to three million rand<BR>allocated for the committees is far too little. They say most<BR>of them have no secretarial, research or other support, and<BR>that 16 portfolio committees share only 10 committee clerks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those committees which have non-government organisation<BR>support staff are unable to renew their contracts because a<BR>new rule stipulates that the Speaker must first approve this.<BR>They also allege that funds are not released for them to<BR>travel to poverty-stricken, distant areas and that,<BR>consequently, it is often only lobby groups representing<BR>affluent sections of the community that are heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of MPs, mostly from minority parties, jump to the<BR>Speaker's defence. They welcome her commitment to affirmative<BR>action towards women and her determination to give minority<BR>parties a voice. MPs also applaud Ginwala's efforts to make<BR>Parliament a more people-friendly and accessible environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fiercest criticism against her, however, is that many<BR>of the current problems were pointed out to her months ago<BR>and her response to proposals and criticism has been<BR>&quot;negative&quot; and &quot;autocratic&quot;. A few went so far as to say that<BR>the Speaker is assuming more power than is appropriate for<BR>the position and that she seems to be threatened by the<BR>committees' expanding power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whips were astounded by criticisms levelled against them.<BR>They generally feel that the problem lies with departments<BR>and that Cabinet should take ultimate responsibility for<BR>getting the legislation through in time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team of management consultants hired by Parliament to<BR>help it solve its organisational and management problems are<BR>wrestling with a range of issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the heart of the matter is the question of whether the<BR>present secretariat of Parliament should have a management<BR>function and, if so, the extent of that function. Some<BR>members of the consultancy team are arguing strongly for a<BR>new tier of management to be added to the current hierarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One source from within the team said that &quot;there is an<BR>amazing lack of understanding about what democratic<BR>management means. The fact of the matter is that the<BR>parliamentary secretariat has never had to manage before in<BR>the sense of making real decisions. In the old days, they<BR>simply did what they were told. Robin Douglas (as secretary<BR>to Parliament, its most senior employee) is trying very hard,<BR>but he is floundering&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Douglas himself accepts that he and his colleagues in the<BR>secretariat have no experience or expertise in management.<BR>&quot;The problem with a more proactive management style,&quot; says<BR>one of the most senior members of the secretariat, &quot;is that<BR>it takes us into the realm of political decision-making. We<BR>are in an impossible position: if we are passive we are<BR>blamed for being obstructionist; if we take decisions or make<BR>recommendations, one or other party blames us either for<BR>being 'old guard' or for being sycophantic to the majority<BR>party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The leaders of the house, Trade and Industry Minister<BR>Trevor Manuel and Environment Minister Dawie de Villiers,<BR>will play a more hands-on role from now on to co-ordinate the<BR>management of Parliament. Manuel acknowledged that the<BR>departments' limited capacities are partly to blame for the<BR>bottleneck in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Bill writing is therefore taking longer than usual. And<BR>some uncertainty remains while the constitutional process is<BR>not concluded. Original powers of provinces are not well<BR>defined yet. So we are hesitant to have legislation certified<BR>when there is a chance of it getting stuck in the<BR>Constitutional Court. There are complex checks and balances<BR>at play.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>September 15, 1995<BR>by Marion Edmunds and Ann Eveleth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - The recently released hardline Inkatha<BR>Freedom Party constitution calls for a provincial army,<BR>exclusive provincial policing powers and the right to refuse<BR>intervention in the province by the South African National<BR>Defence Force. It also claims exclusive powers over all<BR>constitutional, legislative, judicial, and financial matters<BR>and paves the way for an unelected provincial government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP draft says neither the provincial premier nor<BR>other members of the provincial cabinet need come from the<BR>elected parliament. The Zulu King is mandated, in<BR>consultation with the leaders of majority parties, to choose<BR>the premier, who is then empowered to form a cabinet at his<BR>discretion. The provincial parliament is then mandated to<BR>cast a vote of confidence or no confidence in the cabinet<BR>within 10 days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African National Congress analysis argues this feature<BR>&quot;produces an autocratic monarchist government which is not<BR>really responsible to the parliament and to the people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC has slammed the IFP constitution in an internal<BR>paper -- prepared for the party leadership but leaked to the<BR>Mail &amp; Guardian this week -- which claims that the IFP<BR>proposal &quot;is a document of secession ... written under the<BR>supposition of and in preparation for secession&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC said of the IFP security provisions for a<BR>Volunteer Reserve Force and exclusive provincial policing<BR>powers: &quot;There is no federation in the whole world which<BR>allows its inherent state to maintain its own army.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The release of the IFP constitution comes amid a growing<BR>rift between IFP provincial &quot;moderates&quot; and national<BR>hardliners over the multi-party constitutional negotiations<BR>in progress in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Provincial negotiators this week defied moves by national<BR>negotiator and IFP deputy national chairman Sipo Mzimela, and<BR>constitutional advisor Mario Ambrosini, to quash the multihardline principles which would surely have set the province<BR>party process and force a parliamentary vote on a set of<BR>on course for fresh elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mzimela last week rejected a compromise document drafted<BR>by all parties, but provincial negotiators this week pushed<BR>ahead with multi-party talks in the constitutional committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But provincial negotiators claimed last week that<BR>Mizimela's hardline position had &quot;nothing to do&quot; with their<BR>efforts to secure a negotiated compromise with other parties<BR>including the ANC in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers argue that the seismic rift in the IFP casts<BR>doubts on attempts to democratise party structures over the<BR>past year, while the heavy-handed interference of national<BR>leaders in the provincial process casts aspersions on the<BR>party's claims of federalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, a party whose claims to internal democracy are<BR>in dispute, is promoting a constitution that provides for the<BR>government of the &quot;kingdom&quot; to intervene in the internal<BR>affairs of political parties and trade unions whose<BR>structures are deemed undemocratic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The constitution also says: &quot;The kingdom of KwaZulu-Natal<BR>is a sovereign member state of the Republic of South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's rejoinder is that &quot;the notion of a 'member<BR>state' is only used within an international context: &quot;For<BR>example, the European states forming the European Union are<BR>called 'member states' in the Treaty of the European<BR>Community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC also criticises the IFP claim for &quot;a priority of<BR>the provincial constitution over the (national)<BR>constitution&quot;, saying &quot;the only similar rules are to be found<BR>in the separatist constitution of Tartarstan&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC argues these clauses &quot;could only be accepted after<BR>a secession of KwaZulu-Natal ... No federal state (anywhere<BR>in the world) can -- except in danger of its own dissolution<BR>-- permit that the legitimacy of its national actions would<BR>finally be controlled by the constitutions of its provinces<BR>or revised by their constitutional courts. The intention<BR>clearly is in the direction of secession&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP constitution also makes several declarations<BR>regarding the superiority of provincial laws over national<BR>laws. The ANC argues this claim for the &quot;sovereignty of<BR>parliament implies that the Republic of South Africa ...<BR>should only be a composed entity (not a state) consisting of<BR>sovereign provinces with all the attributes of a national<BR>state&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC compares this model to that of the European Union,<BR>&quot;which is also not yet a state, but merely a confederation of<BR>states&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>September 15, 1995<BR>by Paul Stober, Marion Edmonds, Eddie Koch and Ann Eveleth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - Evidence has emerged that the Inkatha<BR>Freedom Party (IFP), led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, plans to<BR>rebuild its paramilitary and intelligence capabilities --<BR>using German funds earmarked for development -- ahead of a<BR>possible showdown with central government over a constitution<BR>for Kwazulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, in the week that Chancellor Helmut Kohl made a state<BR>visit to South Africa, the Mail &amp; Guardian has learned that<BR>there is serious concern in President Nelson Mandela's office<BR>about the use of German funds in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources in Mandela's office say the president has an<BR>&quot;ongoing concern&quot; about German development funds to the IFP<BR>being diverted for intelligence and other paramilitary<BR>purposes in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is known that there is serious concern in the<BR>Cabinet's inner circle that the IFP may be trying to rebuild<BR>its policing and military capabilities ahead of a possible<BR>showdown with the central government over a federal<BR>constitution for KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite assurances from the German chancellor that his<BR>government does not interfere in South Africa's domestic<BR>affairs, it has emerged that the Konrad Adenauer Foundation,<BR>the taxpayer-financed funding agency of Kohl's Christian<BR>Democratic Union (CDU), has sunk tens of millions of rand<BR>into Inkatha over the last decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least two intelligence sources have told the M&amp;G this<BR>week that two German citizens currently in South Africa are<BR>involved in trying to devise ways of using money intended for<BR>development projects in Kwazulu-Natal to bankroll a new<BR>Inkatha intelligence unit. The intelligence unit is intended<BR>to replace the once- powerful Bureau of Security and<BR>Intelligence (BSI) which was disbanded together with the<BR>KwaZulu police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood that Joe Mathews, Deputy Minister of<BR>Safety and Security and a high-ranking Inkatha official, and<BR>IFP Senator Phillip Powell, will play leading roles in the<BR>new intelligence unit and that IFP leader Mangosuthu<BR>Buthelezi has been briefed about the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also named as a player is a man called Stan Armstrong, who<BR>is said to have played a key role in the BSI before the<BR>KwaZulu homeland was disbanded. Armstrong served as an<BR>administrative chief in IFP leader Buthelezi's office at the<BR>time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armstrong was named last year by Rian van Rensburg -- a<BR>former military officer who claims to have been involved in<BR>the training of paramilitary units for the IFP -- as the link<BR>man between his clandestine work and the party's leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are fears in the president's office that the<BR>proposed new intelligence agency is part of a more extensive<BR>set of contacts between the Inkatha Freedom Party and<BR>conservative organisations in Germany -- a major source of<BR>support for the IFP, especially since access to state revenue<BR>was cut off with the disbandment of the KwaZulu homeland.<BR>Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana refused to comment on<BR>the reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Large sums of money have been donated to Inkatha since<BR>1983 through the CDU's Konrad Adenauer Foundation. The<BR>Foundation receives German taxpayers' money to fund political<BR>and development programmes in the Third World. It is not<BR>allowed to finance political parties as such and the money<BR>has been paid to the Inkatha Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It emerged from the Inkathagate scandal that the Institute<BR>was the channel used by the South African security police for<BR>secret government funding of the IFP. Major Louis Botha, the<BR>security police officer who acted as the link man with<BR>Inkatha, has close family ties with Germany. Botha was<BR>arrested some three months ago and charged in connection with<BR>the murder of 13 ANC supporters in 1987. This month, Botha<BR>asked for his bail conditions to be lifted so that he could<BR>attend the &quot;50th wedding anniversary of his father-in-law&quot; in<BR>Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Inkatha Institute closed down after the Inkathagate<BR>scandal and has been replaced by the Institute for Federal<BR>Democracy. The Konrad Adenauer Foundation now donates some<BR>R3,5-million a year to the new institute. Sources close to<BR>the Adenauer Foundation say it is currently channelling a<BR>minimum of R9-million a year into political and development<BR>projects in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The head of the new-look institute is Rama Naidu, former<BR>head of the Konrad Adenauer office in Cape Town. Naidu<BR>insists his organisation is not a think-tank for Inkatha and<BR>that it offers its services to a wide range of political<BR>organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ingor Scholz, director of Konrad Adenauer's Africa desk,<BR>said he had been disappointed by past media reports linking<BR>foundation money to &quot;fomenting bloodshed in KwaZulu-Natal&quot;.<BR>Scholz stressed that the foundation was now providing<BR>constitutional support to all political parties in South<BR>Africa which requested such assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is understood that there has recently been some<BR>concern among consultants hired by the foundation over the<BR>possibility of its funds being &quot;misspent&quot; in the volatile<BR>province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The history of German links with Inkatha has reinforced<BR>concern about foreign involvement in moves to create a new<BR>intelligence agency linked to the IFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The developments come amid reports of a hardline draft<BR>constitution drawn up by Inkatha's national leadership that<BR>grants extensive regional powers to KwaZulu- Natal. The draft<BR>IFP document provides for a right to declare provincial<BR>states of emergency and set up a provincial army. It also<BR>places strong controls on the power of the national army to<BR>operate in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Konrad Adenauer Foundation funds, funnelled through the<BR>Institute for Federal Democracy, have been used to pay for a<BR>number of German consultants to help the IFP draft its<BR>constitutional proposals. The latest draft constitution is,<BR>however, believed to have been produced by the IFP in the<BR>face of criticism from the German advisers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe's National Affairs, Employment<BR>Creation and Co-operatives Deputy Minister Gabriel Machinga has said<BR>government is still committed to the idea of a People's Bank and has<BR>already commissioned a study on the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing a Self-Help Development Foundation of Zimbabwe workshop<BR>being attended by 36 co-ordinators and representatives of Savings<BR>Clubs and Co-operatives from the country's eight provinces, Machinga<BR>said the bank would be established after the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four-day workshop begun Monday under the auspices of the<BR>Frederick Adenaur Foundation, will seek ways of making nonMachinga urged workshop participants to come up with<BR>governmental organisations self-financing.<BR>recommendations on strategies the self-help development foundation<BR>could adopt in future regarding credit, social security, training and<BR>counselling so society could stop relying on donors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said particular attention should be paid to the needs of the<BR>disadvantaged in society, such as the disabled, the poor, women and<BR>children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;More than 50 percent of Zimbabwe's population are women, while<BR>female-headed households account for more than a third of all<BR>households, most of which are among the poorest in rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Without a concerted effort to assist and involve them in<BR>development programmes, their situation is likely to worsen,<BR>especially in the light of the ravaging drought currently being<BR>experienced throughout the country and sub-region,&quot; said Machinga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chairman of the self-help development foundation, Gibson<BR>Munyoro, said since its launch in the 1960s, the number of savings<BR>clubs had risen from 30 to 12,000 while membership rose from 200 to<BR>400,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Munyoro said savings clubs were popular because of the scarcity<BR>of banks in many rural areas, high minimum deposits and difficulties<BR>in withdrawing funds from financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Where there are banks, the financial institutions are too rigid<BR>and do not serve the needs of the poor, especially women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Rural people need liberal banking regulations. Co-operatives or<BR>people's banks which can give loans without asking for collateral are<BR>therefore imperative,&quot; said Munyoro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials of similar bank started in Nigeria in 1989 say it now<BR>has 320 branches in 2,700 villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Modelled after the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and the<BR>Neighbourhoood Money Shops in the Philippines, the People's Bank of<BR>Nigeria says it has disbursed some 30 million dollars to more than<BR>460,000 loan beneficiaries, 70 per cent of whom are among the poorest<BR>of some 50 million women in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Individuals or small groups of five people may borrow a minimum of<BR>20 dollars and a maximum of 10,000 dollars repayable in 52 weeks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Somalia was until very recently Africa's biggest breeder<BR>of camels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another factor contributing to the rise of Sudanese livestock<BR>population was the considerable improvement of rainfall conditions<BR>since 1985. These have given rise to good pastures and made up for<BR>the disastrous droughts of the late 1970s and the early 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government in 1991 adopted a programme of economic<BR>liberalisation that deregulated prices of most local products<BR>including meat whose unit price rose by 1000 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Exporters were motivated by continuous revision of the rate of<BR>exchange of the national currency against the dollar, in their<BR>favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides, government troops had since 1992 stormed many strongholds<BR>of the Rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), liberating vast<BR>areas formerly held by the rebels, and thereby improving the life of<BR>farmers and cattle breeders in the resourceful areas of the Blue Nile<BR>and Kordofan districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hassan said the national veterenary laboratory had been able to<BR>manufacture considerable quantities of animal drugs which have<BR>impacted positively on the health of the livestock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan was in 1994 able to export cattle and meat estimated at 37<BR>million dollars. The value rose to 75 million dollars annually in the<BR>1980s, before it dropped drastically in the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts attributed this to the reduction of cattle and camels<BR>imports by neighbouring Egypt and Saudi Arabia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - Africa's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), excluding<BR>South Africa and Nigeria, is projected to tripple this year from 1.2<BR>per cent in 1994, the World Bank says in its 1995 report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report entitled &quot;' A Continent In Transition&quot;, covering the<BR>periods July 1 1994 to June 30 1995, attributes the faster growth to<BR>positive reversals in countries such as Malawi and Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others -- Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Senegal,<BR>and Uganda -- have significantly accelerated the growth of their<BR>economies, it says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although the recovery has been assisted by good weather<BR>conditions and an improvement in the global Economic Environment,<BR>it also reflects changes that augur well for the future, especially a<BR>big Jump in the Region's gross Domestic Investment,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, there were the usual variations among countries: In the<BR>Franc zone, the report says, the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994<BR>has helped put the economies of most of the countries back on the<BR>growth path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;GDP growth turned around by 2.1 percentage points on average for<BR>the thirteen countries of the zone (Excluding Comoros) in 1994,<BR>compared with 1991-93, and became positive for the first time in this<BR>decade. Specifically, growth was positive in ten of the thirteen<BR>countries,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agriculture and industry, it says, has responded with the later<BR>growing by by 6.7 per cent in Cote D'Ivoire. Although export growth<BR>has accelerated, it addds, it remains relatively low because<BR>producer still need time to respond to new opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On specific sectors, the report says there were dramatic<BR>improvement in some activities in 1994, especially in Sahelian<BR>livestock, rice, canned fish, tourism, textiles, and other<BR>manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Cotton production in 1994/95 is up by 50 per cent in Burkina Faso<BR>and Togo and by more than 25 per cent in Mali, and groudnut<BR>production is 40 per cent larger than the year before in Senegal&quot;, it<BR>says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While prices rose sharply in all countries in 1994, for the zone<BR>as a whole inflation was kept below the level anticipated on the<BR>basis of the magnitude of the devaluation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elsewhere, a few countries have experienced declines in real GDP<BR>(Burundi, Malawi, and Zaire, in particular), or near-stagnation<BR>(Nigeria).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several countries registered GDP growth of between 4 per cent and<BR>6 per cent (Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, and<BR>Zimbabwe). For some, growth in this range was for the second, third,<BR>or fourth year in a row.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A Continent In Transition&quot; points out that 21 countries achieved<BR>positive per capital income growth during 1988-93.<BR> This trend continued and spread in 1994, especially in countries<BR>implementing economic reform programs, which, it adds, deserve to be<BR>supported by the donor community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - The Zambian government, which says it intends to<BR>pass a law to hang copper thieves to protect the mineral from<BR>reported increased thefts, has now banned exports of scrap metal<BR>which it says had been used as cover to smuggle copper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy Mines Minister Ackim Nkole said Sunday in the northern<BR>region copper-mining town of Kitwe that government had discovered<BR>that scrap metal business had been used by some unscrupulous dealers<BR>to hide and ship out stolen copper.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most Zambian scrap metal dealers mainly export to neighbouring<BR>Zimbabwe and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We know what they are doing. They bury copper in a heap of scrap<BR>which they declare&quot;, said Nkole who announced that government<BR>intended to legislate copper and cobalt thefts into capital offences<BR>to deter thefts of the country's major foreign exchange-earning<BR>minerals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia earns the bulk of its foreign exchange from copper and some<BR>cobalt, by-product of copper ore also produced in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Minisater of Mines, Keli Walubita recently set up a crack<BR>anti-metal theft police unit in the mining region to curb the thefts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, the government set up a gemstone auction centre in the<BR>capital, Lusaka, to supervise sales of the country's precious stones<BR>currently mined by private small scale investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The auction centre will ensure orderly sales of the stones and<BR>enable government recover tax.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MACHEKE, Zimbabwe - The International Breastfeeding Code meant to<BR>improve the nutritional status of infants is having a negative impact<BR>in Zimbabwe as it contributes to malnutrition among orphaned infants<BR>who no longer have easy access to breastmilk substitutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A nursing sister in Zimbabwe's Murewa district said in an<BR>interview that because baby-milk companies had stopped donations to<BR>hospitals and clinics, surviving relatives, most of them destitute<BR>and aged grandparents, encountered insurmountable problems sourcing<BR>the highly priced substitutes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hospitals, she said, could no longer provide milk formula and<BR>advised relatives to register the orphaned infants with Zimbabwe's<BR>department of social welfare for monetary assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The little babies suffer because of the delays at welfare to<BR>register them and at the end of the day they become malnourished,&quot;<BR>she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While not ruling out that the increasing number of women dying in<BR>child-birth could be related to HIV infection, she said the trend was<BR>cause for worry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - Like it affects the economy, labour<BR>force, as well as women and children, the HIV/AIDS pandemic also has<BR>severe demographic consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the pandemic takes its toll, the increased levels of morbidity<BR>and mortality will certainly affect Africa's already overstretched<BR>health infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;...living in an HIV/AIDS environment will most certainly lead to<BR>heightened levels of mortality, hence higher estimates of crude death<BR>rate or infant mortality rate and reduced life span,&quot; says Kampion<BR>Banda of the population division of the Economic Commission for<BR>Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Large proportions of young adult parents succumbing to aids will<BR>leave behind an equally large group of orphans with little economic<BR>support for themselves and grandparents,&quot; Banda told a seminar on the<BR>socio-economic impact of the HIV/AIDS on households and families in<BR>Africa which opened in Addis Ababa Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa is today the hardest hit region by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations estimates that in the 15 hardest hit<BR>countries in Africa, including Uganda, Kenya, Zaire, Zambia, Rwanda,<BR>Tanzania, Cote d'Ivoire, Malawi and Zimbabwe, some two million people<BR>would have been killed by the pandemic by the year 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, between 1990 and the year 2005, about eight years of<BR>life expectancy will be lost in these countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda said for Africa as a whole, life expectancy will fall<BR>gradually as a result of AIDS, and will remain below the set target<BR>of 60 in the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Africa will therefore delay by 10-20 years before achieving its<BR>set target,&quot; said Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added, the &quot;eastern sub-region will have lost most years in<BR>life expectancy and may not easily gain until the year 2020 and<BR>beyond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If adequate and carefully designed preventive measures are not<BR>taken in the whole region then the population growth rate in Africa<BR>may decline from roughly 3 per cent to 2 per cent per annum. The<BR>crude death rate will increase to 21 per 1000 in 1995-2000, while<BR>life expectancy will drop from 51 to 43 years on the average, says<BR>Wambui Karanja of the ECA's socio-economic research and planning<BR>division told the seminar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fertility is yet another component of population growth likely to<BR>be affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While some infected people may attempt to have many children in<BR>the hope that some may be seronegative and survive, there is the<BR>possibility of fertility decline through... a delay in first<BR>marriage, the erosion of the numbers of women in the prime<BR>childbearing years, a reduction in sexual activity during the<BR>symptomatic phase, and widespread use of condoms to prevent<BR>infection,&quot; Karanja told the experts, policy makers and practitioners<BR>who ended their seminar Wednesday.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KHARTOUM, Sudan - Conventional wisdom in the Sudanese capital<BR>Khartoum is that &quot;if you have a broken bone or dislocation go to '<BR>Bit Bati' .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zeinab Mustafa Ahmed, popularly known as Bit Bati (daughter of<BR>Bati), has inherited the skill of bone-healing from her father and<BR>gained wide fame in a country that still trusts traditional medicine .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zeinab, over 80, claims to have cured many Sudanese and foreign<BR>notables who came to her home for treatment after modern medicine had<BR>failed to cure their pains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with Khartoum's Arabic language tabloid ' Addar'<BR>Tuesday, the traditional healer said she uses her bare hands to<BR>detect what is wrong with a human body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I remember that during a traditional medicine conference I was<BR>asked how I could distinguish a dislocation from a broken bone. I<BR>said my hands can do better than X-ray,&quot; she boasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She says the world of sport, especially football teams, had kept<BR>her well supplied with customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite her admiration of Sudan's famous Hilal Football Team, she<BR>boasts, she treats its players on an equal footing with players from<BR>other teams -- in keeping with her humanitarian mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When asked whether she had managed to transfer her skills to<BR>other members of her family, as did her father to her, Zeinab said<BR>she was sorry not to have taught the secrets of the trade to any of<BR>her sons and daughters because they were too busy with their<BR>education and away from home for longer period. However, one of her<BR>younger sisters can perform some not very complicated jobs, she says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KIGALI, Rwanda - The Rwandan civil war, which started in October<BR>1990, has not only caused human deaths but also severely damaged the<BR>country's fauna and other natural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Particularly damaged during the fighting between the Rwandese<BR>Patriotic Front and the regular government army of the late Gen.<BR>Juvenal Habyariman, were the fauna and infrastructure of the Kagera<BR>National Park in the north and the Mutara game hunting reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The damage occured in the course of massive population movements,<BR>as people tried to escape from the combatants or to seek temporary<BR>shelter and relative calm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The destruction went unhindered because the park's wardens had<BR>to run away fromn Gabiro further South to Kayonra, to save their<BR>lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The withdrawal of the rangers opened the area to penetration by<BR>poachers who joined the displaced population and soldiers in the<BR>plunder of animals and other resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The five-year old civil war also negatively impacted on<BR>Agriculture because peasants were forced to neglect or abandon their<BR>farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among park's most damaged infrastructures is Gabiro Guest House,<BR>one of the previously protected area's two magnificent hotels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The guest house changed hands several times as the RPF and the<BR>government army battled for power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation in the park deteriorated even further by October<BR>1994 as the plunder of equipment and destruction engulfed the entire<BR>zone. Among the infrastructures which suffered around this time were<BR>the fisheries equipment on the shores of Lake Ihema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwanda possesses two two national parks- the Kagera National<BR>Park within which is located the Mutara Hunting sancuary- and the<BR>Volcanos National Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kagera national Park is located in Northestern Rwanda close<BR>to the mouth of the Kagera river, from which its name derives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This park dates back to 1934 and was established on marginal<BR>lands with low human activity.The area is infested by the tse-tse<BR>flies and has a dry climate suitable for wildlife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kagera Park and the Mutara Hunting zone cover over 285,000<BR>hectares in which a wide diversity of fauna, including<BR>antelopes,leopards, zebras, buffaloes, elephants, lions and giraffes<BR>used to roam freely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mutara Hunting sanctuary was an alternative home for the<BR>wildlife from the Kagera national park. The animals used to migrate<BR>there annually in search of water and pasture.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - With rising input costs beyond the reach of<BR>many communal farmers, an organisation promoting permaculture has<BR>said ' natural farming' methods could restore Zimbabwe as a leading<BR>food producer in southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the recurrent droughts have been attributed to inadequate<BR>rainfall, Enita Chimanikire of the country's Natural Farming Network<BR>(NFN) said yields had been affected by the soil's increased<BR>dependency on chemicals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Right now most of the soils in Zimbabwe cannot produce anything<BR>without the introduction of chemicals like fertilisers,&quot; Chimanikire<BR>said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said NFN was training farmers to revert to old fashioned<BR>agriculture of crop rotation, composts and inter-cropping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, because of the damage done to the soil by chemicals, at<BR>least four or five years were needed for the soil to recover before<BR>benefits of the natural farming methods could be felt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The method had proved effective with small gardens and initial<BR>trials to test suitability on large tracts of land had yielded<BR>positive results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Composts work for small gardens, but for large fields, we always<BR>say farmers should plant maybe maize, legumes and other crops to<BR>promote inter-croping and improve nutrition,&quot; said the<BR>permaculturist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sometimes worms had to be introduced to speed up decomposition<BR>and eventually enrich the impoverished soil and plants like mustard<BR>that attracted pest eating insects were grown to boost this<BR>ecological system.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - Countries in the drought-prone Southern Africa<BR>Development Community (SADC) region need t invest more money in food<BR>production and harness more water to avert starvation, an<BR>agricultural economist has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regional Early Warning Unit (REWU) project co-ordinator Tendai<BR>Masundire said in an interview that the region lost a lot of water<BR>during the rain season when most rivers were in flood and the water<BR>was left to flow away.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The region has experienced recurrent droughts, the last major one<BR>being in 1991 when rains stopped prematurely, resulting in severe<BR>food shortages. This forced nearly all countries to make massive<BR>importation of grain worth millions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> REWU projected a regional cereal deficit of 3.91 million tonnes<BR>for the 1995/96 marketing year and noted that SADC countries had<BR>embarked on drought relief and rehabilitation programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The only way out of these chronic droughts is to harness the<BR>available water and put more money into food production like<BR>irrigation,&quot; said Masundire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said before the 1991 drought, countries did not readily use<BR>information from REWU, adding that the attitude was changing and the<BR>unit was flooded with requests for forecasts on harvests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attitude change, he said was possibly out of realisation that<BR>adequate planning and preparation was essential if a drought was<BR>imminent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAPUTO, Mozambique - The Zimbabwean authorities have pledged not<BR>to divert massive amounts of water from th Pungue river for<BR>irrigation purposes without first conducting a thorough environmental<BR>impact assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This promise came at a meeting in the central Mozambican city of<BR>Beira on Wednesday between Mozambique's Minister of Public works and<BR>Housing, Roberto White, and the Zimbabwean Minister of Land and<BR>Water, Kumbirai Kangai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique has complained vigorously at Zimbabwean plans to<BR>divert 70 million cubic metres of water a year from the Pungue to its<BR>Save Valley for irrigated agriculture.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plan would dramatically reduce the amount of Pungue water<BR>flowing into Mozambique. cited by the Beira paper ' Diario de<BR>Mocambique', White said this would affect Beira's water supply, the<BR>irrigation systems on the lower Pungue, and the Pungue estuary<BR>ecosystem, which is a nursery for prawns, one of Mozambique's main<BR>exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even without the Zimbabwean scheme, the Pungue can fall to<BR>dangerously low levels in the dry season. As a result seawater<BR>penetrates far upstream. Beira's water supply had previously been<BR>interrupted because the salt content of the water at the pumping<BR>station was too high for human consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two ministers signed a protocol establishing a joint<BR>commission on water resources of common interest to the two<BR>countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pungue diversion scheme is thus postponed, perhaps<BR>indefinitely. Kangai told reporters that Zimbabwe would not advance<BR>with the project without Mozambique's consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the ministers did agreed that Zimbabwe could take what<BR>kangai described as &quot;a small amount of water&quot; from the Pungue to<BR>supply its eastern city of Mutare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;According to environmental studies, this will not have any<BR>impact,&quot; claimed the Zimbabwean minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The amount involved, however, is 25 million cubic metres a year,<BR>which is far from negligible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique and Zimbabwe will now seek donor funds to carry out a<BR>thorough study of the entire pungue basin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe - International companies have started lobbying<BR>for the proposed construction of a pipeline to draw water from the<BR>Zambezi River to Zimbabwe's drought-stricken Matabeleland region in a<BR>project estimated to cost Zimdollars 2 billion (USD 235.3 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coordinator of the Matabeleland Zambezi Water Trust (MZWT),<BR>championing the implementation of the project, Kingsley Dube, said in<BR>an interview companies from as far afield as Britain, France, Japan<BR>and Scandinavia were continuously inquiring on how they could<BR>participate in the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But we are telling them to hold their horses until full results<BR>of feasibility studies on the project are out in November,&quot; Dube<BR>said. Should results of the Swedish-conducted studies to determine<BR>possibilities of piping water from the Zambezi over 400 kilometres to<BR>the north be affirmative, Dube said, the MZWT would then go to tender<BR>for construction purposes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have not earmarked any company for the job. We will take the<BR>best bidder considering the actual cost of the project,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initial results showed the project was feasible although experts<BR>were yet to work out finer engineering details such as size, location<BR>of the pipeline and exact cost of the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The israelis had already invited MZWT trustees to attend workshops<BR>on water in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MZWT was formed to lobby government to implement the project,<BR>widely viewed as a lifeline by industrialists in this semi-arid<BR>region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bulawayo, once Zimbabwe's industrial capital, imposed strict water<BR>rationing with deterrent penalties early this year to try and stretch<BR>meagre supplies in its reservoirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the peak of a drought in 1992/93, some companies pulled up the<BR>stakes, laid off thousands of workers, and relocated operations to<BR>places where permanent water supplies were guaranteed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agricultural experts say the project would also enhance Zimbabwe's<BR>food security as 57 000 hectares of land is envisaged to come under<BR>irrigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GENEVA - The Third Conference of the Parties to the Basel<BR>Convention on the Control of Transboundar Movements of Hazardous<BR>Wastes has ended in Geneva with a ban on the export of hazardous<BR>wastes from developed countries (OECD members) to developing ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This amendment was tough to negotiate, but we finally succeeded<BR>in serving the interests of the environment,&quot; said Bakary Kante,<BR>chairman and Director of Environment in Senagal's environment<BR>ministry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ban on wastes destined for recovery or recycling operations<BR>will be phased in before taking complete effect after 31 December<BR>1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Support for the measure was based on the need to protect<BR>developing countries from unwanted imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Developing countries lack the financial, technical, legal and<BR>institutional capacity for monitoring the transboundary movement of<BR>hazardous wastes and preventing illegal imports,&quot; says the United<BR>Nations Environment Programme said in a communique at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;An export ban will help to remedy the weakness of these<BR>countries' existing import bans. It will also act as an incentive to<BR>minimize the generation of hazardous wastes at source,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate over the ban was complicated by the difficulties in<BR>classifying a number of wastes in the Convention and the<BR>characteristics that make them hazardous. Further work is still<BR>needed on this. The Technical Working Group will meet next year to<BR>examine such technical questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States is not yet a party to the convention although<BR>it is participating fully in its work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The treaty was adopted in March 1989 and came into force in May<BR>1992. It has been ratified by 91 countries and the European Union.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a report just released by the European Commission, a<BR>total of 32.5 million metric tonnes of Nigeria's high grade light<BR>crude were exported to European markets in 1994, up by 21 per cent<BR>from 26.8 million metric tonnes in 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report says Nigeria led an African domination of oil<BR>exporters to the EU market, moving from a 25.6 per cent share in 1993<BR>to 27.3 per cent in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil accounts for some 90 per cent of Nigeria's total foreign<BR>exchange earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report said total OPEC exports of crude and feedstocks to<BR>Europe was 253 million metric tonnes in 1994, a 7.6-per-cent decrease<BR>in the organisation's share of the EU's overall oil imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, energy experts say the special preference for the high<BR>grade crude from Nigeria, Libya and Algeria by European refiners,<BR>might have accounted for the rise in demand for oil from the African<BR>countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria has come under pressure from some EU members and the<BR>United States over its political crisis, but oil companies in the<BR>country are not towing the hard line of their home governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In September for instance, TEXACO of the United States changed<BR>its earlier plans to divest from Nigeria, saying the economic<BR>environment is now profitable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - Former President of the African Development Bank,<BR>Babacar Ndiaye, plans to sent up a foundation estimated to cost 2.7<BR>million US dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports reaching PANA said the outfit, to be called ' African<BR>Foundation For Enabling Stability and Growth (AFESAG)' , will be<BR>based in Abidjan, capital of Cote d'Ivoire which also hosts the ADB.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objective of the non-profit foundation will be to foster<BR>social stability and reinforce economic development in Africa, a<BR>reliable source told PANA on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ndiaye, said to be presently seeking donations for the body,<BR>stepped down as ADB president in August after serving two five-year<BR>terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His reputation as an astitute banker was crowned in 1988 when the<BR>bank was rated among the best development finance institutions in the<BR>world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Senegalese national also helped establish the African Business<BR>Round Table (ABR), a loose association of eminent African<BR>enterpreneurs, and the African Export-Import (AFREXIM) Bank, based in<BR>Cairo, Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Ndiaye's popularity suffered considerably in the last two<BR>years of his tenure following persistent quarrels with the executive<BR>directors of the bank who accused him of mismanagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He made a passing reference to the bad blood between him and the<BR>directors in one of two books released in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You know, my dear friend, we must tell the chief what he wants to<BR>hear...this is the secret for longevity and promotion,&quot; he said in a<BR>dialogue with an unidentified friend in ' La BAD, L'Afrique et Moi'<BR>(the ADB, Africa and Me).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts say Ndiaye was referring to what is often termed '<BR>Politics of the Belly' , a rationale for mthe crookery that has<BR>seriously undermined many African institutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - An agreement to allow preferential access of<BR>Zimbabwean clothing and textile exports into South Africa is unlikely<BR>to come into force before the end of the month, as earlier envisaged,<BR>experts said on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview, chief executive of the Confederation of Zimbabwe<BR>Industries, Joe Foroma, said South Africa was still studying<BR>Zimbabwe's proposals for preferential treatment of its clothing and<BR>textile exports, further delaying the implementation of the<BR>agreement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was now unlikely the agreement would become effective before<BR>the end of October this year as agreed in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foroma, who was part of a Zimbabwean private sector delegation<BR>that met with representatives of business South Africa in<BR>Johannesburg last week, said the South Africans were still making<BR>their own internal consultations on Zimbabwe's proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the moment they have not declined the proposals although it is<BR>unlikely the agreement will come into force by the agreed date,&quot;<BR>Foroma said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South Africans had in principle offered preferential access of<BR>Zimbabwean clothing and textile exports into South Africa at<BR>preference rates as close as possible to the situation that prevailed<BR>before December 31, 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A technical group was to work out the details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African textile manufacturers are however bitterly opposed<BR>to any deal with Zimbabwe, a situation that has caused the delays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African Textile Federation executive director, Brian Brink<BR>said in a telephone interview from Johannesburg that the industry in<BR>South Africa was generally opposed to any agreement that would result<BR>in Zimbabwean textiles and clothing inundating their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African manufacturers have argued that their industry is<BR>still very young, and not yet ready for complete exposure to external<BR>competition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - Farrakhan, Savimbi, Kaunda, Sankara -- all are<BR>colourful figures who have again grabbed the attention of African<BR>newspapers and most likely, their readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Louis Farrakhan's Million Man March in Washington D.C. to affirm<BR>self respect of African American men prodded Sud Quotidien (South<BR>Daily), a privately owned daily in Dakar, Senegal, into comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said while African Americans were subject to a range of abuses<BR>and had disproportionate numbers in prison, they were also snared by<BR>views such as those propounded by Farrakhan. These, it said, include<BR>the belief that women should stay at home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But beyond this,&quot; it said, &quot;is the importance of (pride in)<BR>ethnic identity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it noted that ethnicity had caused wars in Africa and<BR>Bosnia, as well as xenophobia in France and Italy. Coupled with the<BR>growth and spread of unemployment worldwide ethnicity, it suggested,<BR>had become a threat to peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Poverty has caught up with the middle classes and this has become<BR>fertile ground for all sorts of extremists,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such extremist tendencies have refelected themselves in the effort<BR>to expel Zambia's first president, Kenneth Kaunda, from the country.<BR>He is experiencing even worse political humiliation than Cote<BR>d'Ivoire's Alassane Ouattara, who was also declared ineligible for<BR>the country's presidential elections for the same reason as Kaunda:<BR>lineage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In today's Africa, there are ambiguities and contradictions<BR>intermingled with derisory confusion caused by the very people who<BR>claim to be the champions of African unity,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the monopoly over state media and the nationality laws<BR>passed to bar the likes of Ouattara, A.M. News said, &quot;Sunday's<BR>election...appears already a concluded affair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, the Lagos paper added, was especially so with the opposition<BR>insisting it would boycott the polls if the electoral rules are not<BR>changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What President Bedie must do to prevent the degeneration of this<BR>landmark election into a farce and a sham is to ease his party's<BR>reign on the state apparatus and allow for a trully free and fair<BR>election without the intervention of frivolous statutes,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Ivory Coast should break the myth of Africa as a continent<BR>antithetical to democracy by giving the opposition a chance of<BR>participating in Sunday's election,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State-owned Sidwaya of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, said that<BR>Ivorian candidates were focused much more on personal conflict than<BR>on the issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Henri Bedie can deflate the crisis, Sidwaya said, by<BR>reopening talks with the opposition and agreeing to postpone voting.<BR>This measure, it said, would not be a sign of weakness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prelude to the elections, it said, will be difficult for a<BR>usually calm Cote D'Ivoire. The paper urged the protagonists to show<BR>greater tolerance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ouagadougou dailies also commented on the eighth anniversary of<BR>the assassination of the Burkina Faso leader, Capt. Thomas Sankara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The privately owned Le Pays (the Country) noted that through sheer<BR>determination, Sankara had built housing estates for the poor and<BR>instilled values of hard work and a &quot;can do&quot; mentality in Burkina<BR>Faso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But as years went by the man allowed power to get to him and<BR>began displaying some tyranical tendencies,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government-owned Zambia Daily Mail focused on former Angolan<BR>rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It praised him for agreeing to join the country's proposed<BR>government of national unity but doubted Savimbi would really allow a<BR>younger UNITA official to accept the second vice presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If UNITA chooses another leader it will be a dramatic decision<BR>which will put a completely new face on Angolan politics. However, we<BR>are not sure whether Dr. Savimbi's reason for stepping aside to give<BR>room to an energetic young man is real,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Savimbi's readiness to cede the number three spot in the<BR>government was, he said, due to fatigue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If this is true, then there is something up his sleeve. We doubt<BR>that Dr Savimbi can sit down and watch the game being played without<BR>his influence,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Savimbi's Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA,<BR>signed a peace accord with Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos<BR>of the ruling MPLA in 1994 to end that country's almost two decades<BR>of civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations-brokered ' Lusaka Protocol' also provides for<BR>a transitional government of national unity to be followed by<BR>presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For its part, the Ethiopian Herald commented on the 50th<BR>anniversary of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In a world of numerous philosophies and as many theories of the<BR>world's problems, the golden jubilee of the UN serves to bring people<BR>closer together in attaining the ultimate goal -- a better world to<BR>live in,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to peacekeeping it said, &quot;there's virtually no sector&quot;<BR>in which the UN does not play a major role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And as it celeberates its 50th anniversary the people of the<BR>world hope its activities will be boosted even more in the coming<BR>years,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania (PANA) - October has been a month of<BR>tranquility for fish in Mauritanian following a temporary ban on<BR>their extraction from all over the West African country's<BR>territorial waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The monthly biological pause,supposed to give various species an<BR>opportunity to multiply, was accepted by Noauckchott after<BR>persistent reports by scintists indicated overfishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For several years the government had received warnings that fish<BR>catches were declining.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To prevent the situation from worsening, experts at the<BR>Mauritanian National Oceanographic Research Centre recommended that<BR>the governemnt should introduce an annual month-long ban in small<BR>and large scale deep sea fishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The month of October was chosen because specialists know it as<BR>the period of reproduction and post-reproduction for fishes in this<BR>part of the west African coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is hoped this biological pause will facilitate a regeneration<BR>of endangered especies and subsquently improve catches, says Mr<BR>Yahya Ould Attigh, the Director of Industrial Fishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A good number of fish species in Mauritanian waters are coveted<BR>by European and Japanese commercial fishing firms who accepted the<BR>monthly ban with misgivings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, knowing what was at stake, Mauritanian authorities<BR>adopted an inflexible position regarding the biolgical pause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was reiterated by president Maouya Ould Sid'Ahmed when he<BR>told an interviewer in Paris, France, that the pause was a sovereign<BR>decision taken upon the advise of scientists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government's firm position is based on the fact that the<BR>fisheries sector accounts for between 50 and 60 per cent of<BR>Mauritania's export earnings and between 20 and 25 per cent of<BR>government revenue. Its contribution to the Gross Domestic Product<BR>is between 10 and 15 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Proponents of the fishing ban argue that, even if it momentarily<BR>deprives the country of immediate earnings, the future benefits will<BR>be greater when more fishes are allowed to reproduce and increase<BR>their sizes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japanese fish merchants, for example, are known for their<BR>penchant for big fish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other advantage is that the one month period gives<BR>shipowners ample time to rehabilitate their fishing gear ready for a<BR>new start on 1 November 1995.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia, in the throes of a crippling drought<BR>over the past several months, could experience a virtual halt of<BR>economic activites within the next month, unless the unexpected<BR>happens.<BR> Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) the country's major<BR>supplier of hydro-electric power warned last week that it might be<BR>forced to shut down its Kariba North Bank within 45 days if the<BR>current water level in the dam drops further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to ZESCO officials, the water level is receding at a<BR>daily rate of one centimetre and there are fears that operations<BR>could grind to a halt if it fell by a further 1.5 metres below the<BR>current level of 475 metres, which is the minimum capable of turning<BR>the turbines for power generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kariba North Bank dam is losing a minimum of 10 centimetres of<BR>water everyday, according to ZESCO communications manager Lucy Zimba<BR>who has said that a maximum of 487 metres of water is needed for<BR>normal generation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the loss of water continues and reaches 474 metres, there<BR>will not be enough to turn the turbines,&quot; said Zimba who added that<BR>the situation could only return to normal by April 1996 even if<BR>there was rain this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Itezhitezhi hydro-electric dam on the Kafue river also in the<BR>south is facing similar water problems. It currently has 1,006<BR>metres of water, barely 10 metres above the minimum level for power<BR>generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia currently imports about 2 million dollars worth of<BR>electricity every month from neighbouring Zaire and ZESCO has said<BR>that it will surcharge both industrial and domestic customers who<BR>exceed their allocated electiricty quotas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The southern African country has experienced intermittent drought<BR>in the past six seasons with the worst being the 1991/92 season<BR>which affected almost the entire southern African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prospects of another dry spell this year has made most Zambians<BR>unusually desperate as the current water shortage in most parts of<BR>the country, particularly in the south, continues to bite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports from Namwala in souterhn Zambia said last week that<BR>teachers at one school have stopped work in protest against lack of<BR>water at their institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Luanshya, in the northern copperbelt, inmates at a prison are<BR>said to be walking 16 kilometres to fetch water while some villagers<BR>in the worst hit southern region are said to have started trecking<BR>northwards in search of water for their cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Lusaka, the capital, worshippers of various churches last<BR>weekend set aside their &quot;religous differences&quot; and converged at the<BR>Anglican Cathedral of the Holy Cross to pray for adequate rains this<BR>season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their prayers seemed to have been partially answered when Lusaka<BR>had traces of rainfall last Friday with reports from other parts of<BR>the country also indicating that there could be normal rains this<BR>year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both traditional and conventional weather forecasters are<BR>generally agreed that Zambia and the rest of southern Africa is<BR>poised to receive adequate rains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traditional weather watchers normally base their predictions on<BR>movements of certain birds, ants and other animal species and the<BR>presence or absence of some plants just before the rains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some parts of the country have reported the arrival of swarms of<BR>the swallow which both scientists and traditionalists say is a<BR>harbinger of &quot;good rain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Theo Dohse, research manager at the Pretoria-based Agriculture<BR>Research Centre in South Africa who attended an international<BR>agriculture seminar in Lusaka last week told PANA that most farmers<BR>in South Africa were preparing for a normal wet season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to him, their hope is based on a little local bird<BR>known in the Afrikaans language as ' quiquit' which, he says, only<BR>lays one egg prior to a dry year. it is laying up to six eggs this<BR>year, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of southern Africa receives rains between November and<BR>April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meteorologists in the sub-region are also making similar<BR>predictions. It would appear the gods, science and nature would want<BR>to collaborate to send down the rain and breach the spell of drought<BR>afflicting this part of an already blighted Africa, one of them said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - The Zimbabwe Women Finance Trust (ZWFT) has<BR>now disbursed 501 loans benefiting 353 families since the inception<BR>of its direct lending programme in 1992, National Affairs Employment<BR>Creation and Co-operatives Minister Florence Chitauro has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening the Women World Banking (WWB) Africa region meeting in<BR>Harare on Monday, Chitauro said 70 percent of the loans were in the<BR>rural areas where a greater part of the disadvantaged women lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well over 2,000 participants had also been trained, 65 percent of<BR>them in business management and 35 percent in business creation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 75 percent of those trained in business creation had managed to<BR>start their own businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZWFT is affiliated to WWB, an international organisation<BR>established in 1975 to address the needs of women in micro and small<BR>business around the world, particularly those who have not had access<BR>to credit, savings instruments, markets and business know-how.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Trust receives technical and financial assistance from nonDevelopment Agency (SIDA), Care International Zimbabwe and African<BR>governmental organisations such as the Swedish International<BR>Development Fund to enable it execute its mandate of uplifting the<BR>status of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chitauro said there was need to find alternative sources of<BR>finance for women's businesses as most financial institutions in<BR>Africa still discriminated against women in the provision of loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concrete action plans were therefore needed to achieve the<BR>economic empowerment of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is only through these efforts that issues of poverty<BR>alleviation among women can seriously be considered by national<BR>governments,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK - The Mozambican government and the American company<BR>Enron will soon sign a contract for the exploitation of the natural<BR>gas reserves at Pande in the southern Mozambican province of<BR>Inhambane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking in New York, where he is attending the United Nations'<BR>50th anniversary celebrations, Mozambican president Joaquim Chissano<BR>announced that Enron is prepared to invest &quot;hundreds of millions of<BR>dollars&quot; in the gas project, which involves building a pipeline from<BR>Pande to South Africa, the only conceivable market for the gas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A source close to the negotiations, the most recent phase of<BR>which took place last week in Washington, said that Enron could spend<BR>between USD 400 million and 600 million on the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a dinner offered by the company's managing director, Rebecca<BR>Mark, Chissano stressed that exploiting the natural gas is part of<BR>the Mozambican government's five year economic programme and that<BR>the revenue it generates will be key to the country's development<BR>and to improving the social conditions of the Mozambican people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chissano urged more American businessmen to invest in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the wide range of investment possibilities in the country<BR>covered mining, agriculture and tourism while Mozambican legislation<BR>offers excellent benefits to foreign investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chissano's words seem to end the speculation in Maputo that the<BR>contract with Enron will not be signed, either because the South<BR>Africans are not happy with the eventual price of the gas, or<BR>because Enron will not accept conditions demanded by the Mozambican<BR>side.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - A delegation of the world's soccer governing<BR>body, FIFA is due in Nigeria next month for activities marking 50<BR>years of the popular sport in the west African country, a Nigerian<BR>soccer official said Monday. According to the spokesman, the<BR>delegation to be led by FIFA President Joao Havelange is due in<BR>Nigeria 7 November at the invitation of the Nigerian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria, African champions are celebrating the golden jubilee of<BR>football, a sport that has brought international repute to the<BR>country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The FIFA delegation is expected to use the visit to resolve its<BR>dispute with Nigeria after the soccer supreme authority took away the<BR>hosting right of the Under-17 World Cup from the west African<BR>country early this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FIFA, citing security reasons, cancelled Nigeria's bid in April<BR>for the 16-nation youth tournament, which it later awarded to the<BR>Gulf State of Qatar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In protest, Nigeria declined a FIFA invitation to participate in<BR>the competition, to put a further strain on relations between the<BR>country and FIFA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cancellation provoked anti-FIFA sentiments on the continent,<BR>with the African Football Confederation (CAF), calling it an<BR>&quot;injustice,&quot; after Nigeria had spent millions of dollars to upgrade<BR>its soccer facilities for the aborted tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's achievements in soccer are legion. They include<BR>winning the Africa Cup of Nations twice. The country's talented<BR>players feature in the world's top continental leagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nation's senior team, the super eagles, appeared in the<BR>World Cup for the first time and gave a good account of themselves<BR>in the United States also in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's under-17 side has won the world championship twice in<BR>1985 and 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the country has of late seen its soccer fortunes decline at<BR>the senior category mainly from poor management resulting in dismal<BR>international engagements and inaction after the 1994 World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team managed a consoling 3-2 away victory against former<BR>soviet member-state Uzbekistan, in the first leg of their Afro-Asian<BR>tie last Saturday. The return leg comes up in Lagos in November.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Harare, during the All Africa Games, the CAF president told a<BR>&quot;New Vision&quot; journalist that Uganda will be thrown out of CAF interMimosa.  and according to Hayatou, FUFA had to pay all the US$ 90,000<BR>clubs competitions unless they paid all the monies owed to Asec<BR>agreed on originally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FUFA chairman Twaha Kakaire confirmed yesterday that FUFA had<BR>received the message through Dr. James Sekagugo who was requested by<BR>FUFA to contact Hayatou currently in Cameroon to find out the<BR>official CAF stand on the debt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This will probably end the misunderstanding between FUFA and CAF<BR>of how much FUFA still has to pay Asec Mimosa. Originally, a flat<BR>figure of US$ 90,000(UShs 90m) was presented to Uganda as the cost of<BR>SC Villa's failure to honour the return leg match, but after friendly<BR>negotiations between former FUFA boss Moses Ali and soccer officials<BR>from Cote d'Ivoire, the fine was reduced to US $60,000(UShs 60m) and<BR>the last installment of US$ 4,500 was paid September 25, at least<BR>according to a release by Peter Wasula last night at Nakivubo<BR>Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, Peter Wasula the man responsible for the collection and<BR>remittance of the Asec debt funds said he had so far remitted $60,000<BR>(Sh 60.m)beating the October 10, deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's High Commissioner to London, Professor George B. Kirya,<BR>has meanwhile also contacted the Ivorian government over the matter--<BR>and his opposite number in the UK has promised action as soon as<BR>possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Posta and Kobs coach Asuman Lubowa has been picked to<BR>participate in the fourth coming FIFA(CAF elite coaching course,<BR>October 14 in Cairo, Egypt.<BR>...According to FUFA General Secretary Chris Rwanika, Lubowa was<BR>picked because he is the national youth coach. &quot;We have already<BR>received his ticket from CAF,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The course will run from October 14-20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What FUFA did not say is who will take over the Uganda Kobs from<BR>Asuman Lubowa when the team resume training for the East and Central<BR>African Senior Challenge Cup due next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have not yet decided, but we shall sit and find a solution,&quot;<BR>Rwanika told &quot;The Monitor&quot; yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>October 6, 1995<BR>by Samantha Weinberg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - When &quot;Colonel&quot; Bob Denard rose from the ashes of<BR>his mercenary career, bolder and ballsier than ever, he raised a<BR>finger in the air to the French judicial system, political pundits<BR>and keepers of the &quot;new world order&quot;. With Africa marching -- albeit<BR>shakily -- towards democracy, he retook a country, captured a<BR>president and installed in his place a military junta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The timing may have been unexpected, but the coup itself was not.<BR>When I last met Bob Denard, in a Paris hotel the day after he had<BR>been given a five- year suspended sentence for his role in a failed<BR>coup attempt in Benin in 1977, he was full of confidence. There had<BR>been another coup in the Comoros, he informed me, led by the twin<BR>sons of former president Abdallah, and foiled by the Comorian army<BR>and their French military advisers. The Abdallahs had been imprisoned<BR>along with prominent former ministers, and the populace was up in<BR>arms. &quot;Ask the people of the Comoros what they think of me now,&quot; he<BR>bellowed. &quot;Don't you think they would like the Colonel back now?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Denard's continued existence as a mercenary leader has always owed<BR>more to immense self-confidence than to military prowess. His career<BR>is littered with the corpses of failed coups: the 1977 Benin<BR>debacle, when a hurried retreat resulted in cases of documents<BR>detailing plans for the action being left on the runway, and a comic<BR>attempt soon after to invade Zaire with a hundred men on bicycles.<BR>Yet the mercenaries -- typically army and society drop- outs, often<BR>brutal and ill-educated -- kept signing up to join him. And so the<BR>myth of his power grew, until he believed it himself, absolutely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Comoros had been his first great success. In 1975, he toppled<BR>the new president, Ahmed Abdallah, and replaced him with a young<BR>revolutionary, Ali Soilih. Three years later, Soilih was acting in an<BR>increasingly erratic fashion -- he had sacked the civil service,<BR>burnt all records and turned the running of the country over to<BR>teenagers with guns. On being warned by his favourite witchdoctor<BR>that he would be killed by a white man with a black dog, he promptly<BR>ordered the slaughter of all dogs on the islands. The medicine man's<BR>prophecy turned out to be true: On May 13 1978, Denard, accompanied<BR>by 46 men and a black alsatian dog, stormed the islands at dawn,<BR>killing Soilih &quot;as he tried to escape&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Abdallah back in power and dependent on Denard and his force<BR>to keep him there, the &quot;Colonel&quot; relaxed. He married a local beauty<BR>(his sixth wife), built a number of homes and developed a paunch.<BR>Pretoria provided the finance for the mercenary-led Presidential<BR>Guard -- and in return, it seems most likely, used the Comoros as an<BR>entrepot for the smuggling of arms to Iran. The old Dog of War was<BR>content, and it was his intention to stay on his island paradise for<BR>the rest of his days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Abdallah, however, under pressure from the French and<BR>local grandees -- and with the spectre of a withdrawal of South<BR>African support under a new regime looming large -- had other ideas.<BR>One evening in November1989, after he told Denard that he had to<BR>leave, the president was shot in an &quot;attempted coup&quot;. The mercenaries<BR>cooked up an implausible story, but local people placed the blame<BR>firmly at the feet of their now-hated foreign interlopers. A French<BR>navy flotilla was sent in from nearby Mayotte (the fourth Comoro<BR>island, which elected to stay French) and Denard and his men left<BR>their fiefdom in a South African army plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I first met him two years into his forced exile. He limped into a<BR>fashionable Johannesburg Japanese restaurant, conservatively dressed<BR>and looking for all the world like a diplomat or captain of industry<BR>-- a far cry from the young Bordelais peasant boy who had lied his<BR>way into the French navy. It was only when he lowered his heavysense the force of his personality.<BR>framed spectacles to reveal piercing turquoise eyes that I could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the fact he knew I had spent the previous months on the<BR>islands researching the events surrounding Abdallah's &quot;mysterious<BR>death&quot;, he insisted that his verdict of accidental death was the<BR>correct one. He honestly believed he could convince me, purely<BR>through personal charm and power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His house in Pretoria was comfortable, but in no way ostentatious,<BR>and he always acted with perfect propriety. It soon became clear,<BR>however, that he was desperate to return to France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He did so on February 1 1993, to stand trial for Benin. In what<BR>was undoubtedly a pre-arranged deal -- and basking in the praise of<BR>assorted generals -- Denard received his five-year suspended sentence<BR>and went to live in Bordeaux, near several of his seven wives (only<BR>one divorced).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He founded a security company. The introduction letter he sent to<BR>prospective clients began: &quot;When a man's name merges with history it<BR>naturally leaves an echo in his contemporaries' mind ...&quot; Clearly<BR>&quot;the legend's&quot; self-belief had not dimmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, the audacity of his latest coup is astounding. Either he is<BR>severely deluded, or has decided to die on his beloved &quot;perfume<BR>isles&quot; -- probably a bit of both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the best efforts of conspiracy theorists, it is most<BR>likely that the funding for the coup came from Comorian opposition<BR>politicians -- not from South Africa or France as has been suggested.<BR>For France signed an agreement underwriting the security of the<BR>Comoros, a deal it is now honouring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Paris won't want Denard. He still has stories to tell, of his<BR>days as a quasi-secret service operative. It was to silence these<BR>tales that the suspended sentence deal was struck. The Comoros cannot<BR>survive in an international vacuum -- they rely heavily on foreign<BR>aid -- and what other African country will offer Denard sanctuary?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My guess is that Denard, 66, has waged his last campaign, closing<BR>for good the chapter of major mercenary intervention in Africa. But<BR>that has been said before -- and the phoenix is still there and<BR>flapping his wings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>October 6, 1995<BR>by Eddie Koch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - The suntanned tourists who arrived back at<BR>Johannesburg International Airport on Saturday, airlifted out of a<BR>Comoros holiday extended courtesy of Colonel Bob Denard and his band<BR>of embattled mercenaries, highlighted a central theme of Pretoria's<BR>relations with the troubled archipelago. Many of them told<BR>television reporters how they sipped cocktails on the beach without<BR>realising people were being shot in a mini-war 20km away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While South African tourists and businessmen treat the place as a<BR>playground for pleasure, they are reluctant to recognise -- either<BR>through naivete or a hedonistic urge not to have their fun spoilt --<BR>that wretched economic conditions combined with byzantine political<BR>infighting have turned the stormy islands into what one recent<BR>account calls cloud coup-coup land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the Comoros suffer from chronic economic and political<BR>instability was shown in Denard's latest attempt to install a shadow<BR>government that would allow his force of mercenaries to rule in the<BR>island's background. After toppling the government of President Sa-d<BR>Mohamed Djohar last Thursday, Denard tried to avert French military<BR>intervention by rapidly handing nominal power over to an interim<BR>government led by a trio of civilian leaders -- Sa-d Ali Kemal,<BR>Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim and Omar Tamou.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, within 24-hours of being appointed, the new government<BR>disintegrated as the three co-presidents squabbled over whether<BR>Denard be allowed to stay on as a citizen of the Comoros. Kemal and<BR>Abdoulkarim said they wanted him, while Tamou, secretary general of<BR>the powerful Udzima party, insisted Denard and the other mercenaries<BR>should get out and let Comorians decide their own future. The result?<BR>A meeting of political parties, called to cement Denard's new<BR>civilian government, dispersed in comic chaos -- and opened the way<BR>for this week's invasion by French special forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A crack commando of 600 French troops ended the dramatic week by<BR>storming the island on Wednesday morning. By early yesterday,<BR>Africa's most famous mercenary had released the president and holed<BR>up in a makeshift barracks, trying to negotiate an &quot;honourable&quot;<BR>surrender for his men. The French commanders insisted, however, they<BR>were not there to do a deal with Denard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If South Africans are naive about the stormy politics of the<BR>Comoros, Denard should at least have had the foresight to realise<BR>that the internecine nature of the island's ruling elites would undo<BR>his latest effort to become king. In an interview with author<BR>Samantha Weinberg -- conducted after he was exiled to Pretoria in the<BR>wake of the 1992 assassination of Comorian President Ahmed Abdallah<BR>-- the Frenchman justified his series of armed incursions by saying<BR>the staunchly Islamic islands have always had more mercenaries and<BR>putsches than priests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The self-imposed truth of his statement shows in a brief<BR>chronology of coups that have rocked the islands over the last two<BR>decades:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * August 1975. President Ahmed Abdallah is deposed in a coup<BR>after winning the country's first elections three years earlier.<BR>Denard's mercenaries install a young populist leader called Ali<BR>Soilih as president. Denard leaves the islands for three years to<BR>embark on other African adventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * May 1978. Denard and a 30-strong commando overthrow Soilih --<BR>who, in the intervening years, imposed a rigid form of socialism on<BR>the islands and tried to smash their traditional Islamic strucuture.<BR>They restore Abdallah to power and Denard effectively rules the<BR>islands by turning his dogs of war into a Garde Presidentielle that<BR>becomes the military, and economic, power behind the throne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * March 1985. Comorian members of the Presidential Guard stage a<BR>mutiny against their white mercenary commanders. The presence of the<BR>mercenaries -- and accusations that they were plundering the<BR>island's coffers -- leads to another bungled coup attempt in November<BR>1987. Both uprisings are brutally supressed on Denard's orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * November 1989. President Abdallah is shot dead during a heated<BR>argument with Denard and a mercenary colleague called Commandant<BR>Marques, after the president comes under strong pressure from France<BR>and South Africa, now led by reformist President FW De Klerk, to get<BR>rid of the mercenaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Denard is widely believed to be the assassin, but claims the<BR>president was accidentally shot by one of his own aides -- who was<BR>panicking because the Comoros armed forces were busy staging a coup<BR>of their own! The murder, still unresolved, leads to Denard being<BR>forced into exile. Djohar is elected as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who believed that the departure of the modern-day pirates<BR>would bring stability to the Comoros were soon to be disappointed.<BR>Djohar almost immediately reverted to the traditional style of ruling<BR>the islands through a complicated system of patronage which revolved<BR>around constantly shifting alliances with the Islamic sultans and<BR>ruling families who control the archipelago and much of its ailing<BR>economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since coming to power in 1989, Djohar's government has been<BR>constantly plagued by allegations that members of his family have<BR>their fingers in the state's coffers while civil servants and<BR>civilians have to endure one of the world's poorest economies. The<BR>islands have a tiny manufacturing sector based on the export of<BR>vanilla, cloves and a plant called ylang ylang, which is used to make<BR>French perfume. But 80 percent of the islanders are employed in<BR>subsistence farming or stagnating cash crop estates and, on top of<BR>that, an austerity programme designed by the International Monetary<BR>Fund and France has caused serious distress for most Comorians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These tensions came to a head in the months leading up to Denard's<BR>latest coup last week -- and provided the French mercenary with the<BR>pretext he needed to stage what now looks to be his last adventure<BR>in Africa. In July, a crisis was sparked in Djohar's cabinet by<BR>allegations that a deal involving the proposed privatisation of Air<BR>Comores and its merger with a company based in the United Arab<BR>Emirates was riddled with corruption. The president responded by<BR>sacking three of his strongest critics from the cabinet and replacing<BR>them with loyalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was preceded by an expose, published in the Indian Ocean<BR>newsletter in May this year, that Djohar's government had signed a<BR>deal with German and Austrian companies to build a dump for<BR>processing toxic waste from industrial countries.  And, to make<BR>matters worse, Comorians were treated to the spectacle of Djohar's<BR>two sons-in-law squabbling with each other over control of the toxic<BR>waste and airline deals: Mohamed Sa-d Mchangama versus Mohamed Sa-d<BR>Sagaf versus Mohamed Sa-d Djohar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While these fratricidal struggles were undermining the government,<BR>Prime Minister Mohamed Caabi el Yachroutu warned of impending<BR>economic disaster. In a June speech to parliament, he pointed out<BR>that state revenue in the first five months of 1995 had fallen short<BR>of budget forecasts and that $3,2- million had to be saved by the end<BR>of the year. Salaries of government ministers and civil servants were<BR>slashed and massive tax levies imposed on all government and<BR>parastatal workers -- by far the largest segment of the formal labour<BR>force in an archipelago wracked by unemployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not surprisingly, Denard's latest coup was preceded by strikes and<BR>demonstrations in the streets of the island's capital, Moroni, and<BR>followed by reports that a large percentage of the population danced<BR>with jubilation in the same streets when the mercenary force landed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> France's airborne invasion of the stormy isles this week will, no<BR>doubt, be followed by the rapid reinstatement of Djohar and his prime<BR>minister. France will continue to provide a lifeline in the form of<BR>$17-million each year in development aid. And tourists will soon be<BR>able to visit Le Galawa again and return with tales about their<BR>idyllic holiday in cloud coup-coup land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the options for France's dog of war have narrowed<BR>dramatically. It looks as though his prediction, made to reporters in<BR>Moroni this week, that he will spend many of his remaining years in a<BR>French jail, will come true. When French troops last chased Denard<BR>out the Comoros, in 1989, the colonel was able to ensure that he and<BR>his men were flown in a South African Air Force Dakota to Pretoria,<BR>where Denard lived in a house supplied by the South African<BR>government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The favours from Pretoria were designed to buy his silence. When<BR>Denard ruled the islands in the 1980s, he allowed South Africa's<BR>military intelligence to build a listening post to monitor strategic<BR>naval traffic and the ANC's training camps in nearby Tanzania.<BR>Weapons from South Africa were smuggled to right-wing Renamo rebels<BR>from the Comoros and there are reports that the islands were used as<BR>a refuelling point for South African cargo planes ferrying arms from<BR>Armscor to Iraq before the Gulf War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there is now a new government in South Africa and the French<BR>are clearly weary of the colonel's antics. French military officers<BR>pointed out this week that Denard was under a five-year suspended<BR>sentence for his role in the 1977 Benin coup and, this time, he has<BR>little chance of staying out of jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of this offers little hope for an end to the persistent state<BR>of political crisis which periodically punctures -- as it did in the<BR>last fortnight -- the South African romance that the Comoros are a<BR>place of perfume and happiness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>October 6, 1995<BR>by Hazel Friedman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - Two-thirds of South Africa's black population are<BR>subject to poor health conditions. This is among the startling<BR>findings of South Africa's first national household health survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 200-page report, released by the Community Agency for Social<BR>Enquiry (Case) on behalf of the Kaiser Foundation this week,<BR>sketches an appalling picture of continued racial imbalance in the<BR>conditions that make for healthy living. The list goes on: 80<BR>percent of African households have no tap indoors, 16 percent have<BR>no toilet of any kind and nearly 60 percent are without electricity,<BR>while 67 percent live below the poverty line.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report, based on the scientific sampling of 4 000 households<BR>across the country, concludes that black South Africans,<BR>particularly those from rural areas, are worse off in every aspect<BR>of their lives compared to other segments of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This inevitably makes them more prone to ill health and povertyaccess to health services, because of the cost of health care and<BR>related diseases. Yet they have the greatest difficulty in getting<BR>excessive distances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The principal victims of this imbalance are African children<BR>under the age of five, of which 75 percent live in rural ares. Of<BR>these, 76 percent live in households with incomes below the poverty<BR>line, and 23 percent of families are too poor to properly feed<BR>their pre-school children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the survey's prognosis for health care in South Africa is not<BR>entirely bleak. Divided into three components, it presents health<BR>reforms in an historical context, describes the critical elements<BR>needed to transform health care in South Africa, and offers a<BR>research and implementation agenda geared towards shifting the<BR>emphasis of health care from a curative approach towards a primary<BR>health care system based on the principle of equal health care for<BR>all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The obvious conclusion is that the government's primary school<BR>feeding programme is not reaching a substantial number of chidren<BR>from rural households living below the minimum level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &gt;From the start of this mammoth undertaking in June 1994,<BR>research was hampered by a lack of demographic data and by the fact<BR>that over 65% of African births are unregistered, throwing the<BR>accuracy of any research into health-related issues seriously into<BR>qestion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite these problems, the survey has succeeded in providing a<BR>barometer for measuring the impact of improvements in health and<BR>health services for South Africans in the future. It also gives a<BR>comprehensive analysis of policy developments in the health sector<BR>and attempts to formulate a research agenda towards addressing and<BR>clarifying unclear policy issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>October 6, 1995<BR>by Simon Segal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - Encouraged by declines in the inflation rate and<BR>money supply growth, economists are increasingly changing their<BR>forecasts and talking about the next movement in the Reserve Bank's<BR>(RB) interest rates being down rather than up. This will herald a<BR>decline in the prime and bond rates for the first time since<BR>November 1993. Any action, however, is only likely well into next<BR>year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until recently the consensus among economists was that the RB's<BR>rates had further to rise. Some were expecting that prime rate, now<BR>18,5 percent would exceed 20 percent by year-end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bond market too is indicating a rate fall -- rates on the<BR>long-end (maturing in 10 years' time) dropped to around 15 percent<BR>this week, their lowest level in over a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such optimism is fuelled by August money supply figures and<BR>September's inflation rate. Government is also ahead in its funding<BR>targets for this fiscal year which means government supply of paper<BR>is short of institutional demand, hence pressure on bond prices to<BR>rise and rates to fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rate of increase in M3 money supply slowed to 14,84 percent<BR>compared to 15,82 percent the previous month. The inflation rate<BR>dropped to 7,5 percent compared to July's nine percent. An<BR>inflation rate falling to five percent, mentioned by RB Governor<BR>Chris Stals, now does not appear such a starry-eyed idea. Most<BR>economists are still, however, looking at inflation averaging nine<BR>to10 percent this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An inflation rate of 7,5 percent and a prime rate of 18,5 percent<BR>leaves the real (inflation adjusted) prime rate at 11 percent. Many<BR>economists are critical that this is too high compared to most<BR>economies and especially punitive when South Africa's development<BR>and growth needs are taken into account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Real short-term money market rates are 6,95 percent in South<BR>Africa, compared to 2,6 percent in Malaysia, 22 percent in Brazil,<BR>and a negative 4,55 percent in Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From this sample of developing economies' real interest rates,<BR>one can take a pick to suit an argument. The RB, however, will<BR>remain cautious about relaxing its monetary policy too soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Firstly, the deficit on the current account of the balance of<BR>payments is running at some R1-billion a month.  So far this is<BR>being more than offset by net capital inflows, hence the improvement<BR>in the RB's reserves from R7,8-billion in August 1994 to R11,9and unpredictable. At R11,9-billion, South Africa's reserves are<BR>billion in August 1995. But short-term capital inflows are volatile<BR>still only worth 1,3 months' worth of imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, with growing social and political pressures to deliver<BR>more on reconstruction and development there are still doubts about<BR>government's commitment to fiscal restraint. The deficit before<BR>borrowing is still five to six percent of the gross domestic product<BR>(GDP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most economists agree that monetary policy still has to be<BR>tighter than it would otherwise need to be were fiscal policy<BR>tighter -- whether rates have to be as high is disputed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thirdly, there is a danger that the declining inflation and money<BR>supply figures are statistically deceptive as they are off high<BR>bases.  When they come off lower bases, as they will be next year<BR>after the present declines, further drops become increasingly<BR>difficult.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>October 6, 1995<BR>by Justin Pearce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG - Could South Africa have its own version of the OJ<BR>Simpson trial? The tensions that shifted the focus of the Simpson<BR>case from murder to racism are equally present in South Africa. And<BR>like the United States, South Africa has a justice system where much<BR>depends on the quality and credibility of evidence, and the relative<BR>skill of prosecution and defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several South African lawyers have noted that the justice system<BR>here is no better able than its American counterpart to accommodate<BR>the racial tensions that pervade both societies. One lawyer pointed<BR>out in an interview this week that the only thing that stops South<BR>African trials from turning into racial flashpoints was the fact that<BR>in this country, court proceedings do not receive the same level of<BR>media attention as the Simpson trial.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In South Africa, sub judice legislation outlaws the kind of<BR>rampant speculation that took place around the Simpson case, and the<BR>idea of an accused publishing a book to profess his innocence while<BR>the trial is in progress -- as Simpson did -- is out of the question.<BR>It is highly unlikely that South Africa's largely conservative<BR>judiciary will condone the presence of television cameras in<BR>courtrooms in the forseeable future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The relevance of the Simpson trial to South Africa has been noted<BR>by South Africa's Black Lawyers' Association (BLA), which welcomed<BR>the Simpson verdict as &quot;a very strong signal to racist police<BR>officers that decent ordinary human beings will not rely on the<BR>evidence of such people to convict others&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The BLA statement echoes the line of argument adopted by Simpson's<BR>defendants, who rather than contesting the forensic evidence against<BR>Simpson, focused on the contention that the prosecution's evidence<BR>was racially tainted. The revelation of police racism struck chords<BR>with America's black community, and caused public opinion about the<BR>Simpson case to be split along racial lines: according to polls, 80<BR>percent of black Americans were convinced of Simpson's innocence, and<BR>a similar proportion of whites believed him to be guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In South Africa, race was invoked by supporters of Winnie Mandela<BR>during her trial on kidnapping charges in 1991. A key theme in<BR>Mandela's defence was the accusation that the minister from whose<BR>home the kidnap victims had been removed had been sexually abusing<BR>the boys -- and Mandela's supporters responded with placards reading<BR>&quot;homosexuality is not in black culture&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Racial polarisation was more obvious in Zimbabwe, during the trial<BR>of anaethetist Dr Richard McGown, who was charged with causing the<BR>deaths of black patients through negligence. The trial prompted angry<BR>protests outside the court by demonstrators who saw the deaths as<BR>tantamount to genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such cases are likely to become more common in South Africa unless<BR>urgent steps are taken to change the situation whereby the majority<BR>of trials involve a white judge passing sentence on a black accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The BLA said the result of the Simpson trial demonstrated that<BR>South African justice would be well served by the reintroduction of<BR>juries to redress the racial imbalances in the administration of<BR>justice. But Etienne Mureinik, professor of law at the University of<BR>the Witwatersrand, said a jury system was not ideal. In South Africa,<BR>the jury system was phased out in the 1960s, and while it was still<BR>in place jurors were invariably white. The introduction of a nonas a possible means of making the justice system more accesible. The<BR>racial jury system for South Africa was discussed in the early 1990s<BR>idea lost favour, however, owing to the often arbitrary nature of<BR>jury decisions, and the fact that a representative South African jury<BR>could well be hampered by the lack of a common language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather than reintroduce juries, the Justice Department has since<BR>last year's elections made a concerted effort to increase the number<BR>of black and woman judges on South African benches. However, it is<BR>clear that there are not yet enough suitably qualified black lawyers<BR>to enable the benches to become fully representative of South African<BR>society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while in Simpson's case police racism may have ended up<BR>playing into the hands of the defence, in many cases the judicial<BR>system is not sufficient to bring police malpractice to light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University of the Western Cape senior law lecturer Pierre de Vos<BR>points out that Simpson's acquittal had a lot to do with the skill of<BR>his top defence lawyers, without whom the bungling of the Los Angeles<BR>police might have gone unnoticed. Both in the United States and in<BR>South Africa, black accused are likely to be reliant on pro deo<BR>lawyers. A study conducted by the University of Cape Town before the<BR>abolition of the death penalty showed that accused who could not<BR>afford their own defence were more likely to be convicted, and more<BR>likely to be sentenced to death, than accused who had engaged the<BR>services of a defence lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The police make mistakes,&quot; De Vos remarked, &quot;but usually they<BR>don't get caught.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And while the police may have been damned by their own racism,<BR>Simpson's acquittal in the face of compelling forensic evidence<BR>points to a prosecution which was left lagging behind by a brilliant<BR>defence. This too has sobering lessons for South Africa, where the<BR>prosecution system is struggling. As state expenditure is cut back,<BR>prosecution will become an even less promising career option for a<BR>law graduate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The role of the prosecutor is equally crucial in South Africa and<BR>the United States: in both countries, a judge is an arbitrator who<BR>weighs up the merits of the opposing arguments -- which allows the<BR>emphasis of a trial to shift towards an assessment of the validity of<BR>evidence. De Vos contrasted this to the system used in continental<BR>Europe, where judges have greater powers to investigate the case as<BR>they see fit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One South African judge, welcoming the Simpson judgment as &quot;a<BR>triumph of anti-racism&quot;, expressed frustration at the inadequacy of<BR>the material which judges have to work with: &quot;The lesson is that a<BR>new situation needs new methods of investigation -- methods that are<BR>lacking even in a technologically advanced society such as the United<BR>States.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - Some depositors of Africa Commercial Bank are said to be<BR>doing all they can to save the bank from collapsing through<BR>additional deposits and provision of capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The outstanding thing about ACB is its goodwill. Over ten years,<BR>management has made a good investment in customer relations and this<BR>might save it because there are suggestions that the shareholding be<BR>distributed so that the public can buy shares and the bank would then<BR>be recapitalised,&quot; said a Bank of Zambia (BOZ) source in an interview<BR>last Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Post Newspapers accounts and administration manager Patrick<BR>Musengwa added: &quot;The bank tried its best for its customers under very<BR>difficult circumstances and does deserve their compassion.

But depositors have the difficult<BR>task of trying to balance their desire to save the bank and risking<BR>their funds in the event of the bank's total failure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to an ACB source, a number of companies are supporting<BR>the bank by increasing deposits and taking up shares.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - Musa Siame's financially troubled Mutende Investments has<BR>opted for voluntary liquidation to escape 'harassment' by<BR>increasingly uncompromising creditors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group, which has been built and maintained by borrowings for<BR>many years, has been failing to meet its obligations with many<BR>creditors. Records at the Registrar of Companies have confirmed<BR>Mutende Investments' voluntary liquidation intentions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An extract of a special resolution passed by members of Mutende<BR>Investments Limited reads in part: &quot;That it has been proved to the<BR>satisfaction of this meeting that the company cannot by reason of its<BR>liability continue business, and that it is advisable to wind up the<BR>same and accordingly, that the company be wound up voluntarily.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But some creditors have asked the courts to stop the voluntary<BR>liquidation which they feel is nothing but a scheme to enable Mutende<BR>Group of companies escape liabilities and loss of all assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leading the opposition to this voluntary liquidation is the<BR>Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ). The bank had advanced Mutende US $1<BR>million five years ago. And with the accelerated rise in interest<BR>rates, the balance is now into billions of kwacha. DBZ has applied to<BR>the High Court in Lusaka to stop the voluntary liquidation, claiming<BR>that &quot;the special resolution is not in good faith as Mutende<BR>Investments Limited is the holding company of more than 12 companies,<BR>which themselves are still in business&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That the special resolution is aimed at evading debt to DBZ which<BR>Mutende Investments Limited can easily, through itself and<BR>subsidiaries, discharge. That Mutende Investments discharge forthwith<BR>its debt to DBZ,&quot; read part of DBZ's application. And Mutende's<BR>problems have also been compounded by the coming together of all its<BR>creditors to form a united front for the recovery of their monies.<BR>This Mutende Creditors Committee has appointed Rodgers Sombe to<BR>represent their common interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Sombe disclosed in an interview last week that Mutende<BR>Investments owes over K8 billion to his clients. The debts of the<BR>Mutende Group of companies with Africa Commercial Bank were claimed<BR>by some financial analysts as a contributing factor to the bank's<BR>liquidity problems. Mutende is reported to owe ACB, a bank in which<BR>Siame has an interest, more than K2.4 billion (US $2.4 million).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - Donors have complained of corruption and abuse of office<BR>in the conduct of the affairs of ZCCM, and have warned that before<BR>the mines company can be privatised the corruption will have to be<BR>stamped out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The donors expressed their concerns about the running of Zambia<BR>Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) at a consultative meeting with<BR>officials of the Zambian government held in Lusaka's Mulungushi<BR>Conference Centre a fortnight ago. Both diplomatic and Zambian<BR>government sources have confirmed that at the meeting British High<BR>Commissioner to Zambia Patrick Nixon showed great concern about the<BR>corrupt manner in which the affairs of the predominantly state-owned<BR>mining conglomerate ZCCM were being conducted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The explanations by the company's chief executive, Edward<BR>Shamutete, were said to have been rejected by the donors in<BR>attendance as unsatisfactory. &quot;I can confirm that the British High<BR>Commissioner, Patrick Nixon, did express concern about the<BR>performance and management of ZCCM. This was said in a private<BR>meeting,&quot; said the High Commission's second secretary Russ Dixon in<BR>reply to a Post press query on Monday, adding: &quot;And we do not wish to<BR>comment any further on this matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Zambian government official said the High Commissioner did not<BR>mince his words on the subject of corruption. &quot;There were strong<BR>words on corruption and abuse of office from the British High<BR>Commissioner which were supported by most donor countries,&quot; a cabinet<BR>source said in an interview a fortnight ago. &quot;It seems donors are now<BR>getting on to this very strongly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Shamutete declined to discuss the donor's ZCCM corruption<BR>concerns. &quot;The chief executive has a right to refuse to be<BR>interviewed,&quot; said ZCCM spokesman Francis Musonda. The donors are<BR>said to have raised questions about the apparent corrupt manner in<BR>which some ZCCM subsidiaries and other assets are being cornered<BR>without following the laid down privatisation procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Corruption too must be stamped out and we pointed to the way<BR>Techpro Procurement and IPX in Johannesburg were closed as being<BR>unacceptable,&quot; a diplomat said in an interview last week. &quot;We told<BR>them if ZCCM has to be privatised it must begin to operate<BR>efficiently, like the Chilean mines.&quot; The consultative meeting is<BR>said to have been attended by 25 officials from Zambian economic<BR>units which included Minister of Finance Ronald Penza, commerce<BR>minister Dipak Patel, deputy ministers Dan Pule and Mathias Mphande,<BR>Bank of Zambia officials, ZCCM chief executive Shamutete, Valentine<BR>Chitalu of the Zambia Privatisation Agency and some permanent<BR>secretaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The donor countries in attendance were the United Kingdom, the<BR>United States of America, the Federal Republic of Germany, the<BR>Scandinavian countries and Saudi Arabia. And a source who attended<BR>the meeting said Penza took most of the flack. &quot;Most donors took it<BR>out on Penza who was visibly annoyed about it but they told him that<BR>he is a senior minister of this government and there is no-one else<BR>they can talk to,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The donor countries had a common stand on the matter, they told<BR>the government they would like to see some consistency in the running<BR>of ZCCM and other institutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - A Lusaka magistrate heard on Wednesday that the state was<BR>intimidating Post journalists charged with criminally defaming<BR>presidential press aide Richard Sakala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defence lawyer Sakwiba Sikota told Lusaka principal magistrate<BR>Meebelo Kalima that on several occassions the court together with the<BR>accussed have been subjected to intimidation when the complainant has<BR>used State House stationary and letter heads in communications on<BR>matters concerning the case. Sikota was replying to an application by<BR>the prosecutor Katonga who wanted the court to rule on what he called<BR>The Post's unfair coverage of the proceedings during the continued<BR>trial of Post managing director and editor-in-chief Fred M'membe,<BR>managing editor Bright Mwape, news editor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goliath Mungonge and Chronicle reporter Nkonkomalimba Kafunda.<BR>&quot;There has been quite some intimidation coming from the state over<BR>this case. We have tried to ignore the state manipulation which is<BR>definitely orchestrated in an extremely shrewd manner,&quot;=A0he told the<BR>court. He made specific reference to a de facto order which Sakala<BR>made last Saturday on State House letterheaded paper that the trial<BR>&quot;should only commence at 11:00 hours instead of the scheduled 09:30<BR>hours because he had a presidential engagement&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These actions have made it clear that the complainant is a<BR>superior one who should be accorded facilities different from others<BR>together with special attention, &quot; Sikota stated. Sikota also<BR>revealed that he had suffered monetary losses arising from the<BR>specialness of the witness and because of what he called a constant<BR>barrage of belly aching complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kalima refused to grant an adjournment to the prosecution so that<BR>they could reply to Sikota's submission saying &quot;let us not be drawn<BR>into potracted replies and delays, &quot; and set the ruling for October<BR>25, 1995. He however admitted that it would need &quot;a lot of work and a<BR>sober mind&quot; before a ruling could be made considering a number of<BR>important issues that were raised by the prosecution and defence. It<BR>was the 24th adjournament of the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - The Human Rights Committee of the Law Association of<BR>Zambia (LAZ) has deplored recent attacks by civic education advocate<BR>Lucy Sichone on the integrity of judges calling it a ploy calculated<BR>to mislead the public on the role of judg-es in the administration of<BR>justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chairman of the committee Willie Mubanga said in a statement from<BR>Ndola that the judiciary can only effectively discharge its duties of<BR>dispensing justice if it is not subjected to ridicule, public odium<BR>or disrespect.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The judiciary as the final arbiter in criminal and<BR>civil disputes cannot publicly defend itself from such attacks. This<BR>is also reco-gnised by the United Nations which has established<BR>Special Rapporteur on the independence of the judiciary so as to<BR>preserve the judicial independence and to protect judges,&quot;=A0Mubanga<BR>said in a press statement last week. Sichone had last month advised<BR>judges whose rulings are found to be questionable to quit so that the<BR>bench could maintain its role as the last line of defence for<BR>citizens' human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What we need are men and women of integrity who will resign on<BR>their own if their judgments are questioned substantially. So<BR>basically we are talking about the integrity of the people on the<BR>bench,&quot; Sichone said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - Calls by legal affairs minister Remmy Mushota to have<BR>criminal proceedings instituted against former president Kenneth<BR>Kaunda have been described as an act of vengeance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting to Mushota's statements in an interview on Tuesday, human<BR>rights lawyer Roger Chongwe charged that Mushota was not a lawyer but<BR>a politician who likes &quot;throwing his weight around.&quot; Mushota said in<BR>a press release last Sunday that: &quot;We have evidence that Dr Kaunda<BR>only renounced his Malawian citizenship on June 19, 1970. Since we<BR>have discovered that he is not a Zambian but he entered high office,<BR>he is liable for prosecution.&quot; But Chongwe said: &quot;Mus- hota is just a<BR>vengeful fellow and a bad lawyer. Lawyers are supposed to be<BR>impartial and not take sides the way Mushota is disgracefully doing.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chongwe's sentiments were echoed by Foundation for Democratic<BR>Process (FODEP) secretary and Church of God overseer John Mambo who<BR>called the intended charges petty in an interview in Lusaka on<BR>Tuesday. &quot;Kaunda was president of this country for a long time. It<BR>does not make sense to come up today and start accusing him of being<BR>Malawian because this is setting a bad tradition of witch hunting, &quot;<BR>Mambo said. Mambo, who appreciated the fact that he had once been<BR>victimised by Kaunda when he was branded Mozambican in 1990, asked<BR>Mushota to be reasonable and not personalise things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Imagine what kind of a country this will be if everyone who<BR>assumed power declared some people alien?&quot; Mambo asked. And Labour<BR>Party secretary general and former commissioner on the Constitutional<BR>Review Commission, Azwell Banda, said it was sad that a whole<BR>government seemed to be bent on destroying one man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I see a dangerous trend developing in the doubts being cast on<BR>Kaunda's citizenship. This can give rise to forms of &quot;ethnic<BR>cleansing&quot; which will create divisions in this country. If the<BR>constitution fails to protect Kaunda, it gives him leave to take any<BR>measures he will so decide to protect himself,&quot; Banda warned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)<BR>October 6, 1995<BR>by Carolyn Mwanza</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - Two events have generated a lot of debate over the past<BR>two weeks. The first is the publication of the government white paper<BR>on the Mwanakatwe Constitutional Review Commission released by<BR>information minister Amusa Mwanamwambwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most significant in the white paper are the government rejections.<BR>Just to avoid the referendum the government has deliberately turned<BR>back the clock to more than fifty years ago and thrown out all<BR>advances in human rights and the concept of social conscience made by<BR>the international community. When the cabinet objected to Rodger<BR>Chongwe's proposal that a small technical committee should study<BR>constitutional proposals to the Mvunga commission and work out<BR>suggestions for inclusion, the reason it gave was that a commission<BR>of inquiry would be better placed to provide a comprehensive report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several billions of kwacha of taxpayer's money, time and effort<BR>are wasted when President Chiluba and his cabinet reject the report<BR>and tell Zambians there is nothing wrong with the 1991 constitution<BR>after all. The government was just giving some people jobs to tour<BR>the country obtaining views it had no intention to listen to because<BR>all it wanted was to change clauses relating to presidential<BR>candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Debate on the constitution was stopped by the President until, we<BR>were told, the government reaction to the Commission be published in<BR>a white paper. The waiting has ended and the nation is left with the<BR>government's rejections of the public view. The government is willing<BR>to allow debate not of the constitution but of its reaction. To show<BR>how democratic the government is both minister of legal affairs Remmy<BR>Mushota and President Chiluba opened the debate by defending their<BR>own reaction in the white paper. This is what brings out the second<BR>event of the week - they released documents which showed that Kenneth<BR>Kaunda was a foreigner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Luminzu Shimaponda, later echoed by Mushota, the<BR>documents later released to the press revealed that Kaunda ruled this<BR>country for six years as a foreigner before he finally renounced his<BR>Malawian citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What the government propaganda machine does not tell Zambians is<BR>that the 1964 constitution gave citizenship to all British protected<BR>persons who were in Northern Rhodesia on October 24, 1964 and<BR>secondly that the 1964 constitution did allow for dual citizenship<BR>and this situation did not change until 1969-70. The Zambian economy<BR>at independence was dominated by whites. In 1968 the UNIP government<BR>introduced economic reforms which attempted to give to black Zambians<BR>the economic muscle. The Industrial Development Corporation (INDECO)<BR>expanded its activities to acquiring companies and developing others.<BR>What we take for granted today - in the form of trained manpower or<BR>investment in parastatals - were all developed by the government<BR>during this period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lest we forget at independence the only business Zambians dealt in<BR>was tearooms and market stalls. No one today, not even President<BR>Chiluba, can ignore the fact that Zambia is what it is today because<BR>of what UNIP under Kaunda did for this country. There is no doubt<BR>that the men and women who won independence for Zambia had a vision<BR>and a commitment to develop this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not meant to be an apology for any mistakes they may have<BR>made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But these are heavily outweighed by their commitment to making<BR>Zambia a country which was proud of itself. Turning back to the<BR>constitution, in about 1970 the UNIP government under Kaunda<BR>introduced an amendment to the Zambian constitution which in effect<BR>removed dual citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many Zambians of all colours who had any links with another<BR>country through parentage or birth had to choose to be Zambian or not<BR>to be Zambian. It is in this context that Kaunda renounced his<BR>Malawian citizenship and in doing so he was merely expressing his<BR>commitment to Zambia, the country he had founded with many other<BR>compatriots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would be sad if 1995 politicians with no respect for history or<BR>appreciation of what Zambia has achieved as a nation used all means,<BR>including deliberate distortions and falsehoods, to hound a man who<BR>has given so much to the country of his birth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - The world economy is growing. Increased trade resulting<BR>from increasingly integrated economies is driving this growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No country is immune from this integration and no country can<BR>avoid it for long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Look at the price of maize to see this link. A government's effort<BR>to hold the domestic maize price below world levels results in<BR>reduced plantings and reduced production domestically, and even<BR>higher prices or larger subsides in following years. You can't beat<BR>the market. But while a nation cannot avoid integration into the<BR>world's economy, the benefits of integration are not automatic. The<BR>output of an economy results from the application of scarce<BR>resources, what economists call the factors of production: land,<BR>labour and capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A nation's land and labour resources are largely God-given. It is<BR>the application of capital-investment, which makes land and labour<BR>productive.Capital is scarce, and every nation's self-generated<BR>supply is limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Capital seeks a return and avoids risks. The integration of the<BR>world economy means all nations now compete for the same pool of<BR>capital. Those nations successful in attracting capital - including<BR>that of their own citizens - will prosper. The unsuccessful will<BR>flounder. So what can a nation do to attract this capital? Getting<BR>the macro-economic picture right is essential. Inflation and currency<BR>depreciation are the nemesis of capital. While the economist may<BR>suggest that a little is good for the economy, the businessman knows<BR>'enough is too enough.' Successfully managing an economy is no easy<BR>task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A balanced budget, control of expenditures, adequate tax receipts<BR>and provision of adequate and appropriate government services are all<BR>essential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meeting these often conflicting goals requires the making of<BR>choices, the setting of priorities where everything can not be the<BR>highest priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The macro-economic picture is never complete. It is always<BR>becoming. It can only be heading in the right direction. Capital,<BR>avoiding risks, responds to direction and consistency. Slippages,<BR>particularly those that could be foreseen and were preventable are<BR>anathema to capital flows. While there may be debate on how much<BR>government involvement in the economy is needed, there is a<BR>requirement that government provide a regulatory environment for the<BR>conduct of business and investment. Customs, taxes, environmental<BR>laws,transport and many other areas require government involvement to<BR>establish a predictable framework and climate for business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For investors, the questions include: How does this investment<BR>climate compare with that of alternate investment locations? Is it<BR>transparent?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is it conducted on the basis of clear laws, rules and regulations?<BR>How much bureaucratic and political discretion is available? Is it a<BR>level playing field? The rule of law is essential to attract<BR>sufficient capital to produce growth and development. The rule of law<BR>demands fair, effective and consistence enforcement of law, rules and<BR>regulations. Airlines cannot compete when the rules are waived for<BR>one but not the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manufacturers cannot compete when duty is charged to one but not<BR>the other. Traders will not trade if the deep pockets of the<BR>government are available to one but not the other. And investors will<BR>not invest if the tax rules are changed in midstream.Perhaps the most<BR>vexing question and unquantifiable risk facing the investor is that<BR>associated with governance, the political system, the political risk.<BR>The most basic requirement of a democratic system is to provide free<BR>and fair elections in which all eligible citizens can vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the investor, elections must be seen as free and fair so that<BR>the government has the legitimacy and popular support necessary to<BR>govern effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since political risk cannot be directly measured, indirect<BR>indicators become critical factors in investment decisions.<BR>Suggestions that basic constitutional issues are being used to<BR>manipulate today's partisan political agenda raise concerns. If<BR>government can manipulate the constitution then government can<BR>manipulate the law to pillage an investment. Investors will look at<BR>such countries as poor risks for business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa has too many examples of countries with rich potential for<BR>private investment, job creation and economic development, where<BR>government practices scare off serious investors, leaving the field<BR>to con-artists, money launderers and other criminals who always seem<BR>able to make a fast buck on the backs of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much as media resposibility often appears lacking, the investor<BR>knows a country stands to lose more if media freedoms are eroded.<BR>And, excessive concern and efforts to restrict media freedoms will be<BR>perceived as a basic lack of trust by government in the fairness and<BR>objectivity of its people. Another key political issue for any<BR>investor is the role and actions of leaders themselves. Positions in<BR>government must be seen as service to the nation, not as a key to<BR>personal enrichment. Government needs the support of its people ever<BR>more so when it asks them for sacrifice. Leaders must set the<BR>example. It is important to note that no country is immune from<BR>restructuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Articulating a programme and staying the course are key. New<BR>investment will respond but only with assurance - and a track record<BR>- that dying industries won't be propped up, that government will<BR>stay the course, that the process will be transparent, and that good<BR>governance will ensure all members of society participate in the<BR>resulting growth and development. Zambia has courageously embarked on<BR>a truly revolutionary course to transform political and economic<BR>structure. It has made great strides in creating the macro-economic<BR>environment and instituting the reforms of its economy and government<BR>needed to promote business and growth. It has expanded the dimensions<BR>of democracy, be it in multiparty political life, freedom of<BR>expression or toleration of NGOs and other civil institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Transforming a society is extremely difficult. It needs the<BR>support of everyone of good will, Zambians and foreigners alike. In a<BR>time of political and economic change and transformation, every<BR>decision is potentially momentous in character. In Zambia, one senses<BR>that one is always on the verge of a momentous step forward or a<BR>potentially crippling step.<BR>I am certain that with the good will and participation of all of its<BR>citizens, Zambia will move forward on the path of necessary reforms.<BR>If it maintains its commitments and stays the course, business and<BR>investment will surely follow.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - Ever since the O.J. Simpson trial a number of people have<BR>been asking me what it takes to be a lawyer. In some places like<BR>Ethiopia the situation is much like in England during the formative<BR>years of the profession. In Ethopia all one needs is to have the<BR>bravery to stand before the court to argue someone's case. One does<BR>not have to pass or sit for any examinations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guidelines: The International Bar Association has set up the<BR>following guidelines for the entry into the legal professional and<BR>legal education 1. Every person having the necessary qualifications<BR>in law shall be entitled to become a lawyer and to continue in<BR>practice without discrimination. 2. Legal education shall be open to<BR>all persons with requisite qualifications and no one shall be denied<BR>such an opportunity by reason of race, colour, sex, religion,<BR>political or other opinion, national or social origin, property,<BR>birth, status or physical disability. 3. Legal education shall be<BR>designed to promote knowledge and understanding of the role and the<BR>skills required in practising as a lawyer, including awareness of the<BR>legal and ethical duties for a lawyer and of the human rights and<BR>fundamental freedoms recognized within the given jurisdiction and by<BR>international law. 4. Programmes of legal education shall have regard<BR>to the social responsibilities of the lawyer, including cooperation<BR>in providing legal services to the needy and the promotion and<BR>defence of legal rights of whatever nature whether economic social,<BR>cultural, civil and political and especially rights of such nature in<BR>the process of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Zambia the necessary qualification is to have passed the Legal<BR>Practitioners Qualifying Examinations set by the Council Of Legal<BR>Education. Equivalent Enrolment to the Law Practice Institute is upon<BR>the Council being satisfied that the applicant possesses an LLB<BR>degree or its equivalent. Upon being called to the Bar one has a<BR>right to act as an advocate in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The course and examinations at the Law Practice Institute are<BR>notoriously difficult to ensure that only high calibre lawyers make<BR>it through. Passing the exam is not the end of the story and there is<BR>a constant need for continuing legal education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In some jurisdictions it is compulsory and it is high time it also<BR>became compulsory in Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)<BR>October 6, 1995<BR>by Elias Nyakutemba</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - And so it came to pass that the National Party (NP)<BR>failed to win even a single seat in the last round of eight<BR>parliamentary by-elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United National Independence Party (UNIP), however, cheered<BR>the whole opposition by grabbing three seats from the ruling Movement<BR>for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) in what, originally, was thought to be<BR>the MMD's political heartland, Mpulungu, Mkushi and Mbala<BR>constituencies. And nobody seems much bothered about the NP's loss.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears as if it was expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the next round of by-elections on October 10 are being viewed<BR>differently and are more crucial to the NP's overall political<BR>credibility as a third force. In focus now is the Kabompo West seat,<BR>vacated by Matthews Makayi, an Enoch Kavindele protege for years, who<BR>crossed over to the MMD and has flung himself back into the race.<BR>With Kavindele's full weight right behind him, Makayi is no pushover,<BR>even though nine out of every 10 people I met around the township<BR>(Boma) seem to think he has switched &quot;to the wrong camp, just like<BR>Kavindele when he abandoned the UDP&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For NP president Humphrey Mulemba the race could enhance or undo<BR>his much acclaimed reputation as an expert grassroots party<BR>organiser, or perhaps prove that he is in control of things in Northfigure.<BR>Western Province as its regional political heavy-weight and fatherwith the government's failure to tar the Chavuma-Mutanda road despite</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost certainly the NP will stand on a platform of real issues is the failed crop marketing strategy, declining living standards and<BR>a load of pre-election promises emerging most prominently. Then there<BR>President Chiluba's failure to give the Luvale people cabinet<BR>representation. NP candidate Benjamin Chipango remains a popular<BR>figure, having served as MP and governor for 10 years under Kaunda<BR>and UNIP whom he ditched earlier this year. And he is widely regarded<BR>as a unifying figure among the seven dialects spoken in the district.<BR>But he cannot dismiss UNIP's candidate Maliti, nor Makayi of the MMD,<BR>whose resources seem to be limitless, even though a local song there<BR>already dismiss electoral bribes as 'gifts for us, but no vote for<BR>you'. Jack Chikwenda, the MMD Independent candidate, is yet another<BR>hopeful for the NP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as things stand with MMD, some Kabompo political analysts<BR>believe Chikwenda may soon be forced to fall out of the race to avoid<BR>splitting the MMD vote count further. Most crucial too is the fact<BR>that all the candidates are from the Luchazi-speaking clan, a subZambezi districts, followed by Lunda speakers who are more pronounced<BR>cluster of the Luvale web of dialects which dominates Kabompo and<BR>in the eastern parts of Kabompo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traditionally, a Lunda-Luvale (minus Luchazi) swing has always<BR>been the decisive factor in winning any elections in the west. But<BR>whether the NP will mobilise this vote effectively remains open to<BR>debate. According to observers in Kabompo, the MMD is more likely to<BR>rely on Kavindele's immense influence in most Luchazi-speaking areas<BR>and, not surprisingly, on whipping up emotions on such trivialities<BR>as the need to teach Luchazi in schools or to be made the eighth<BR>language on radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever happens, it is clear that none of the candidates will<BR>find it easy to win a majority vote in a region already fraught with<BR>abject poverty, disease and hunger, but which still clings to a<BR>rather hazy hope for prosperity and decency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)<BR>October 6, 1995<BR>by Wajid Patel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - Whenever there are elections, aspiring politicians go out<BR>and make a lot of promises to the people. During such times<BR>politicians are usually available to the electorate. Those with any<BR>questions are usually afforded time to pose them and wherever<BR>possible answers are provided.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During campaigns candidates are generally believed to be free<BR>spenders, and those around them are usually lucky enough to find a<BR>few kwachas in their pockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The candidates are quick to remind all who care to listen that the<BR>people are the masters while the politicians are servants. They give<BR>the impression that as far as they are concerned their aim and<BR>purpose in life is work for their masters who are the voters. But<BR>once elected, however, the whole picture quickly changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So drastic is the change that one is justified to ask whether<BR>politicians are indeed servants of the people or the people servants<BR>of the politicians. From the councillors to members of parliament<BR>once elected all cease to consult the people. Their ideas become the<BR>standards of what should be done in their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who wish to carry any business venture in their areas have<BR>to show they recognise the authority of their councillor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for MPs, the situation is even worse. Once elected the MPs,<BR>save for very few, become very scarce in the areas they represent.<BR>When issues affecting the people are about to be discussed such as<BR>the land bill the MPs do not care to get the views of their<BR>constituents. They become the embodiment of collective wisdom of<BR>their constituents even if their remarkable attribute is dullness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation becomes even more serious when individuals who form<BR>the government make up their own mind. It appears the wishes of the<BR>citizens just do not matter. Presently various sections of our<BR>community including churches have said the new constitution be<BR>adopted through a constituent assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government, who are the people's servants, have said no, and<BR>their refusal will carry the day.Afterwards they will of course sit<BR>back and say they are merely following the people's will.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - Concerns about corruption in the MMD started even before<BR>the party got into government. Ephraim Chibwe, President Frederick<BR>Chiluba's uncle and interim MMD treasurer, failed to produce audited<BR>party accounts at the party's first convention in February 1991.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To date the millions the party received from supporters and wellSince Chiluba took office in 1991 corruption accusations have come<BR>wishers has not be accounted for. And Chibwe still remains protected.<BR>both from within and outside the MMD and its government, but Chiluba<BR>has not only continued to deny the existence of corruption in his<BR>government but has also been permissive to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chibwe is still to be prosecuted for alleged theft of public<BR>funds.  Health minister Michael Sata was saved from prosecution in<BR>the name &quot;of public interest&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)<BR>October 6, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - Last week's attacks on Zambia Civic Association<BR>chairperson Lucy Sichone by the convenor of the Human Rights<BR>Committee of the Law Association, Willie Mubanga, in defence of the<BR>integrity of judges was hypocritical. It is difficult to be convinced<BR>that Mubanga's main concern was the defence of the integrity of the<BR>judges and not the bringing down of the standing of Sichone in the<BR>eyes of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Any person who has, without political prejudices, observed<BR>Zambia's judicial processes since the Movement for Multiparty<BR>Democracy assumed power in November 1991 will agree that the greatest<BR>danger to the integrity of our judicial officers lurks in the<BR>insidious encroachment on them of the top ranking members of our<BR>executive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attacks of the executive, especially President Frederick<BR>Chiluba, on the judiciary have often been couched in seemingly well<BR>meaning but dangerously manipulative complaints and 'enquiries' on<BR>the performance of the courts on matters in which they have direct or<BR>indirect interests - mainly of a political nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mubanga has not attacked these encroachments with the<BR>viciousness that he unleashed on defenceless Sichone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conduct of some High Court and Supreme Courts judges and<BR>magistrates also undermines the integrity of judicial officers in<BR>general. It would be folly to think these can be left to the judicial<BR>officers themselves to determine and resolve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We should also be mindful that it is possible for some judicial<BR>officers from the subordinate courts up to the Supreme Court to take<BR>partisan positions in the manner they deal with cases and people<BR>before them. Ask any lawyer or politician today in this country about<BR>where each of our High Court and Supreme Court judges stand, they<BR>will tell you those that are neutral, those that are pro-ruling MMD<BR>and those that they think are sympathetic to former president Kenneth<BR>Kaunda. Of course they won't have the courage to say so publicly. It<BR>has to be in confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who are MMD know the politics that were there in the<BR>appointment of Chief Justice Matthew Ngulube as Chief Justice instead<BR>of Bonaventure Bweupe purely on regional or tribal lines. All this<BR>took place at a State House MMD caucus called for the purpose.  Those<BR>who are close to the 'inner' circles of the MMD know how a<BR>'sympathetic' subordinate court official found his way to the High<BR>Court. These are the matters that undermine the integrity of judges.<BR>These are the practices that should be viciously fought by all those<BR>who hold dear the ideals of an independent judiciary .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All Zambians, save for those with powers to manipulate, would like<BR>to see practical steps taken to protect and enhance the independence<BR>and integrity of our courts. If Mubanga and his colleagues want to be<BR>seen as champions of judicial independence they have to convince us<BR>they can attack the powerful men of our country who are daily<BR>undermining the integrity of our courts. Taking on defenceless<BR>Sichone is cowardice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We challenge Mubanga to stick his teeth into the buttocks of the<BR>real and dangerous enemies of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)<BR>October 6, 1995<BR>by Sundie Sinkala</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA - Great fun at this year's Miss Zambia was spoiled by five<BR>star Pamodzi Hotel's failure to live up to its expectations when it<BR>could not cope with thousands of patrons who went to watch the<BR>prestigious contest last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather than go by its motto of &quot;you come as a guest and leave as a<BR>friend&quot;, most of the night's guests left the place disgusted because<BR>of the shoddy arrangements. Hundreds of thirsty throats thronged the<BR>usually tranquil residents' lounge after both alcoholic and nonhotel's lawns near the swimming pool. As for the seating<BR>alcoholic beverages ran out at the makeshift bars located in the<BR>arrangements, many people stood throughout the four-hour plus<BR>duration of the pageant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But resident manager Ranjiv Singh defended the hotel and<BR>attributed the confusion to &quot;disorganisation&quot; on the part of the<BR>organisers. &quot;They told us to expect 1,200 guests but we have over<BR>5,000 people here,&quot; an overwhelmed Singh said in an interview during<BR>the confusion. Even the prohibitive price of K1,200 per Mosi bottle<BR>and K2,500 per canned beer could not discourage customers from<BR>waiting for over half an hour before their turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't think I can stay here anymore, there are just too many<BR>people. I have never seen such a scene in this hotel,&quot; said one<BR>disappointed ex-Zambia National Service captain after failing to buy<BR>his drinks. The situation deteriorated so much that the beverage<BR>manager himself, Singh, had to come to serve customers, some of<BR>whom were already shouting abuse at the management for their lack of<BR>preparation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the organisers defended his colleagues, saying there was<BR>nothing wrong in having so many people at such a function. He said<BR>Pamodzi was a five-star hotel which should have been able to cater<BR>for such a crowd. In fact, he said, it was a good thing that more<BR>people than expected attended the function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Miss Zambia crown was scooped by an 'O' level student<BR>Mariyana Bujisic while the second prize went to Muleya Mwananyanda, a<BR>former Post reporter, and the third prize to Annie McCall who works<BR>at Polo Grill. The occasion was also graced by the presence of CBN<BR>News anchor man Victor Oladukun as one of the panel judges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Simataa said the coaches will also be entitled to daily allowances<BR>once they are in camp and the winning bonus for every game played.<BR>Other details of the contract were not disclosed as they were<BR>awaiting approval from the FAZ main committee. &quot;As at now I can't say<BR>how much money the coaches will be paid because we haven't decided as<BR>an executive on that. But we will meet soon to decide how much to pay<BR>them, I think it will give them a lot of encouragement ,&quot; says<BR>Simataa. &quot;We want them to go to the Africa Cup with a lot of<BR>encouragement and try their best, if we don't appreciate their work,<BR>then their morale could be down,&quot; said Simataa in an interview at the<BR>FAZ offices in Lusaka on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Melu, one of the national team assistant trainers, welcomed the<BR>idea of introducing contracts for local coaches attached to the<BR>national team saying &quot;it was long overdue&quot; &quot;I think we (coaches) must<BR>now give credit where it is due, this is a well-timed move by this<BR>new executive as it will give us job security and motivation. It's<BR>now up to us to try our best ,&quot; said Melu in a telephone interview on<BR>Tuesday. Coaches were previously only paid after every game and some<BR>upkeep allowance during the preparation of any game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We only used to get very little money. On top of the salaries<BR>paid for each game, we also used to get some up-keep allowances,&quot;<BR>explained Melu, &quot;but I can't tell you how much our salaries were.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>October 6, 1995<BR>by Jon Swift</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The United Cricket Board is taking the game to the<BR>people, and not just South Africa's people but to other countries in<BR>Africa as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a certain strangeness about the notion that international<BR>cricket will be played at Paarl. In the recent South African<BR>experience the Boland town is a place where top cyclists come from<BR>and they have a big Boxing Day athletics meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also something novel about the thought that this country<BR>will be playing one-day internationals against Kenya. In recent<BR>memory, that has been the home of Kilimanjaro and nothing much else<BR>except some of the world's best coffee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But then, relying on the memeory of history since the Sixties is a<BR>dangerous business in this country's truly remarkable transformation<BR>and the thrust sport has added to the impetus of our changing<BR>perceptions about one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It should not be a surprise that Boland have been awarded one of<BR>the limited overs internationals during next year's tours by India<BR>and Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not when the oft-stated policy of cricket's administrators is to<BR>bring the game to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And then there is the first Test against the English being played<BR>in Pretoria of all places! Again, the more natural association is<BR>with snorting forwards and kicking flyhalves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But then Centurion Park is one of the most charming venues in the<BR>South African game and has been voted a fine venue by both local<BR>players and touring sides. It is also a fine venue from the<BR>spectator's point of view. You are close to the action and there are<BR>acres of grass to relax on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is the feeling that the air you are breathing is neither<BR>bottled nor hemmed in by concrete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The free-flowing spirit of the game lives at Centurion Park. All<BR>that remains now is to lather the Poms within its green confines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adding to this emphasis on the game in Pretoria is the way the<BR>United Cricket Board's Ali Bacher sees it. &quot;We have to help promote a<BR>Test culture, a cricket culture in the province,&quot; he says. And so, a<BR>Test match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya is a different matter al-together, but equally heartening in<BR>the examination. By agreeing to be part of a four-nation tournament,<BR>which also includes India and Pakistan, the game in this country has<BR>owned up to two important things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First that we are truly African and justly proud of being part of<BR>the promotion of the world's greatest game on the ineptly named Dark<BR>Continent. And second that the traditional ties which kept the game<BR>going in the years of apartheid, while still important, are no longer<BR>the paramount factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UCB is also eager to spread this intial net -- the<BR>quadrangular tournament takes place next September-October -- to our<BR>closer neighbours Zimbabwe and Namibia. This is an equally healthy<BR>move towards real progress as the sporting citizens of the world we<BR>have lately been re-instateed as.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is in South Africa's interests to try and help with the<BR>promotion of the game of cricket in Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya,&quot;<BR>says Bacher. &quot;If we can create strong structures in those regions it<BR>will upgrade the standard of cricket on the continent.&quot; Just so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sooner the harsh edges of recent memories are softened by real<BR>progress the better. Making inroads into Africa is a start, just as<BR>is spreading the gate money of the big international matches as<BR>widely as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hence the game at Paarl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One senses that it is not beyond the bounds of reason to suggest<BR>that this expansion will not end with our neighbours and the foray to<BR>Kenya. This road, once travelled, could lead to such exotic<BR>destinations as Dar es Salaam and Marrakesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the widening of the international net from the traditional<BR>Test centres can only have the effect of adding further bloom to the<BR>development programme so firmly in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I await the five-day Test match in Soweto. For can it really be<BR>that far away?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>October 6, 1995<BR>by Jon Swift</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Youcan't help feeling that the International Rugby<BR>Board (IRB) has done yet again what history shows it to have done<BR>best ... dither.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly, the latest set of guidelines -- predictably, still to<BR>be finalised -- issued by the august body following their meeting in<BR>Tokyo does little to address the real issues of the new pay- for-play<BR>era which must have some delegates weeping into their gin and tonics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In essence, the IRB has opened the path to professionalism at all<BR>levels. But they have kept a clause which protects countries &quot;that<BR>wish to remain amateur or are less wealthy than others&quot;. It looks<BR>very much like a question of having your cake and eating it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly, the irony of the guidelines being issued from Tokyo<BR>cannot have escaped the IRB. The Japanese may have been, along with<BR>the Ivory Coast, the whipping boys of the World Cup, but you only<BR>have to look at the flood of All Blacks -- Ant Strachan, Arran Pene<BR>and Jamie Joseph are among the latest -- who are on their way to the<BR>land of the rising yen to know that there is big money in Japanese<BR>rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it probably doesn't compare with the reported R12-million the<BR>Brisbane Bulldogs offered Northern Transvaal's Springbok scrumhalf<BR>Joost van der Westhuizen to switch to the 13-man game. Van der<BR>Westhuizen turned it down, preferring to honour his contract with the<BR>South African Rugby Football Union. A contract some R9,5-million shy<BR>of the Australian offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would seem that there is equally big money in this country.<BR>But, regardless of the amounts on offer, the IRB has still not<BR>grasped the nettle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You are either professional or not. No high-minded and undoubtedly<BR>well-intentioned words can change the fact that the game -- at<BR>international and senior level, that is -- has changed for all time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yes, that will mean hardships for countries like Western Samoa<BR>and Fiji. but then these rugby nations have served as feeder<BR>countries for their more well-endowed neighbours, New Zealand and<BR>Australia, for a number of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All, though, is not gloom and despondency although the flow of<BR>players from the South Sea Islands to the well-paid teams in the<BR>Antipodes will surely increase to a torrent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One would suspect that we are likely to see more top Five Nations<BR>players arriving for the Currie Cup season too. Especially in the<BR>light of the French federation deciding on a complex system of partThe IRB has made the point that, while players are free to sell<BR>time professionalism as their answer to the lure of the big buck.<BR>their services to the highest bidder, the considerations of national<BR>selection take preference. This seems like a statement which will be<BR>a lot easier to legislate than enforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What they need to do is insert a clause in every player's contract<BR>which binds the club, province or state he plays for to pick up that<BR>player's wage bill while he is away on national duty. This would hold<BR>especially for the wealthy nations the IRB has emphasised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If they fail to do so, the possibility exists of any number of<BR>injuries happening just prior to selection of, for instance, a<BR>touring team which will be away for months on end and potentially<BR>cost the player in question a great deal of money.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>October 6, 1995<BR>by Meshack Mabogoane</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Despite the recent nurses' and municipal workers'<BR>strikes, this year's figures show industrial unrest to be at its<BR>lowest in five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The impression of industrial chaos is more a reaction to the<BR>unusually low figures for the first half of this year and the high<BR>profile nature of the strikes that have occurred during this<BR>quarter,&quot; says labour analyst, Andrew Sparks of Andrew Levy and<BR>Associates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Compared to 1992, the peak strike year when more than threeindicate that only 870 000 man-days were lost. The average number of<BR>million man-days were lost, the first three-quarters of this year<BR>man- days lost over a five year period were 2,6-million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the third quarter of this year about 775 000 man-days were lost<BR>as compared to a five year average of 1,8-million man-days. The<BR>third-quarter figures are of greater significance as this is the<BR>period of wage negotiations when the unions show their muscle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The low level of strike action this year can be attributed to<BR>several factors. Politically- motivated and non-wage issue-based<BR>strikes have become insignificant. Direct involvement of unions in<BR>the anti-apartheid campaigns is something of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The struggle for worker control on the shop floors has abated<BR>largely due to deliberations that have led to the new Labour<BR>Relations Act that would give workers powers within the work place,&quot;<BR>says Sparks. There is also the feeling that the levelling off of<BR>strikes is due to a high degree of sophistication and experience by<BR>both workers and management which has led to a better handling of<BR>grievances, retrenchment procedures and less antagonism between the<BR>negotiating parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Non-wage disputes account for only four percent of man-days lost<BR>while strike action triggered by wages takes up to 93 percent. For<BR>1995 this has been the most outstanding feature of industrial action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the first time public sector, and parastatal workers have been<BR>at the forefront of wage-related strikes. In contrast to the private<BR>sector actions were large and nationwide and continued for a<BR>relatively longer period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lid has been lifted off these workers since the present<BR>government, unlike the previous one, allows public servants to go on<BR>strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides the relatively low wages that nurses, for example, have<BR>been receiving, the restriction on public sector increases to less<BR>than five percent has meant that they were getting below inflation<BR>salary rises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In contrast, private sector workers' increases have been settled<BR>at 10 to 12 percent in keeping with inflation. Thus the disparity<BR>between public and private sectors has widened -- leading to toyiOther major factors that helped trigger public sector strike<BR>toying by public servants.<BR>action have been greater expectations of the new government and the<BR>poor state of the public sector industrial relations system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The past restrictions on strike action by public servants is, of<BR>course, the main cause of the latter. Nurses have not had a union and<BR>the South African Nursing Association, a professional body, made a<BR>top down settlement that was rejected. Calls have been made for<BR>nurses to form a union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And there are moves afoot to form a super public- sector union for<BR>effective central bargaining. Sources expect the National Education,<BR>Health and Allied Workers Union, Nehawu, and the South African<BR>Municipal Workers Union, Samwu, to lead the way by forming a merger<BR>in November. The Post and Telecommunications Workers Association,<BR>Potwa, had indicated an interest in the umbrella union but is yet to<BR>take the final step once its own struggles with the could- beSuch prospects could spell a difficult period ahead should issues,<BR>restructured Telkom are resolved.<BR>including wages, and public-sector industrial relations systems<BR>remain unresolved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>October 6, 1995<BR>by Trevor Steele Taylor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - First steps have been taken towards a collaboration<BR>which could be of resounding importance to South African film. At a<BR>symposium in Johannesburg last weekend, organised by the French<BR>Institute, plans were mooted for a film treaty between France and<BR>South Africa which would provide South Africans with access to<BR>European funding and distribution avenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prime mover behind the initiative for official French/South<BR>African co-productions is France's Centre National de la<BR>Cinematographie (CNC), represented at the symposium by director of<BR>international affairs Didier Decaudaveine. Decaudaveine outlined the<BR>proposal, which was then submitted to the Ministry of Arts, Culture,<BR>Science and Technology for consideration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Should an official stamp of approval be given to the accord, South<BR>African film-makers will have access to European funding and other<BR>resources as French/South African co-productions will qualify as<BR>European.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the symposium, Antoine de Clermont- Tonnerre, producer<BR>of Giuseppe Tornatore's Cinema Paradiso, said that for indigenous<BR>cinema to survive the Hollywood invasion, limitations have to be<BR>placed on American product. France has been a frontrunner in<BR>implementing this policy, endorsing a quota system which promotes<BR>European films on French screens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Europe is particularly conscious of the need for an infrastructure<BR>for film development, De Clermont- Tonnerre said. Funds such as the<BR>Herbert Bals Fund at the Rotterdam Film Festival and the European<BR>Script Development Fund are critical in terms of providing seed<BR>finance for projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Decaudaveine said the French system of film financing has been in<BR>position since 1947, and despite changes in government has always<BR>received official support. French respect for film as an art form has<BR>been largely responsible for the success of the French film industry,<BR>which after Hollywood, India and Egypt is one of the largest in the<BR>world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jacques Bidou, an independent producer and specialist in African<BR>co-productions, was also present at the symposium. Bidou, who is<BR>currently working on the first South African/ French co- production,<BR>Fools, to be directed by Ramadan Suleiman, cautioned that, valuable<BR>as the accord will be, the real creative energy for a vibrant South<BR>African film industry will need to come from within.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Newswatch (Lagos)<BR>October 9, 1995<BR>by Nats Agbo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS - Last week was the busiest in Aso Rock since Sani Abacha<BR>became head of state in November 1993.  From Wednesday when an<BR>emergency meeting of the Federal Executive Council, FEC, commenced<BR>until 4:00 a.m. on Sunday when the head of state finally recorded his<BR>October 1 Independence anniversary broadcast, the seat of government<BR>was a beehive of activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Abacha had promised to announce a transition time-table on<BR>October 1, many politicians had converged on Abuja.  Most of them, it<BR>was learnt, had hoped that speculations in the press that a prime<BR>minister was to be appointed would become a reality.  In fact, some<BR>were seen campaigning for a piece of the action in any political<BR>arrangement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was also learnt that earlier in the week, there were<BR>indications that a prominent politician would be appointed prime<BR>minister last Sunday.  Those who were peddling the story even named<BR>Ernest Shonekan, a former head of state and Joseph Wayas, former<BR>Senate leader, as likely candidates.  Investigations showed that it<BR>was actually a mere speculation and that Shonekan, who read the<BR>report in a daily newspaper, described it as &quot;rubbish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Wayas, however, it was a serious problem.  One of his protocol<BR>officers, possibly an aggrieved one, also heard that his boss was<BR>being mentioned in connection with the appointment of a prime<BR>minister.  He prepared a dossier on Wayas, detailing some of his<BR>shady deals with the government.  The information was said to be very<BR>damaging and could have scuttled the ambition of the former senate<BR>president.  His children and some security agents visited several<BR>news media offices in Abuja, hoping to stop the publication of the<BR>information contained in said document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An Aso Rock source said the meeting of the FEC, the military<BR>administrators and Diya and the PRC were &quot;deliberately long to ensure<BR>that all national issues at stake are properly discussed and<BR>resolved.&quot; In all the meetings, there were heated arguments on such<BR>issues as power-sharing, creation of more states and local government<BR>areas, a new revenue allocation formula and the fate of those<BR>convicted for plotting the overthrow of the federal military<BR>government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to an Aso Rock source, Abacha's speech was ready by<BR>Wednesday.  Some copies were even smuggled out and given to some<BR>reporters.  But what they did not know was that what was smuggled out<BR>was just a draft.  Abacha himself had planned to modify the draft<BR>after the series of meetings which he held with the various groups<BR>last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the ministers and military administrators agreed with<BR>most of the issues raised in the original draft of the speech,<BR>members of the PRC had a rancorous debate on all the issues.  It was<BR>at this stage that the creation of six new states, earlier approved<BR>by the ministers and administrators, was deferred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some parts of the speech were handwritten.  The lifting of the<BR>embargo on new employment was, for instance, inserted in red ink by<BR>Abacha just as he was about to start recording his speech.  The last<BR>page of the speech was also handwritten by the head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The speech was, therefore, essentially a product of the final<BR>decision of the PRC on Friday and Saturday.  In his speech, Abacha<BR>said he was &quot;particularly gratified by the frankness of the<BR>deliberations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the first issues resolved was that of power sharing.  At<BR>the ministers level, a minister from one of the Middle Belt states<BR>was said to have opposed the application of the principle of rotation<BR>to all tiers of government.  When asked if he did not want a minority<BR>group in his state to be governor, he said: &quot;If the other group<BR>brings up an acceptable candidate, of course, we will vote for him.&quot;<BR>This caused laughter at the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PRC, however, resolved that the principle of rotation should<BR>&quot;apply to all levels of government.&quot; In his speech, Abacha said:<BR>&quot;It is hoped that with the adoption of this system, all segments of<BR>society will feel a sense of belonging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the head of state, the PRC chose a presidential<BR>system in which there shall be president, vice-president, prime<BR>minister and deputy prime minister, along with the senate president<BR>and the speaker of the house of representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These posts will be held on rotational basis among six<BR>geographical zones: North-East, North-West, Middle Belt(initially<BR>erroneously identified as North-Central in Abacha's speech), Southnew power sharing arrangement shall be entrenched in the constitution<BR>West, South East and Southern Minority.  Abacha explained that the<BR>and shall be &quot;applicable for an experimental period of 30 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from announcing the adoption of the multi-partism, the head<BR>of state outlined a political transition time-table to terminate on<BR>October 1, 1998.  According to the programme, the first phase of the<BR>transition will begin this month with the approval of the draft<BR>constitution, lifting of all restrictions on political activities and<BR>establishment of the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria, NECON.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between October and December, the government would set up a<BR>transitional implementation committee, a national reconciliation<BR>committee and the Federal Character commission.  Another panel would<BR>also be set up on the creation of states and local government areas,<BR>and boundary adjustment issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between January and March 1996, elections into local government<BR>councils on non-party basis would take place.  In the second quarter<BR>of 1996, new states and local government councils would emerge.  The<BR>process of party registration would also commence but it is only<BR>between July and September that political parties would be<BR>registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New constituencies would be delineated at the same time that a new<BR>voters' register is being prepared.  By the end of 1996, fresh<BR>elections into local government councils on party basis would be<BR>held.  What that means is that those who will be voted into office in<BR>January 1996 will spend only nine days in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1997, the transition programme will be in full steam with the<BR>inauguration of elected council officials, consolidation of new<BR>political structures and conduct of any bye-elections arising from<BR>proceedings of election tribunals.  The second quarter of 1997 would,<BR>however witness only party state primaries to select candidates for<BR>state assemblies and governorship elections as well as the screening<BR>of nominated candidates.  But while state assembly elections would be<BR>held in the third quarter of 1997, state governors will emerge only<BR>in the last quarter of the same year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the governors and state assembly men would not take office<BR>until the first quarter of 1998.  Within that first quarter also,<BR>campaigns and primaries for nomination of candidates for national<BR>assembly elections would commence.  Elections to the national<BR>assembly would be conducted in the second quarter of 1998, the same<BR>time the primaries to select candidates for presidential elections<BR>would be conducted.  Campaigns for the presidential elections would<BR>also begin while the election itself would hold between July and<BR>September, giving Abacha enough room to hand over to an elected<BR>president on October 1, 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1998 exit date did not come as surprise.  Plans to prolong<BR>Abacha's rule until 1998 unfolded early in the life of the<BR>administration when government seemed resolved to be silent on its<BR>political transition programme.  This strategy of remaining silent<BR>worked for the government until April last year when David Mark, a<BR>retired brigadier-general and key participant in the Abacha coup,<BR>punctured the silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark, in an interview granted Newswatch, alleged that during the<BR>planning stages of the coup, a constitutional conference was seen by<BR>Abacha and Oladipo Diya, his second in command, only as a ploy to<BR>prolong the stay of the military in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government, rattled by Mark's revelation, hastily announced what<BR>it called &quot;the first phase&quot; of its transition to civil rule.  If that<BR>programme had been implemented, the new constitution, which is still<BR>in the works, would have been released by December 30, 1994, and on<BR>January 16, 1995, the second phase of Abacha's political transition<BR>programme would have been flagged off.  The ban on political<BR>activities would also have been completely lifted by January 17,<BR>1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As it later turned out, the constitutional conference, which<BR>Abacha and his officials often said would determine their exit date,<BR>did not only delay the submission of the draft constitution but gave<BR>government a blank cheque on the exit date.  The conference submitted<BR>its report(draft constitution) June 27, exactly one year after it was<BR>inaugurated, as against four months that it was supposed to have<BR>lasted.  The conference asked the military to fix its own exit date<BR>at its earliest convenience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even government's action on the conference heightened fears that<BR>it planned to control the conference to do its own bidding.  For<BR>instance, the 369-member conference was made up of 96 governmentconference so that most of the delegates will be strangulated into<BR>nominated delegates was to constitute a pressure group within the<BR>implementing a political transition programme which will terminate in<BR>1998,' says a Newswatch source in its report of January 23, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government only fell short of following to the letter the<BR>transition programme which had earlier been canvassed by pro-military<BR>campaigners.  If that programme published in the Newswatch edition of<BR>January 23, 1995, was followed to the letter by Abacha, elections<BR>into the local government councils and state houses of assembly would<BR>have been held in early 1997, with the governorship election to be<BR>held within the same period. Government was asked to conduct the<BR>house of representatives election in July 1997, while that of the<BR>senate would have come up in September 1997 and the presidential<BR>election in November of the same year, in anticipation of a possible<BR>handover of power to civilians on January 2, 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The head of state also announced the devolution of more powers to<BR>the states.  Although a committee is still to be set up to work out<BR>modalities and guidelines on the issue, he said the lower tiers of<BR>government should be allowed to handle matters relating to health,<BR>education, agriculture, roads and housing.  He added that the PRC was<BR>convinced that &quot;the competition for political offices at the federal<BR>level may become less intense, less attractive or acrimonious if some<BR>federal powers are devolved to states and local government councils.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National constitutional Conference had resolved that all<BR>federal universities be handed over to stated in which they are<BR>located.  This policy of devolution of powers may be a reaction to<BR>that recommendation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha had a few surprises for Nigerians though.  His<BR>deproscription of the Punch and Concord newspapers was unexpected. He<BR>said &quot;any fair-minded observer will testify that our news media which<BR>do not go beyond the law, are free to express their views even<BR>sometimes to the extent of astonishing and confusing foreign visitors<BR>who had been led to believe that Nigeria is a police state.&quot; He<BR>added that The Guardian, Punch, and Concord newspapers were shut<BR>initially because they were aiding and abetting civil disorder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agitators for the creation of new states and local government<BR>areas also had their ambitions punctured.  Although the head of state<BR>announced that a committee would be set up on the requests, leaders<BR>of many of the groups were disappointed that the states were not<BR>created immediately.  Two weeks before the meeting of the PRC,<BR>leaders of these groups resumed their campaigns in newspapers and<BR>among ministers and members of the PRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of the council of ministers meeting, some of the<BR>leaders had received feelers that at least six states would be<BR>created.  On the strength of that information, some of the groups had<BR>made elaborate arrangements to celebrate the occasion.  Abacha said<BR>&quot;It is consistent with our policy of having a balanced federation<BR>that the aspirations of our people of self-determination which have<BR>been expressed in the demands for new states and local governments be<BR>considered on their merit.&quot; According to the transition time-table,<BR>new states would now be created in the second quarter o f1996.  The<BR>new states and local government councils would however, be created if<BR>the new committee to be set up by Abacha approves of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another key surprise in the head of state's broadcast is<BR>government's decision to commute the sentences passed on the alleged<BR>coup plotters by the Patrick Aziza military tribunal.  The tribunal<BR>had on July 14, convicted 40 of the 51 people it tried.  The convicts<BR>included Olusegun Obasanjo, former head of state, Shehu Musa<BR>Yar'Adua, Obasanjo's former deputy, Lawan Gwadabe, former governor of<BR>Niger State, several other serving and retired military officers,<BR>four journalists and a few other civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fourteen of the convicts, including Yar'Adua and Gwadabe were<BR>allegedly sentenced to death while the others bagged jail terms<BR>ranging from ten years to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the nation awaited Abacha's broadcast last Sunday, it was hard<BR>to imagine that there were plans to commute the sentences.  Last<BR>Monday, when a delegation of traditional rulers from Lagos State<BR>appealed to Abacha to pardon the convicts, he told them there was a<BR>need to shun sentiments.  &quot;We appreciate the personalities of the<BR>individuals involved, but the law is the law.  Where there is no law,<BR>we can as well turn into a jungle,&quot; he told them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking further, Abacha said: &quot;Nobody is above the law of this<BR>land, and the sooner we respect this, the better for the stability of<BR>our country.&quot; He added that the law is not made for two categories<BR>of people, neither is the law a respecter of persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With such hard stance coming from the head of state only a few<BR>days before the independence broadcast, it was suspected in several<BR>quarters that government would carry out the sentences passed by the<BR>tribunal.  The suspicion was heightened further when activities were<BR>stepped up at the Kirikiri maximum security prison where nine of<BR>those condemned to death are being held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More soldiers were drafted to the prison while the execution<BR>ground was cleared.  The stakes and the drums behind them were also<BR>prepared for what looked an imminent execution.  Soldiers and antithat would erupt after the broadcast.<BR>riot policemen were positioned in readiness for what seemed the chaos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The broadcast, however, made all these an anti-climax.  Abacha<BR>attributes the decision to commute the sentences to the &quot;earnest<BR>pleas of our friends and in the spirit of national reconciliation<BR>which has been the centre-piece of this administration's policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the history of coup trials in the country,, this is the first<BR>time the death sentences of those convicted for plotting a coup would<BR>be commuted.  In 1976, 32 officers were executed for their complicity<BR>in the abortive Dimka coup.  Similarly, 10 military officers were<BR>executed for their role in the botched Vatsa coup.  Then in 1990, 42<BR>service men were executed for their role in the abortive Okar coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prevailing circumstances may have influenced Abacha's deviation<BR>from the convention.  There had been considerable pressure both from<BR>within and outside the country on the government to commute the<BR>sentences.  From within the country, prominent Nigerians, including<BR>former heads of state, retired senior military officers, traditional<BR>rulers, politicians and other prominent Nigerians mounted pressure on<BR>the government to commute the sentences.  From within the country,<BR>prominent Nigerians, including former heads of state retired senior<BR>military officers, traditional rulers, politicians and other<BR>prominent Nigerians mounted pressure on the government to commute the<BR>sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pleas from abroad were even more significant.  Some of these<BR>were backed by threats of sanctions.  These include those from the<BR>United States of America, Britain and some other Western countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Moshood Abiola, Abacha said those who describe him as a<BR>political prisoner &quot;seek to trivialise the grave offence for which he<BR>is charged.&quot; He said politicians had agreed on the formation of the<BR>Interim National Government, ING, adding that &quot;Abiola not only<BR>publicly called upon the military to intervene, he actively<BR>participated in selecting the broad-based cabinet of the new<BR>administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saying that Nigeria had moved beyond the controversy surrounding<BR>June 12, 1993, he added: &quot;We cannot make progress by flogging dead<BR>issues or pretending that matters which long since have been<BR>overtaken by events, should be exhumed and given fresh death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saying that Nigeria had moved beyond the controversy surrounding<BR>June 12, 1993, he added: &quot;We cannot make progress by flogging dead<BR>issues or pretending that matters which long since have been<BR>overtaken by events, should be exhumed and given fresh death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Abiola's release from detention would be determined only<BR>by a court of law because &quot;it would be wrong and poor precedent for<BR>the democratic system for which we are laying a foundation to invoke<BR>executive fiat in a matter that is still subjudice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether the new political agenda would pacify leaders of the<BR>National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, other pro-democracy groups<BR>will become obvious this week.  But last week, pressure was still<BR>being mounted on Abacha to step aside.  On Saturday, Wole Soyinka<BR>told a political meeting in Central London that he had set up an<BR>underground resistance movement in Nigeria.  &quot;We are committed to the<BR>removal of the Abacha regime by all means necessary,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before Abacha announced the transition programme, the Nigerian<BR>Pro-Democracy Network, NPDN, an umbrella organisation of 14<BR>democratic pressure groups formed by Nigerians in the United States<BR>and Canada had indicated that it would not respect the programme.<BR>The NPDN emerged from its first summit held at the Howard University,<BR>Washington on September 23, asked Abacha to announce his &quot;immediate<BR>retirement and the return of the military to the barracks.&quot; Failing<BR>that, the group threatened to put more pressure on the US Congress to<BR>pass into law a bill which has gone through second reading to impose<BR>sanctions against Nigeria for &quot;malfeasance regarding drugs<BR>trafficking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NPDN whose member-groups have been in the vanguard of the<BR>campaign for actualisation of the June 12, 1993 presidential<BR>election, stated that &quot;a government of national unity should be<BR>installed immediately.&quot; Chris<BR>Alli, a major-general and former chief of army staff, retired by<BR>Abacha in September last year is the NPDN's choice to lead the<BR>transition team which will hand over to Moshood Abiola January 1,<BR>next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are indications that the reaction of the international<BR>community to the transition programme would be determined by how well<BR>it is implemented.  As Banji Idowu, a Lagos lawyer said last week,<BR>&quot;the international community is already becoming impatient with<BR>Nigeria and the earlier the military leaves office, the better for<BR>this country.  Perhaps the international community would have a<BR>change of heart on Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Idowu held that the transition programme was too long, he<BR>saw the programme itself as a consolation and evidence that in the<BR>end, the military would leave the stage for politicians.  Politicians<BR>are however, likening the Abacha regime's transition to that of<BR>former President Ibrahim Babangida.  When Babangida started his<BR>transition to civil rule programme a few years ago, he employed the<BR>same method Abacha has now adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first elections into local government councils were on nonfor the multi-party system.  In the end, he refused to register<BR>party basis.  He had also given the impression that he had sympathy<BR>political associations formed by politicans.  Instead, he formed two<BR>political parties, the Social Democratic Party, SDP, and the National<BR>Republican Convention, NRC, and asked politicians to join them.  It<BR>was discovered theat Babangida used such tactics to prolong his stay<BR>in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Would Abacha follow the same path?  &quot;Yes,&quot; says a politician who<BR>added: &quot;All the indications are there, that we are into another long<BR>military rule.&quot; but Abacha sees such views as emanating from<BR>&quot;detractors who deliberately persist in a blinkered view of us and<BR>our efforts (and ) fail to take account of all that we have achieved<BR>in so short a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WASHINGTON - An exhibition of works by Tuareg and Moor smiths,<BR>renowned for their creativity and mastery of complex metalwork<BR>techniques, opened September 6, at the Smithsonian's National Museum<BR>of African Art, 950 Independence Avenue., S.W. , Washington, DC. &quot;Art<BR>from the Forge,&quot; on view through January 2 in the museum's first<BR>level Point of View Gallery, features metal jewelry, ceremonial arms<BR>and objects of personal use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tuareg and Moors are traditionally nomadic peoples who inhabit<BR>portions of West and North Africa. During the 1970s and 1980s a<BR>severe drought caused both peoples to migrate to nearby cities where<BR>many established sedentary lives. Living in close proximity, Tuareg<BR>and Moor smiths, both with distinct artistic traditions, have begun<BR>to incorporate aspects of one another's designs, motifs and<BR>techniques. This is reflected in the works on view.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of the objects are made from materials of the highest quality<BR>and have smooth, shiny surfaces and carefully rendered motifs. &quot;These<BR>smiths skillfully balance form and decoration as they in corporate<BR>Tuareg and Moor aesthetic criteria into the objects they create,&quot;<BR>said Andrea Nicolls, curator of the exhibition. For example, smiths<BR>embellished the surfaces of a jewelry box, tea glass cases and sugar<BR>hammer (used to break up prices of sugar) with metal studs favored by<BR>Moors, while they engraved geometric patterns admired by the Tuareg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the works--such as the Cross of In Gall pendants worn by<BR>Tuareg girls and women-- are made principally of silver, which is<BR>associated with clairity, goodness and divine blessing. Some of the<BR>most visually complex objects are ceremonial arms in which smiths<BR>combined different metals. They embellished the hilts and blades with<BR>encrustations, incised motifs, and layers of variously colored<BR>metals. The leather scabbards that hold the arms reveal several<BR>leatherwork and metalwork techniques. The results are aesthetically<BR>compelling objects displaying striking contrasts of colors and<BR>materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the objects in the exhibition are from the museum's<BR>permanent collection, and all were probably produced within the past<BR>three decades. Many of the works were acquired by museum purchase and<BR>by gift of Mrs. Florence Selden in memory of Carl L. Selden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A free brochure by Tuareg specialist Kristyne Loughran will be<BR>available in the gallery. The publication provides additional<BR>information on the Tuareg and Moor cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Museum of African Art is open daily from 10 a.m. to<BR>5:30 p.m., except December 25. Admission is free. The museum's TTY<BR>number is (202) 357-4814.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNEBURG - South Africa is slowly but surely becoming a part of<BR>the African continent and he rest of the world.  Scores of local<BR>artists are participating in the Africa95 festival in which takes<BR>place in Britain for the whole month of September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Writer and cultural activist Mandla Langa, involved in<BR>coordinating the event's programme, described the participation of<BR>our artists as an historical breakthrough.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With the cultural boycott behind us our artists are gradually<BR>taking their rightful place beside other international artists, &quot; he<BR>said.  &quot;This event ushers my compatriots into a new era of selfLanga was part of a group of artists which met at the London's<BR>assertion and display of their talent.&quot;<BR>School of Oriental and African Studies in 1991 and initiated the<BR>concept of Africa95.  At that stage he was the then outlawed ANC's<BR>cultural attache in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africans featuring in Africa95 include Lucky Dube, Gcina<BR>Mhlope, David Kholoane, Sibongile Khumalo and Jackie Semela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charting and inspiring journey to the discovery of creative<BR>energy, beauty and complexity of the arts of Africa is the main theme<BR>of Africa95.  The event, the biggest of its kind, places the arts of<BR>Africa in the forefront of the world's artistic expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the visual arts, David Kholoane, who leads the South African<BR>contingent, is among seven curators from Senegal, Nigeria, Sudan, and<BR>Ethiopia, among others, mounting works which have a bearing on the<BR>history and experiences of their countries.  Kholoane highlights<BR>politicised South African art.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The all-male Manyanai Dancers from Cape Town present a repertoire<BR>of traditional and contemporary South African dances including<BR>pantsula and gumboot.  They share the limelight with dance groups<BR>from Zimbabwe, Nigeria, and Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A south African theatre production - Marabi by Malcolm Purky- is<BR>being staged in the same venue as The Beautification of Area Boy by<BR>Nigeria's Nobel Prize laureate, Wole Soyinka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Africa95 season also marks the emergence of new African<BR>writings.  Popular themes of violence, the crumbling of state<BR>institutions and exile in African literature are refurbished by South<BR>Africa's Gcina Mhlope and Abena Buisa from Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Langa, who leads the South African delegation of writers, will<BR>participate in discussions, seminars, and reading sessions with such<BR>notable writers as Chinua Achebe from Nigeria and Sembene Ousmane<BR>from Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This event puts to rest the legacy of decades of isolation during<BR>apartheid.  It also exposes our artists to international competition<BR>which is essential for their growth and maturity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Africa95 showcases our rich artistic talent.  But more than that<BR>it creates bridges between the African peoples, out of which we can<BR>all grow,&quot; Langa adds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>October 6, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FREETOWN - Military authorities in Sierra Leone say they have<BR>crushed an attempt to overthrow the government of Captain Valentine<BR>Strasser.  Seven soldiers have been arrested and detained following<BR>the abortive coup which happened on the night of October 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has given few details on how it happened.  The<BR>officers, whose names have yet to be disclosed include a major,<BR>lieutenants and captains.  It's the second coup attempt against<BR>Captain Strasser's government since it overthrew the civilian<BR>administration of former President Joseph Momoh in 1992.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports quote local observers as saying it is unlikely that the<BR>Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which has been fighting the<BR>government for the last four years was involved in the attempted<BR>take-over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the arrested officers, who are being detained at maximum<BR>security prisons in the capital, Freetown, are yet to be tried to<BR>determine their motive, officials have insinuated that some officers<BR>may be dissatisfied with the planned hand-over of power to democratic<BR>rule early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Captain Strasser has recently announced that he will hand over<BR>power to civilians after democratic elections have been held in<BR>February 1996, but few believe in successful polls against the<BR>background of the continuing rebel war which has killed thousands and<BR>displaced hundreds of thousands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Captain Strasser has kept Sierra Leoneans guessing about whether<BR>he intends to stand as a candidate in the forthcoming general<BR>elections as he has not stated his stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some analysts fear the failed plot could be an attempt by the<BR>military to maintain itself in power on grounds that it must end the<BR>war before handing the country back to civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They liken the latest development to tactics employed by the late<BR>military dictator Samuel Doe of neighbouring Liberia, where fake<BR>coups were the order of the day as a means of entrenching himself and<BR>maintaining a firm grip on power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reported failed coup in Sierra Leone comes amid renewed major<BR>offensive launched by the rebels since late September, in which four<BR>towns near the southern provincial capital Bo, have fallen to them<BR>for the first time in months.  In the latest fighting about 150<BR>people, including seven government soldiers, have been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foday Sankoh's RUF rebels are reported to have captured the towns<BR>of Kpetima, Yengema, Serabu and Walihun from government troops,<BR>backed by troops from Nigeria, Guinea and South African mercenaries.<BR>In the past the government has maintained that the rebels were<BR>launching hit- and-run tactics as they were unable to hold any town.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CAIRO - An unprecedented crowd packed Egypt's military court<BR>sitting at Huckstep on September 30 in support of 49 members of the<BR>Muslim Brotherhood on trial for underground activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 800 people, including 309 lawyers as well as<BR>representatives from professional unions, the Sunni Islam authority<BR>Al-Azhar, human rights groups and relatives of the accused came to<BR>back the brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judges also allowed the public to observe the proceedings, an<BR>unusual move for the military court in the Huckstep army base just<BR>north of Cairo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 49 Brotherhood members, who include several union figures,<BR>former members of parliament and an Azhar official, have been charged<BR>with &quot;directing an illegal organisation aiming to impede the rule of<BR>law and constitution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But controversy has focussed on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's<BR>decision to put them before a military tribunal, which started its<BR>sittings on September 16. The tribunal usually considers cases<BR>connected to Muslim militant unrest, even though none of the 49 are<BR>accused of planning &quot;terrorism&quot; or &quot;violence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four British barristers, including former Member of Parliament<BR>John Platts- Mills, who volunteered to help the defence team, also<BR>attended the weekend session and thanked the court for allowing them<BR>to observe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The defence team comprises almost 60 members from the entire<BR>political spectrum, including leftists and three Christian lawyers.<BR>They presented as evidence statements by Mubarak saying he would not<BR>implement emergency law in effect since 1981, which allow military<BR>trials of civilians except in cases of &quot;terrorism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also submitted a speech by Brotherhood leader Mamun Hodeibi<BR>before parliament in 1994 in which he supported a third term for<BR>Mubarak as president as evidence that the group was not working<BR>against the state. The defence further asked the court to delay<BR>proceedings until after a court of appeal court rules on a suit to<BR>reverse Mubarak's order for a military trial. The appeals court will<BR>make its ruling on October 24</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1994 Mubarak accused the Muslim Brotherhood of being behind<BR>attacks by Islamic militants in Egypt. Brotherhood leaders &quot;regulate<BR>the activity of the group's youth and forbid them to resort to<BR>violence or destruction so that the situation does not reach a crisis<BR>as it has in Afghanistan and Algeria,&quot; the group's London spokesman<BR>Kamal al-Halabawi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Halabawi was quoted by the Arab daily Ash-Sharo Al-Awsat as<BR>denying on September 30 that the Brotherhood backed violence, saying<BR>it had actually saved Egypt from becoming another Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Brotherhood, which was founded in 1929 and officially banned<BR>since 1954 says the arrests of dozens of its members is aimed to<BR>sabotage its chances in parliamentary elections set for November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile two other Islamic militant groups, the Jihad and Jamaa<BR>Islamiyya, have called on the Brotherhood to join in the bloody<BR>struggle against Mubarak's secular government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bloody campaign by fundamentalists from the two militant<BR>groups against government security forces has already left some 884<BR>people dead since it started in March 1992.</SPAN></P>

The fourth accused, James Maigua,<BR>Koigi's brother-in-law was acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the verdict was received with open criticism by a cross<BR>section of the Kenyan society particularly the Law Society of Kenya<BR>(LSK) and some diplomatic missions among others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US Ambassador to Kenya Aurelia Brazeal advised the three to appeal<BR>against the sentence. At an official function in Western Kenya, she<BR>said; &quot;I advise Koigi and his colleagues to appeal to the next court<BR>against the sentence for fair trial.&quot; Opposition Member of Parliament<BR>Paul Muite, former leading defence lawyer in what has come to be<BR>dubbed &quot;The Koigi Four&quot; case urged all foreign missions in Kenya to<BR>strive and save the accused from suffering corporal punishment.<BR>Amnesty International called for the immediate and unconditional<BR>release of the three whom they said are 'prisoners of conscience&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were emotional scenes and anger in the courtroom after the<BR>verdict here, some 140 kilometres north- west of the capital Nairobi.<BR>Koigi's elderly mother, Monica Wangu, broke down sobbing<BR>uncontrollably and challenged the magistrate: &quot;Have you no children<BR>of your own? What have my sons done that you must persecute them for<BR>a lifetime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She also declared that she would not bury her husband's body that<BR>was still lying in the municipal mortuary in Nakuru more than one<BR>year after he died aged 85. At the time of his death, she said she<BR>would await the outcome of the trial in the expectation that her two<BR>sons would be set free and they could then bury their father as per<BR>their Kikuyu tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;Koigi Four&quot; case attracted a great deal of international<BR>attention because Koigi is a long term opposition activist who had<BR>been detained several times over the last twenty years. Well known<BR>international human rights groups like the John F. Kennedy Memorial<BR>Center cast aspersions on the competence and neutrality of the court<BR>in what they saw as a political inquisition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Koigi lived in exile in Norway between 1986-1990 where his wife<BR>and children are now naturalised citizens. Norway and Scandinavian<BR>counties have been particularly concerned about his fate and torment<BR>in prison. Norway's Charge d'Affaires, Christian Danbolt, emerged<BR>hurriedly from the court saying he was quite unhappy with the<BR>verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the trial the prosecution alleged that Koigi, a former<BR>Member of Parliament for Nakuru, with his co- accused and others not<BR>before the court raided Bahati Police Station in Nakuru, on the night<BR>of November 2, 1993 armed with a home made gun. They allegedly sought<BR>to seize guns in the police armoury. Three raiders were shot dead<BR>according to police accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But defence lawyer Paul Muite, who called the verdict &quot;a travesty<BR>of justice&quot;, his co-lawyers Mirugi Kariuki and Orlaly Cheche say<BR>police witnesses had perjured themselves. They however did not offer<BR>final oral submissions because the magistrate had demanded a written<BR>submission saying he was taking the step to stop the lawyers making<BR>political capital in court. Defence insisted he was trying to hide<BR>the facts from the world. Koigi himself insisted earlier that Tuiyot<BR>&quot;had already convicted us&quot;. He was only going through the mechanics<BR>of the trial process, said the Charismatic 46 year old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four accused persons were not in court when the magistrate<BR>returned his verdict. Tuiyot said he did not want a further verbal<BR>exchange with them. However, the three managed to smuggle out of<BR>prison a letter through the acquitted individual maintaining their<BR>innocence. They said they would not mitigate for themselves as doing<BR>so would be tantamount to pleading for mercy, &quot;we have no guilt to<BR>atone for,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They asserted that the case was that of &quot;political and ethnic<BR>persecution&quot;. They said the case had been downgraded from robbery<BR>with violence to simple robbery which carries a mandatory death<BR>sentence to placate international donors but the verdict was an abuse<BR>of their civil liberties. &quot;In the struggle for justice and freedom<BR>nothing is so dear to sacrifice - not personal comforts, not jobs,<BR>not even life,&quot; said the letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood Koigi who wore dreadlocks which he insisted he<BR>would not shave until Moi was no longer in power, was immediately<BR>shaved by warders after the verdict. Mrs. Jacqueline Ngengi, wife of<BR>G.G. Ngengi Muigai, one of the convicted said &quot;the state has<BR>fulfilled what it planned long before they were even arrested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> James Orengo, a lawyer and deputy vice-chairman of the opposition<BR>Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD)-Kenya party called the<BR>case &quot;a sham&quot;. Kenneth Matiba of the Ford-Asili (Original) party said<BR>the case &quot;was a shame for the Kenya judicial system&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It recently emerged that Koigi was one of the founder members of<BR>the new opposition party called Safina, (Kiswahili for &quot;the Ark,&quot;)<BR>that the government is yet to register. Among its founders is Dr.<BR>Richard Leakey whom president Moi has attacked relentlessly over the<BR>last few months calling him a colonialist.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALGIERS - The editor-in-chief of El-Khabar, one of Algeria's top<BR>Arabic-language dailies, was shot dead on October 3 in an apparent<BR>continuation of a campaign against press opposition by suspected<BR>Islamic fundamentalists, Algerian security officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omar Ouartilan, 36, was shot dead in the head with five bullets<BR>near his newspaper offices in the working class neighbourhood of<BR>Belcourt, near the city centre, the officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police could not immediately say who had carried out the killing,<BR>but suspicion rested on the Muslim fundamentalist groups who have<BR>since May 1993 killed 42 journalists criticised for opposing the<BR>fundamentalist insurgency ravaging the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Security officials said the El-Khabar editor was shot by a young<BR>man, 200 metres from his daily's building inside former army barracks<BR>where several other newspapers have also made their home. The site is<BR>patrolled by police and protected by barbed wire and metal detectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interior Minister Mostafa Benmansour condemned the &quot;cowardly<BR>attack&quot; by the &quot;forces of darkness&quot;, six weeks ahead of a<BR>presidential elections due on November 16.The elections have been<BR>opposed by most of the mainstream and more hardline opposition<BR>groups, while the fundamentalists have vowed to disrupt them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the motive for the killing is confirmed, Ouartilan would be the<BR>43rd journalist to be killed in the campaign, and the 19th this year.<BR>He had been editor-in-chief of El-Khabar since 1991. The newspaper<BR>publisher escaped an assassination attempt in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last article by Ouartilan to be published in the paper was a<BR>commentary whose headline read: &quot;Oh peace, show yourself&quot;. Starting<BR>with a verse from the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwiche, it spoke of<BR>the despair of the average citizen, caught between the violence of<BR>the fundamentalists on one side and the military-backed government on<BR>the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 30,000 people are reported to have died so far in nearly<BR>four years of civil war in Algeria. The fighting was sparked off by<BR>the government's cancellation of the second round of January 1992<BR>elections whose winner appeared to be the fundamentalist party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 150 journalists have fled Algeria to go overseas, most<BR>of them taking refuge in the former colonial power, France. Some<BR>journalists now move around armed, refusing to stay in the same place<BR>overnight for more than a few days at a time and changing their<BR>appearance frequently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Ouartilan refused to live in buildings protected by the<BR>security forces, only recently leaving his home in the Bab el Oued<BR>district because it was judged &quot;Unsafe&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUJUMBURA - Unidentified attackers assassinated two Italian<BR>priests and an elderly Italian lay worker on the night of September<BR>30 in a remote area of southern Burundi, UN Special Representative in<BR>Burundi Ahmedou Abdallah announced on October 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two priests, who were in their 50s or 60s, and the lay worker,<BR>who was in her 70s, were killed in the province of Bururi, Abdallah<BR>said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The priests belonged to the Xavieriani Order of the Roman Catholic<BR>Church and had been in Burundi for many years, but the lay worker had<BR>only arrived in the country recently, Abdallah said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Describing the killings as &quot;just not despicable, but abominable&quot;,<BR>Abdalla said that he was concerned by what appeared to be a campaign<BR>against the Roman Catholic Church in some Burundian newspapers which<BR>included &quot;often unfounded accusations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abdallah appealed to Burundians to respect religion saying: &quot;As a<BR>Muslim, that is important to me.&quot; The motive for the killings was not<BR>immediately clear, but observers said that with ethnic killings<BR>common in this tiny central African nation, it was possible the<BR>Italians had witnessed an atrocity and had been killed to prevent<BR>them from talking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two Burundian priests have also been assassinated in the past one<BR>month, Abdallah added. A Catholic priest was also gunned down and<BR>killed on August 21 after celebrating mass in his parish in Ngaraga.<BR>The assassination followed a series of bloody attacks that had rocked<BR>the tiny central African nation in the previous two weeks that left<BR>more than 50 people dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic church was under continuous attack in the mid-1980s<BR>when Jean- Batiste Bagaza was president. Bagaza, who was considered a<BR>Tutsi extremist, remains in Bujumbura since he returned from exile in<BR>Uganda a few years ago and has a considerable following.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest killings came amid further reports of violence in<BR>Burundi in which nearly 30 people were said to have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A report by the Burundi press agency on September 30 quoted<BR>eyewitnesses as saying that 24 people were massacred by armed Hutu<BR>gangs in eastern Burundi on September 28, while at least four were<BR>killed in separate violence overnight in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 24 died in Buygigi province in attacks by gangs who also stole<BR>a large amount of money. Three of the attackers were killed by<BR>security forces, the agency said, but did not confirm whether<BR>civilians were among the dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citing informed sources, Radio Burundi also reported frequent<BR>automatic fire and at least two grenade explosions in the Ngaraga<BR>district north of the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said an armed gang threw the grenades and caused slight<BR>injuries to four children in an attack on a camp for displaced Tutsis<BR>in Ngaraga, as shots were also being heard in other areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The radio also revealed that a man suspected of being a gang<BR>leader was killed in Cibitoke, north of Ngaraga, in as yet unclear<BR>circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi has the same ethnic mix of 85 per cent Hutu and 14 per<BR>cent Tutsi as Rwanda before the civil war, when between half a<BR>million and one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were massacred by<BR>the Hutu- dominated army and militia before its overthrow in July<BR>last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Burundi, President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya is a Hutu, but the<BR>Tutsis hold most of the key positions, especially in the security<BR>forces, and the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - A splinter group from the local Presbyterian Church of<BR>East Africa (PCEA) has announced the formation of a new church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Led by outspoken clergy and former editor of a church and later<BR>his own private magazine, Rev. Jamlick Miano of Kirimara Presbytery<BR>in Central Province, some 30 clergy announced October 1st that they<BR>were launching a new church to be known as the Presbyterian<BR>Evangelical Church of Africa (PECA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Moderator of the PCEA General Assembly Rt. Rev. Bernard<BR>Muindi denounced the group saying the PCEA would not allow the<BR>registration of their splinter church using the word &quot;Presbyterian&quot;,<BR>as when the alphabets ...PECA.. are re-arranged, the abbreviation<BR>comes to those for the Presbyterian Church of East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement to APS dated October 3, the PCEA Moderator said the<BR>church did not regret that the group led by Rev. Jamlick Miano and<BR>John Wandimi Wang'ombe had formed a splinter church.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Criticizing the two leaders of the splinter church group, Rev.<BR>Muindi warned their followers to be aware that the two men have<BR>morally failed in their former church work as pastors and &quot;are hungry<BR>for leadership&quot;. The PCEA is looking forward to see what sort of<BR>leadership they are going to provide to their followers,&quot; added<BR>Muindi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to questions posed earlier by APS following the<BR>announcement of the formation of the splinter group, Rev. Muindi<BR>noted that ambition for leadership and money were the two main causes<BR>for splits in the churches today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He described the two vices as great enemies in today's church<BR>adding, &quot;if the Church has to be the Church, these evils must be<BR>fought against vehemently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PCEA Moderator noted that people of the calibre of Miano and<BR>Wang'ombe had marred the image of the church, and instead of saying<BR>that the PCEA should be reformed and that it is corrupt, they should<BR>be praying that they be reformed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of John Wandimi Wang'ombe, Rev. Muindi noted that the former was<BR>deposed from the church's ministry because of misconduct, as a result<BR>of which he lost his status as clergy and as such had no right to use<BR>the title &quot;Reverend&quot; or &quot;Pastor&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About Miano, the PCEA Moderator noted that the former editor<BR>resigned when he learnt that disciplinary measure were being taken<BR>against him because of misconduct as well as failure to do his<BR>duties. &quot;He has been a controversial pastor, but the PCEA has been<BR>nursing him sympathetically in an effort to see whether he could<BR>reform, but all in vain,&quot; added the Moderator. He added that instead<BR>of deposing him immediately, the PCEA transferred him to Kirimara<BR>Presbytery to work as a chaplain at the nearby Karatina hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miano, a former editor of his own private magazine &quot;Watchman&quot;, now<BR>outlawed and the defunct Jitegemea (Kiswahili translation for selfabout 30 others including Wang'ombe, announced the formation of the<BR>reliance), which was a quarterly mouthpiece of the PCEA together with<BR>Presbyterian Evangelical Church of Africa during an open air crusade<BR>in Karatina town, in central province, some 100 kilometres north-east<BR>of here. Eight priests were commissioned to serve in the synod which<BR>would be headed by Miano in his capacity as Canon-General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miano edited Jitegemea from 1991 to 1993. The monthly PCEA<BR>magazine began in 1985 and was then edited by Rev. John Mburu. It<BR>closed down in 1990 but was re-launched in 1991 under Miano.<BR>Jitegemea's editorial contents which were clearly critical of the<BR>government did not escape the authorities' pressure, forcing it to<BR>fold up early 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PCEA which was introduced in Kenya by seven Sctottish<BR>Missionaries in 1891 also runs two theological colleges. The church<BR>began as the Presbytery of East Africa, then became the Overseas<BR>Presbytery before it attained its current status in the late 1950s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miano had earlier announced that he was quiting the PCEA citing<BR>frustrations, tribalism, corruption and high- handedness in the<BR>church. By the time of going to press, efforts to get a comment from<BR>Rev. Miano were futile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, about 50 PCEA faithful were reported to have raided<BR>Miano's house on the evening of October 1, 1995, threatening to throw<BR>him out. The group wanted to know why he was staying in the house<BR>when he had quit the church. He is reported to have said that he<BR>would continue staying in the church house until the church pays his<BR>retirement dues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Rev. Miano and his group succeed in registering a new church as<BR>indicated, then this would be the first split reported in the 104<BR>year-old history of the Presbyteraian Church of East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PCEA is affiliated to the continental Nairobi-based All Africa<BR>Conference of Churches (AACC), the global World Association for<BR>Christian Communication (WACC), the World Alliance of Reformed<BR>Churches (WARC), the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the local<BR>National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK). It is the third largest<BR>denomination in Kenya with 1.5 million faithful. The Catholics and<BR>Anglicans have over 6 million and 3 million followers respectively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)<BR>October 10, 1995<BR>by Mukalya Nampito and Goliath Mungonge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Fresh evidence of debtors of the liquidated Meridien Bank<BR>has revealed howsenior government and leaders of the ruling party,<BR>the MMD, could have benefitted from the demise of the bank they owed<BR>cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The leaders include defence minister Ben Mwila, whose company,<BR>Investment Holdings, had a loan of more than K147 million which bank<BR>sources say was suspiciously secured. Transport minister Dawson<BR>Lupunga and MMD's Moped are among other debtors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwila offered a guarrantee of K50 million and his house in Kitwe<BR>together with one of his firms in Luanshya despite having resigned as<BR>director of the named firm in April 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Guarantee by B.Y. Mwila for K50m plus interest; First legal<BR>mortgage for K3m plus interest over S/D1092, Kitwe; Equitable<BR>mortgage over stand No. 1091, Luanshya in the name of Gilmer<BR>Engineering Limited,&quot; read the Bank of Zambia listing of non<BR>performing credits by customer as at January 31, 1995.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A search at the company registry office, however, shows that Mwila<BR>resigned his directorship of Investment Holdings on April 29, 1994<BR>but was immediately apppointed on the company's Board, according to<BR>minutes found there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwila's company was first registered with the registrar of<BR>companies on April 28, 1975 with a nominal capital of K2,500,000.<BR>Mwila did not reply to two press queries, one sent to his Chudleigh<BR>house and the other through Jack Mubanga, the defense secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mr. Mwila has dashed out of the country for an urgent assignment,<BR>so your query can wait,&quot; the reporter was told at the defence<BR>ministry. Transport minister Dawson Lupunga offered himself as<BR>security together with his farm in Ndola for a loan of K161 million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Ugandans may watch probably the best netball in recent<BR>decades as Kampala hosts the East, Central and Southern Africa<BR>Netball Senior Championships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> World Cup netball finalist and All Africa Games Netball champions,<BR>South Africa have confirmed they are coming. So are Malawi, Zambia,<BR>Namibia and debutantes Zimbabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No word yet from neighbours Zanzibar and Tanzania, but reports<BR>from Kenya say the Kenya national side, &quot;Nyayo Stars&quot;, are already in<BR>non-residential training at Nyayo Stadium readying themselves to<BR>defend the trophy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have received a good response from NCS, our next step is to<BR>fix the dates,&quot; said Lydia Bukenya, the Uganda Netball Federation<BR>boss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda last hosted a major netball event in 1982. It was until<BR>other member countries threatened to throw Uganda out of the<BR>Confederation unless they also hosted that they realised they too<BR>have to do something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still all is not well as the Uganda Netball Federation is cash<BR>strapped and are desperately looking for a sponsor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We only received the green light to host the championships from<BR>NCS, but we have no funds. Therefore we have to fund-raise in order<BR>to host this tournament,&quot; said Lydia Bukenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda and Kenya have dominated this event since its inception<BR>over a decade ago, but with the inclusion of South Africa and the<BR>rapid growth of netball in Malawi and Zambia, the trophy may go down<BR>south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rose Kaala UNF General Secretary said that Uganda will be<BR>represented by two teams, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. &quot;We are about to summon the<BR>players, but before that we have to play a regional and &quot;She Cranes&quot;<BR>tournaments to select the best girls,&quot; she explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Kaala, the event is slated for December after the<BR>East and Central Senior Challenge Cup in November.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - UNIP has called for an end to the use of voter<BR>certificates during elections charging that the method has been used<BR>and abused by the ruling MMD to rig elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charges come shortly after UNIP lost three of the five<BR>parliamentary by-elections held on Tuesday this week which were<BR>characterised by physical clashes over voters' certificates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have established beyond any reasonable doubt that the MMD are<BR>rigging all the elections they have won so far and the process they<BR>are using is that of issuing excess and fake voter's certificates, &quot;<BR>said UNIP administrative secretary Basil Kabwe in an interview on<BR>Wednesday this week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP lost the Kabompo West seat to MMD's Mathew Makayi, the<BR>Bweengwa seat to Nalukombo Keembe and Lufwanyama was scooped by MMD's<BR>Mike Mlongoti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP has retained the Musanzala and Lundazi seats through their<BR>candidates James Mwale and Bina Moyo respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Musanzala seat however the electoral office had to suspend<BR>the use of voter's certificates after it found evidence of massive<BR>reproduction of voter's certificates by an electoral officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But MMD member and presidential press aide Richard Sakala<BR>dispelled Kabwe'scharges as groundless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We lost in Lundazi and Musanzala, this could not have been the<BR>case had we been issuing fake voters certificates as claimed, so the<BR>accusation is really baseless, &quot; Sakala said in a telephone interview<BR>on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He condemned the violence in Lundazi which he charged was being<BR>perpetrated by unruly UNIP cadres: &quot;there was lots of violence there<BR>were police and innocent MMD members were injured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kabwe however feels MMD had a share in the much publicised<BR>election violence &quot;These are issues that are real but the<BR>government media has chosen to turn a blind eye to them choosing to<BR>report on the so-called UNIP violence which is instigated by MMD<BR>members, &quot; Kabwe said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)<BR>October 10, 1995<BR>by Catherine Mwewa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zanzibar - Post newspaper managing director and editor in chief,<BR>Fred M'membe has scooped this year's Media Institute of Southern<BR>Africa (MISA) press freedom award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The award which was presented to him by human rights lawyer Roger<BR>Chongwe on Saturday night in the Indian Ocean Island is in<BR>recognition for his significant contribution to media freedom in<BR>Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MISA board of trustees chairman, Justice John Manyarara from<BR>Zimbabwe explained that the objective of the prize was to award<BR>excellence in journalism. Justice Manyarara described excellence in<BR>journalism as &quot;the upholding professional ethics at all costs and the<BR>relentless pursuit of truth behind the bare facts.&quot; He said M'membe<BR>had showed &quot;courage, depth and foresightedness in his reportage hence<BR>the reason he was nominated for the award.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presenting the award, Chongwe hailed M'membe for his relentless<BR>fight against corruption and drug trafficking together with<BR>dictatorship. M'membe said:&quot;this award is not for Fred M'membe alone<BR>but it belongs to all those who have contributed to the production of<BR>and survival of The Post.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M'membe thanked the Zambian people for their continued support of<BR>The Post through sales and Misa for honouring the independent bia lonely profession but interesting at times. There are times when<BR>weekly. &quot;It is a great sign of solidarity with us. Journalism can be<BR>people we write for disown us. When they ignore the malpractices, the<BR>acts of corruption because they are carried out by people they<BR>support&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said even fascists and dictators too have received support from<BR>their people citing Adolf Hitler and Idi Amin as some of those who<BR>were backed in their dictatorial governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MISA governor for the Zambia chapter, and Editor in chief of the<BR>National Mirror, Fanwell Chembo could not hide his admiration and<BR>respect for M'membe. &quot;It has been a hard road to freedom for us<BR>journalists, truth, perseverance and determination to get to the root<BR>cause of the story are the whole marks of good journalism. &quot;These<BR>qualities have been exhibited by Fred and his team at the Post.&quot; He<BR>said only after four years of practising journalism, M'membe has<BR>excelled above the &quot;so called experienced people in the field of<BR>journalism. &quot;He has brought a new brand of journalism to Zambia. It<BR>is no secret that alot of emerging papers have are there because of<BR>the leadership Fred has provided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elia Cossa, editor of Demos Weekly in Maputo, Mozambique said it<BR>was a fair award to Fred and his team. &quot;It is a very good example of<BR>what the role of journalists and the press in our region has<BR>contributed to democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ngozi Awa, chief executive of Colcla Group International and a<BR>MISA consultant appealed to leaders to bear in mind that they were<BR>empowered because of free press. Thus should not silence journalists<BR>like Fred but encourage and support and defend freedom of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year's MISA Freedom of the Press award was Basildon Peta, a<BR>Zimbabwean journalist who was courageous enough to refuse to divulge<BR>sources in the face of harassment from the state</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MISA is a dynamic member driven network of regional chapters which<BR>seeks through training, monitoring, capacity building, research and<BR>the distribution of information to foster free, independent and<BR>diverse media throughout southern Africa. Member countries include<BR>Namibia, Tanzania, Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,<BR>South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - LARGER Gran Borer (LGB) has invaded Zambia's maize<BR>imports at the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salam. Director of Zambia<BR>National Farmers Union, George Grey, revealed in an interview on<BR>Tuesday that LGB invasion was discovered in a 2000 tonne consignment<BR>of maize for the government's strategic reserves from Dar-es-Salam<BR>last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have already informed the government of the LGB situation and<BR>plans to start fumigating at Kapiri Mposhi are underway. The only way<BR>we can contain the situation is to put stringent measures like<BR>fumigating all maize wagons entering the country,&quot; Grey said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initially, the wagons were supposed to be inspected on entry into<BR>the country through Nakonde border post but this was however ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grey added that there were fears of a widespread attack by the<BR>beetles especially that the consignment was derailed in Mkushi, the<BR>largest maize farming area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our fears are that this may affect the grain production in<BR>Mkushi. The pest multiplies very quickly and it poses a serious<BR>threat ,&quot; Grey disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This development may worsen the grain situation which already<BR>stands at a deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both the farmers union and government have repeatedly warned of a<BR>sever food shortage to be caused mainly by drought. Government urged<BR>the public to begin conserving adequate domestic food reserves and<BR>avoid food wastage in their daily living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agriculture permanent secretary, Austin Sichinga has also<BR>confirmed the LGB invasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is not only the LGB but also other grain pests. The maize that<BR>came in from Tanzania was contaminated and is currently quarantined<BR>at Kapiri Mposhi. The maize was supposed to be inspected by our<BR>counterparts in Tanzania before the shipment was released,&quot; Sichinga<BR>said, adding: &quot;The grain is awaiting fumigation and only the grain<BR>certified as fit for consumption will be released to avoid the spread<BR>of the pest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grey however warned that the country was on the brink of a<BR>critical maize shortage if the grain was not imported in four weeks<BR>time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need importation in the next four weeks if we are to avoid an<BR>acute shortage,&quot; Grey said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Farmers have added their voice to the ongoing claims of<BR>rampant corruption in the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The farmers have also warned that Presidsent Chiluba will be<BR>blamed for any loss of donor support because he has continued to be<BR>ineffective in dealing with cases of corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The allegations (ZCCM) are very serious especially considering<BR>that ZCCM is Zambia's economic life blood and is a public<BR>institution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our Republican President continues to ask for evidence- yet he<BR>has at his disposal not only the power-but the mechanism to get to<BR>the bottom of the problem,&quot; said a statement issued in Lusaka this<BR>week by Zambia National farmers Union (ZNFU) chairman Ben Kapita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He charged the Presidents's apperent tolerance of corruption does<BR>not justify the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation which<BR>Chiluba hastily made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The farmer's reaction follows a story earlier carried in The Post<BR>edition of October 6 saying donors have complained of corruption and<BR>abuse of office in the conduct of the affairs of ZCCM. The donors<BR>also warned that before the mines company can be privatised the<BR>corruption will have to be stamped out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the allegations by the donors expressed at the consultative<BR>meeting are not investigated and if corrective action is not taken,<BR>then Zambians will conclude that the government has something to hide<BR>or is protecting some untouchable leaders,&quot; Kapita said and added:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If this leads to a reduction in donor confidence in the<BR>credibility of our leadership and therefore a reduction in donor<BR>support for Zambia, then the President must be held responsible or<BR>the loss of support,&quot; the release read in part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kapita retaliated on Wednesday this week that he stood by the<BR>farmers statement but a government minister declined to discuss the<BR>matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have no comment on that matter of corruption,&quot; said deputy<BR>minister Works and Supply, Celestino Chibamba in a telephone<BR>interview on the same day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The government is struggling to regain access to the<BR>International Monetary Fund (IMF) after failing to complete the<BR>Rights Accumulation Programme last May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A rights accumulation programme (RAP) allows a country in<BR>protracted arrears to regain membership of the Fund through a phased<BR>repayment schedule until amounts reach the level of arrears<BR>outstanding at the beginning of the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the start of the RAP, Zambia's arrears stood at SDR833<BR>million (SDR: Special Drawing Rights).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's re-admittance to the fund depends on the completion of<BR>this programme which was postponed to September when Zambia was deBank.<BR>railed off the repayment schedule by the attempted rescue of Meridien</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, government has still failed to meet the deadline despite<BR>numerous easures put in place to boost government revenue especially<BR>through the tax system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IMF representative to Zambia Eluualeed Taha could not shed more<BR>light on the issue this week as he was reportedly attending meetings<BR>between the government and the IMF mission which are currently going<BR>on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a 1995 IMF annual report confirmed that: As of April 30, 1995,<BR>Zambia had accumulated rights of SDR 647 million, under a rights<BR>accumulation programme approved by the executive board in 1992. In<BR>March 1995 the board extended the expiration date of the programme<BR>from March 31 to May 31 to provide more time for Zambia to accumulate<BR>the remaining million and to continue discussions on a successor<BR>Enhanced Structural Adjustment Fund (ESAF).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the IMF mission last month failed to reveal any<BR>developments. Sources at the Ministry of Finance said that Zambia<BR>failed to meet its benchmarks or contribute enough towards the<BR>programme in August and September and the government will remain in a<BR>tight cash squeeze if it is to meet the November and December<BR>benchmarks to finish the programme by December 1995 or early next<BR>year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy Minister of Finance Koshita Shengamo said last week that<BR>government was committed to the completion of the programme and were<BR>on course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I do not think there is anything that will upset us,&quot; he said in<BR>an interview on Monday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington - With presidential elections scheduled for Sunday,<BR>October 22, in the Ivory Coast (Cote d'Ivoire), all major opposition<BR>parties are boycotting the poll in protest and say they will also<BR>boycott the parliamentary elections next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reelection of Henri Konan President Bedie, successor after<BR>long-term President Houphouet-Boigny two years ago, is assured. In<BR>addition to the lack of an independent electoral commission, the<BR>center point of opposition protest is the electoral code, which<BR>alters the previous practice of allowing African residents of noncode also excluded from candidacy a leading rival for the Presidency,<BR>Ivorian origin (an estimated 40% of the population) to vote. The<BR>former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara. Ouattara's father was born<BR>in Burkina Faso, and he has been resident outside the country since<BR>1994, as Deputy Director of the International Monetary Fund in<BR>Washington, both bars against candidacy in the new electoral code.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following documents include an open letter from opposition<BR>representatives in Washington, and an earlier evaluation, by the<BR>Washington-bsed election monitoring group International Foundation<BR>for Electoral Systems, of the electoral code revision process. The<BR>documents are distributed by the Africa Policy Information Center<BR>110 Maryland Ave. NE, Washington, DC 20002. Phone: 202-546-7961. Fax:<BR>202-546-1545. Email: apic@igc.apc.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Open Letter from Front Populaire Ivoirien and Rassemblement des<BR>Republicains, September 15, 1995 General elections in Ivory Coast<BR>are scheduled for the last quarter of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In December 1994, however, President Henry Konan Bedie, appointed<BR>one year earlier to complete the term of the deceased President<BR>Houphouet-Boigny until the 1995 elections, approved a new electoral<BR>code. This code, under the cover of the fuzzy concept of &quot;Ivoirite,&quot;<BR>is aimed at destroying the multi-ethnic social fabric of the Ivorian<BR>nation. If nothing is done immediately to minimize the impact of this<BR>devastating electoral code, the foreseeable consequences will be<BR>extremely dangerous for the survival of this multi-ethnic West<BR>African nation of 14 million inhabitants with 4 million Africans of<BR>non- Ivorian origin. Although only a few African scholars,<BR>particularly Ivorian scholars, have stood up vigorously against this<BR>electoral law, Ivorian religious leaders both Christian and Muslim,<BR>have asked the Bedie government to revise the text to remove the<BR>openly exclusive and xenophobic tone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The electoral code, written by the PDCI (the Democratic Party of<BR>the Ivory Coast), the party in power, with the approval of President<BR>Bedie, is discriminatory against some Ivorians. Its principal<BR>objective is to sow discord and to spread hate among the different<BR>ethnic groups that make up the nation. The code fosters unfairness<BR>against some targeted ethnic groups (the Abbey, the Agni, the Bete,<BR>the Dioula), who are considered to be dangerous because they could<BR>play a crucial role in countering Mr. Bedie's bid to capture the<BR>highest political power in Ivory Coast for the next five years. If<BR>enforced, this law would destroy--for the sake of winning a<BR>presidential bid--a thirty- year-old history of construction of the<BR>Ivorian nation that has made the Ivory Coast a genuine model of<BR>integration in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, all West African nations have a fairly important community<BR>of their own peoples married or living as immigrants in Ivory Coast<BR>and this is unique on the African continent. President Bedie has<BR>bluntly stated that his electoral code was to remain, despite urgent<BR>requests from Ivorian religious dignitaries, from opposition<BR>leadership and from the majority of the Ivorian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the adamant refusal by President Bedie and the PDCI to agree<BR>upon a bipartisan agenda -- i.e. an amendment to the electoral code<BR>and agreement on a fully independent electoral commission, the<BR>Republican Front, a coalition of the seven major opposition parties,<BR>decided upon a course of actions to bring the Bedie administration<BR>to the negotiations table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in response, the Bedie administration banned for a period of<BR>three months &quot;all marches and sit-ins in all streets and public<BR>squares.&quot; This means that the wrestling match between the PDCI and<BR>other legal political powers is now underway.  This may lead to<BR>bloodshed, because the Ivorian forces of change are determined not to<BR>allow the massive electoral frauds of 1990 go unchecked this election<BR>year. Therefore, if nothing is done immediately, we will be making<BR>our way towards an almost certain social explosion in the months<BR>ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The specter of Liberia, a neighboring country which might have<BR>been saved from the presen human tragedy if one had acted in time,<BR>can only haunt the spirits of all those who love the Ivory Coast and<BR>who wish it to avoid the all too- common fate of civil war. That is<BR>why we would like to call on the great democratic institution of the<BR>American Congress and the Clinton Administration to help Mr. Bedie<BR>understand that his electoral code in its current form and the<BR>rejection of a fully independent electoral committee are a total<BR>denial of the rule of law for free and open elections. This is<BR>contrary to what the Ivory Coast authorities agreed in finally<BR>welcoming a multi-party system of governance in May 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The general elections scheduled for October 22 should be postponed<BR>for six months. The delay would allow the Government and the<BR>Opposition to work out together an electoral system fair to both.<BR>The entire Ivorian population will support the electoral lists that<BR>came out of the last census only if Opposition parties participate<BR>in setting up a genuine independent national electoral commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On behalf of the Ivorian Popular Front: Pascal D. Kokora, Ph.D.<BR>On behalf of the Republican Rally, Balla Sidibe. c/o P.O. Box 18110,<BR>Washington, DC 20036.  Fax: (202) 234-6074.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Excerpts from election planning report of the International<BR>Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) (Elections Today, May 1995,<BR>pp. 23, 25) IFES, 1101 15th St. NW, 3rd Fl., Washington, DC 20005.<BR>Tel: (202) 828-8507; Fax: (202) 452-0804. IFES sent a four-person<BR>technical team to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire from Oct. 19 to Nov. 4,<BR>1994. The team's primary objective was the review of the ongoing<BR>voters registry revision in preparation for national elections<BR>scheduled for 1995.<BR>... After 35 years of national independence, the 1995 national<BR>elections will be only the second to encourage open, multi- party<BR>competition. President Houphouet-Boigny's passing signaled the<BR>beginning of a new era for the nation, as well as for the sub-region<BR>and the entire African continent. One important indicator the change<BR>in Cote d'Ivoire is the ongoing revision and verification of the<BR>electoral list, and the related debate over the continued extension<BR>of the franchise to non-Ivorians. ... After lengthy debate, it was<BR>decided that for the first time in recent elections, non-Ivorians<BR>resident in Cote d'Ivoire will not be allowed to vote in the national<BR>elections.<BR>... The team's primary concern with the process centered on four<BR>areas: *A lack of openness among the government officials controlling<BR>the process.<BR>* Based on the findings of the IFES team and on the information<BR>provided by the government, the team concluded that, if the<BR>government has nothing to hide, they must improve the quality of the<BR>information that they disseminate to the public. ... *A lack of<BR>proactive participation in the revision process by opposition<BR>political parties and non-partisan civic and human rights groups.<BR>* ...  Inaction favors the party in power and the current<BR>administration, permitting them to be accountable to no one.<BR>* A seamless relationship between the government of the Cote<BR>d'Ivoire and the leading political party, the Partie Democratique de<BR>Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI-RDA).<BR>* ... The IFES team feels that a major challenge facing the<BR>Ivorian election administration is the successful balancing of the<BR>intentions of the party in power and the equal participation of the<BR>other political parties and candidates.<BR>* A need for timely publishing of complete instructions for each<BR>step of the registration and the electoral processes to define the<BR>vague procedural and legal guidelines set out in the electoral code.<BR>* ... The electoral code as it stands can be said to create more<BR>questions than it resolves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFES' experience in electoral reform and technical elections<BR>assistance in many of Cote d'Ivoire's neighboring nations underlined<BR>for the Foundation the importance of the 1995 elections, not only<BR>for Cote d'Ivoire, but for the entire sub- region. The transformation<BR>to participatory multi-partyism in many of the neighboring countries,<BR>including Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Guinea, the Gambia, and<BR>Senegal, will only benefit from the conduct of open and transparent<BR>elections in Cote d'Ivoire.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>October 20, 1995<BR>by Meshack Mabogoane</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Prospects for major commercial property<BR>developments in emerging markets, or black areas, could increase<BR>dramatically once black local government has been legimitised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A morass of technical hurdles, such as identifying owners of land<BR>and registration of title deeds, still remains to be cleared up. So,<BR>too, does the role of numerous community development forums (CDF)<BR>which arose in the wake of the collapse of community councils or<BR>black local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lure of black areas is reinforced by feelings that<BR>developments in areas of high and historical investments are<BR>becoming saturated and generating lower returns (about 10 percent)<BR>in comparison with the vistas beckoning in black areas where returns<BR>are estimated to be worth some two percent higher.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though some major developers have gone ahead with heavy<BR>investments to build substantial portfolios it will still be an<BR>uphill battle. The enormity of the task, says a black property<BR>developer, will require &quot;innovative public sector directives&quot; to<BR>offset the huge &quot;social engineering that went into the making of<BR>black townships&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cites the potential role of the new Facilitation Act in cutting<BR>through red tape, a factor that has dampened the enthusiasm of<BR>property investors to move to black areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he warned against &quot;artificial solutions&quot; that do not take<BR>account of realities and reinforced the view that market forces<BR>should be supplemented, and not supplanted, by local and central<BR>legislative directives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also the reverse prospect of suburban municipalities<BR>delaying applications for development in their own areas and<BR>directing them to areas of less density.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malls in former white areas are becoming congested, pressure is<BR>mounting on transport and other facilities as non residents are<BR>drawn in; already 40 percent of Sandton shoppers are blacks from<BR>townships. Redirecting property developments would be a boon to both<BR>areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even without these measures some headway has been made. Sanlam<BR>Properties seems to be leading the way. In the Gauteng area only it<BR>has put up two major shopping complexes: the 18 900m2 Dobsonville<BR>Shopping Centre near Soweto, opened in 1994 at a cost of R45-million<BR>and the 17 000m2 Daveyton Mall costing R44-million to be opened by<BR>month end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Altogether the company's national portfolio in all black areas,<BR>including coloured and Indian, is now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> worth R500-million. Major anchors like Pick 'n Pay and franchised<BR>food outlets have been involved. Local entrepreneurs take up the<BR>remaining space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These developments are motivated by hard business sense<BR>underpinned by extensive research, consultations with communities,<BR>(through the CDFs) social responsibility and their client base.<BR>Sanlam's policy holders are 65 percent black. And &quot;it is well known<BR>that investment in these areas has been neglected in the past,&quot; says<BR>Banus van der Walt, managing director of Sanlam Properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We see the lack of proper retail space as a business opportunity,<BR>but also as a chance to contribute to the social and economic<BR>upliftment of thousands of people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The private sector is geared to black townships' revamp. &quot;Many<BR>developers would like to see black townships becoming normal suburbs<BR>with all property facilities- shopping complexes, office blocks<BR>etcetera, sprouting up,&quot; says Andre Viljoen of the SA Property<BR>Owners Association, Sapoa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are many developers eager to move in. Already 11 mediumaverage cost of R30-million -- are known to us to be in the<BR>sized shopping centres -- of between five to15 000m2 at an estimated<BR>pipeline,&quot; adds Viljoen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And whether the rise of black-owned insurance companies, like<BR>African Life, a subsidiary of Real Africa Holdings, and Metrolife of<BR>New Africa Investments Limited, would unleash their financial<BR>resources for real property development in black areas is moot.<BR>African Life burnt its fingers with a project in Orlando West and<BR>caution is at a premium with black economic empowerment companies in<BR>the wake of recent hassles experienced by some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Thebe Properties, backed by the massive Thebe Holdings which<BR>has strategic investments in Safrican and other financial<BR>institutions, is geared for new township and other major property<BR>developments in black areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though risks associated with violence have significantly gone<BR>down, says Viljoen, social and legal hurdles still need to be<BR>overcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The biggest problem is land ownership. It is difficult to locate<BR>ownership and the registration of title deeds takes time. Also the<BR>process of consultation with local development forums (made up<BR>mainly of civics and business associations) can be lengthy and<BR>complicated, however necessary it has been. It took Sanlam 2,5 years<BR>to negotiate with such a forum in Dobsonville.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also strong opposition from chambers of local traders<BR>which fear that outside (white) developers might snap up all the<BR>land. However, the imperative of having black partners, in the<BR>climate of black economic empowerment, makes nonsense of such fears.<BR>And major financial institutions have substantial black policy<BR>holders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The key to unlocking real property vistas still depends mainly on<BR>the outcome of local political and social developments, including<BR>the infrastructural revamps that central government has recently<BR>promised are in the pipeline.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>October 20, 1995<BR>by Eddie Koch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The right-wing movement in South Africa has<BR>advanced nuclear weapons and can drop these on any town in the<BR>country by using a squadron of Impalas or at least five G6 cannons<BR>which are in their possession. This is the most astonishing in a<BR>string of startling claims presented in a book by Peter Hounan and<BR>Steve McQuillan which is due to be published next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authors of The Mini-Nuke Conspiracy, due to be published<BR>today, say they have been told by numerous sources that an arsenal<BR>of state-of-the-art nuclear bombs is being used by the white right<BR>wing to back demands for an Afrikaner volkstaat and to keep the new<BR>government from making too many radical changes to the country --<BR>and President Nelson Mandela is aware of this.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book's claims, some of which have already been published in a<BR>national newspaper, are shocking enough to make governments around<BR>the world tremble and to send the local stock exchange into a<BR>tailspin. That they have not done so is probably because the<BR>allegations come from a string of unnamed &quot;intelligence sources&quot;,<BR>&quot;security agents&quot;, and &quot;sources close to British intelligence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A man given the pseudonym Jan, and described as a &quot;senior<BR>intelligence agent&quot;, is quoted as saying: &quot;They have more than one<BR>shell -- the standard tactical nuclear shell -- and the present<BR>government knows about their capability ... The G6, the system<BR>designed to deliver a nuclear shell, is the weapon. They have five<BR>of them, and a stockpile of shells, all being moved around the<BR>country to strategic positions -- the majority within easy reach of<BR>Gauteng.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book adds: &quot;A committee of right-wing retired senior police,<BR>military and Military Intelligence officers, some of them generals,<BR>were commanding the weapons ... 'to prevent even renegade elements<BR>of the right wing from getting hold of them'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another source named as Rick, &quot;a government agent who had<BR>penetrated the right wing&quot;, is quoted as saying that he had<BR>personally seen a warhead and a long missile like a Scud that was<BR>under guard by the right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even the assassination of academic David Webster is attributed to<BR>the nuclear conspiracy. &quot;Hennie, a military agent, said ... he had<BR>heard that David Webster, a Johannesburg anthropologist, was murdered<BR>because he saw too much on field trips near the range. 'I was led to<BR>believe he was killed because he saw a nuclear device that was about<BR>to be fired ...'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The green light for South Africa's Olympic dream<BR>shone faintly this week when Cabinet decided to support the<BR>preparations for the 2004 Games, but warning lights flashed over the<BR>possible cost to taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cabinet's decision came in the same week as the organising<BR>committee for the 1996 Games in Atlanta -- the home of megafor making a profit are virtually non- existent.<BR>corporations like Coca-Cola and CNN -- admitted that its prospects</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A budget presented to Cabinet by the Cape Town Olympic Bid Company<BR>in preparation for the Cabinet decision required central government<BR>to spend R979-million over the next 10 years, but promised a separate<BR>surplus of R94- million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bid chief executive Chris Ball welcomed the Cabinet's decision and<BR>said national and provincial finance and transport experts would now<BR>join his staff to form &quot;Team South Africa&quot; to prepare for the bid<BR>process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A bullish Ball said the message to the world now was that the<BR>South African bid was proceeding -- it had the full support of the<BR>Cabinet and national business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But serious reservations about the budget presented to Cabinet<BR>were raised this week by a chartered accountant, who analysed it on<BR>behalf of the Mail &amp; Guardian. He said a major question left<BR>unanswered was how it could be assumed that South Africa could make a<BR>profit out of the Games while other more sophisticated countries<BR>failed to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cape Town Olympic Bid Company predicts a total revenue of<BR>R4.2-billion, an expenditure of R2.9- billion, a gross surplus of<BR>R1.3-billion and, after expenditure on sports facilities, housing<BR>subsidies and a contingency fund, a net surplus of R94-million. The<BR>private sector is required to provide R279- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Cape Town's budget is generally optimistic, even though it is<BR>difficult to predict the situation in nine years' time,&quot; the<BR>accountant said. &quot;We don't know what the state of the South African<BR>economy will be in 2004 and what exchange rates will be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The problem this creates is that the budget is a bit of a<BR>thumbsuck as this is a once-in-a-lifetime affair and there are no<BR>annual budgets to compare it to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The accelerated capital budget makes no provision for interest on<BR>loans the government would have to raise if they bring that<BR>expenditure forward. There is a risk that those additional costs will<BR>be passed on to taxpayers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another serious problem identified by the accountant was that the<BR>budget predicts that Cape Town requires an additional 70 000 hotel<BR>beds for the Games, a staggering amount for the private sector to<BR>meet and continue to fill after the Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the budget allows for a R150-million subsidy on Olympic<BR>housing, which could be sold to low-income earners after the Games,<BR>he believed not enough thought had gone into the upgrading and<BR>development required outside the site, which he believed the IOC<BR>would require and the new owners might not be able to afford to<BR>support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He doubted whether the number of tickets sold would come close to<BR>that of the Barcelona Games, which were little more than a train ride<BR>away from Britain and other European countries. Tickets would<BR>probably be relatively expensive for South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The accountant said he was also concerned that South African<BR>business would not be able to afford to sponsor the Games. Although<BR>the budget predicts sponsorship at 40 percent below Sydney's<BR>projection, South Africa's market was much smaller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ball responded by saying he was condifent South Africa would<BR>receive sufficient corporate sponsorship. He admitted that ticket<BR>prices would probably be beyond &quot;Soweto's&quot; reach and that issue would<BR>need to be examined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The big difference between our bid and Atlanta's is that Atlanta<BR>received zilch from central and state government. Every cent had to<BR>be raised by their committee,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Monitor (Kampala)<BR>October 4, 1995<BR>by Sarah Mirembe<BR>...Uganda - Uganda has been steadily losing its coffee export market<BR>share since 1990 because of the high risk of its coffee, the<BR>Executive Secretary of the Uganda Coffee Exporters Association<BR>(UCEA), Frederick Mulalila Kawuma has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kawuma who was speaking at a press conference last week said &quot;with<BR>the exception of Germany, Uganda's position has been crumbling<BR>everywhere, losing its coffee market share since 1990, despite the<BR>fact that total European imports of green coffee have been relatively<BR>stable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even in Germany, the increase in Uganda imports is part of a<BR>general trend rather than a phenomenon particular to Uganda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Many coffee roasters and importers believe that Uganda's origin<BR>risk has increased since the reforms in the coffee sector were begun.<BR>Several sited delays in deliveries, and the increased number of<BR>private exporters is seen as a factor increasing the commercial<BR>risk.&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's coffee quality has also decreased due to factors related<BR>to post harvest processing. &quot;Earthy taste, cherries, broken beans and<BR>other flaws have been observed in Uganda's green coffee samples.<BR>There has been an increase in the number of quality disputes,&quot; he<BR>said adding that some roasters have, for that matter, already<BR>abandoned Uganda's coffee or are considering seeking substitutes,<BR>particularly in Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports from UCDA said by the close of last week, prices had<BR>dropped to US$ 2220 per tonne, down from US$ 4100 per tonne last<BR>September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The nose-diving of coffee prices to their lowest in a ten week<BR>period last week was due to the refusal of a group of Brazilian<BR>exporters to participate in the private exporters retention plan,&quot;<BR>the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prices were however beginning to recover due partly to the news<BR>that rain in Brazil was going to be very slight and news of a likely<BR>increase in global demand for instant coffee especially in the<BR>developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plunge in world coffee prices has sent shock waves to the<BR>coffee exporters who fear being thrown out of business. UCEA<BR>Executive Director, Kawuma, warned coffee exporters not to commit<BR>themselves on contracts which they will be unable to deliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kawuma said the fall in world prices had also hit hard at the<BR>farmers who were currently getting peanuts out of their coffee.<BR>&quot;Today, farmers are paid between Shs 600-700 down from Shs 1500 per<BR>kilo of kiboko,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last season, Uganda exported three million 60 kg bags of coffee.<BR>This year, the number is expected to fall to only 2.5 million bags<BR>because of the fall in prices.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposal seeks to establish a facility that will refinance<BR>servicing of the debt to the World Bank, IMF and the African<BR>Development Bank, the three major institutions owed most by the Third<BR>World.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will benefit heavily indebted economies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda, Zambia, Cote d'Ivoire, Guyana, Bolivia and Nicaragua have<BR>been billed the prime beneficiaries of the project, according to the<BR>NOVIB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fund which will initially be $11 billion could be increased,<BR>the IMF agrees to sell part of its gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The facility will be funded from the World Bank extra<BR>profit(windfall) of $800 million but needs enhancement from the IMF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposal will be tabled during the Annual General meeting of<BR>the World Bank and IMF to take place between October 9 and 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Documents availed to &quot;The Monitor&quot; indicate that the IMF staff<BR>including its director Michel Camdessus, and key members -- Japan,<BR>Germany and France -- strongly oppose the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They argue that the scheme will reduce resources to the<BR>International Development Agency(IDA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conservatives in the World Bank, including one of its vice<BR>presidents, Johannes Linns, are also strongly against the scheme that<BR>has been produced by the bank's division on Debt and Financial<BR>policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> World Bank president Wolfensohn has been in Japan to persuade it<BR>to endorse the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Proponents of the scheme communicated to indebted Commonwealth<BR>countries, to use their ongoing Finance ministers meeting in Jamaica<BR>to &quot;strongly support the move and have it as one of their<BR>resolutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's Finance and Economic Planning Minister Mayanja Nkangi did<BR>not mince his condemnation of the IMF, for opposing the scheme, in<BR>his address to the Commonwealth ministers on Wednesday, October 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The IMF is less forthcoming and flexible in agreeing to proposals<BR>for debt relief,&quot; Nkangi told the meeting.  &quot;Uganda welcomes the<BR>brave step taken by the World Bank (in proposing the facility).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said efforts by the Paris Club to cancel and reschedule<BR>Uganda's debt, which stands at $3 billion plus, could not go far<BR>since three quarters of all debt is owed to IMF, World Bank and<BR>African Development Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkangi said the new debt relief scheme would meet up to 67 percent<BR>of multi-lateral debt servicing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Recommendations for the future management of Table<BR>Mountain and the rest of the Peninsula mountain chain are to be<BR>presented to Environmental Affairs Minister Dawie de Villiers today<BR>and may propose the establishment of a national park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recommendations, which could end decades of often acrimonious<BR>debate and divided management, are in the report of the Table<BR>Mountain advisory committee, constituted for De Villiers by Cape<BR>attorney general Frank Kahn and headed by National Botanical<BR>Institute chief executive Prof Brian Huntley.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee finalised its recommendations at a meeting at<BR>Kirstenbosch this week. It considered a proposal by the National<BR>Parks Board that t Peninsula's protected natural environment area<BR>should be managed as a contractual national park in association with<BR>existing landowners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were also proposals from Cape Nature Conservation and the<BR>Cape Metropolitan Council, both of which said they did not want to<BR>manage a consolidated nature are and suggested a new body should be<BR>established for this purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speculation is that the committee will recommend the national park<BR>option.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Monitor (Kampala)<BR>October 9, 1995<BR>by Kyazze Simwogerere<BR>...Kampala - Uganda celebrates its 33rd Independence anniversary<BR>today, only 24 hours after completing a 19-month exercise that<BR>brought in the country's fourth and newest Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were no sensations similar to those experienced by people at<BR>the dawn of a New Year, yet this new law has quite a few innovations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the most fundamental issues is that of land. The CA<BR>delegates are supposed to have passed an article that vests land in<BR>Uganda, in the hands of the people under the customary, freehold,<BR>&quot;mailo&quot; and leasehold tenure systems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as with many provisions in the new Constitution, the delegates<BR>shied away from resting land.  There was a powerful lobby of landabsolute ownership to the millions of peasant farmers living as<BR>lords, whose huge clout made it impossible for the CA to give<BR>&quot;kibanja&quot; on &quot;mailo&quot; land. This also goes for the explosive issues of<BR>the lost counties, where Baganda gentry--Minister Zimula Mugwanya has<BR>a reported area as big as a county in Kibale--have large tracts of<BR>land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The uneviable task of finding ways of accommodating the interest<BR>of the land-lords and the &quot;kibanja&quot; holders. The delegates had the<BR>temerity to give the new parliament two years from Sunday to complete<BR>a task they even feared to define.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women were not so terribly upset with what they got out of the<BR>Constitution-making process, after all some of the most progressive<BR>clauses concern their welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None of the previous constitutions had provisions allowing for the<BR>special representation of women in Parliament. This one does. As<BR>things stand now, any new parliament shall have at least 39 women<BR>law-makers--representing the districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as with land, the CA dithered about the manner of electing<BR>these ladies.  One of the biggest complaints out of the 1994 CA<BR>elections was that many women unfairly won because of the small<BR>electoral colleges (less than 200 each), whose members they allegedly<BR>bought and manipulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically the issue of women went to the division lobby, when<BR>some members argued that they should decide that the women be elected<BR>by Universal adult suffrage in the districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All these responsibilities have made the new parliament the<BR>strongest Uganda will have.  The law-makers will, for instance, have<BR>powers to veto presidential appointments, impeach the main man if<BR>they had to, change the political system etc...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the new House also got some unenviable tasks, but the most<BR>eagerly awaited is the relationship the Parliamentarians will have<BR>with President Yoweri Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the last nine years, Museveni has been the Chairman of the<BR>National Resistance, effectively fusing the powers of the legislature<BR>and the executive. This was essentially because the NRC was<BR>Museveni's show, which he started in 1986 with about 33<BR>&quot;Historicals&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nine years and 117 Statutes later, the NRC should wind up business<BR>in the next six months with another nine bills and two resolutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although it passed groundbreaking legislation especially on women<BR>and the press, the NRC has been considered by many as an apendage of<BR>the executive, with no teeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The members would make occasional noises and &quot;jam&quot; to pass some<BR>bills. Then Museveni would take them into closed sessions and wave<BR>the big stick. He hardly ever got a negative result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new parliament is likely to be a whole new ball-game,<BR>considering they get to elect their own Speaker, that Museveni has no<BR>right to closed sessions, and there will be quite a number of<BR>&quot;opposition&quot; politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new constitution also guarantees the basic human rights, of<BR>life (except for murderers).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the biggest battles was of course on the political systems.<BR>The CA eventually entrenched the Movement Political system, the<BR>Multi-party political and any other, which Ugandans might want to<BR>have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The catch of course, is that no two systems will operate<BR>simultaneously, and at the end of each, there would be a referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The quarrel that the multi-partyists have is the NRM (or Movement<BR>Political System) has the inside track on the issue since it is in<BR>power.  They consider this a violation of their birthright to<BR>associate. Maybe that explains why the National Caucus for Democracy<BR>(NCD), a loose grouping of multi-partyists in the CA, has now changed<BR>to National Convention for Democracy, to evade the clauses that bar<BR>parties from making public announcements of their existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it was not all gain for everyone in the CA. There were the<BR>Baganda, whose &quot;conc federo&quot; demands fell on dead ears, and made the<BR>once amiable &quot;Ssabalangira&quot; Besweri Mulondo a much revilled figure in<BR>the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are still a few things that can be done by government<BR>&quot;public interest,&quot; although there is no precedence for any REAL<BR>&quot;public interest&quot; in Uganda's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tough questions should new begin, now that the new<BR>constitution is in force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a matter of information, Uganda has now had four Constitutions<BR>in its 33 years, giving us on average, a new document every eight<BR>years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let's hope this one lasts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The African Book Publishing Record (Oxford)<BR>October 11, 1995<BR>...Oxford - Marlene van Niekerk's novel &quot;Triomf,&quot; published in 1994<BR>by Queillerie Publishers, Pretoria, South Africa, has been named as<BR>the winner o the 1995 Noma Award for Publishing in Africa. This is<BR>the first time in the Award's fifteen-year history that a work in<BR>Afrikaans has been selected as the prize winner.  The book was cited<BR>by the Noma Award jury as &quot;a captivating and innovative novel by a<BR>masterly story-teller, which breaks new ground in describing the ways<BR>in which poor white Afrikaaners, too, were victims of oppression, and<BR>thus ushers in a wholly new way of addressing the past as a prelude<BR>to the new.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The novel focuses on the humdrum lives of a family in the<BR>Johannesburg suburb of Triomf (Triumph) built on the ruins of the<BR>racially-mixed Sophiatown, bulldozed to the ground by the apartheid<BR>state to make room for cheap housing for 'poor white' Afrikaaners.<BR>looked down on the rest of the white population, they fear the black<BR>population; ignored by both groups, they live their lives with very<BR>little hope of improvement. The novel captures the monotony of their<BR>speech and lifestyles as second-class citizens, but at the same time<BR>the author succeeds in portraying their banal and bleak everyday<BR>existence as often poetic and moving. &quot;Triumph&quot; represents an<BR>important stream within Afrikaans literature of reconsidering the<BR>history of South Africa, and the themes of the novel exemplify key<BR>issues in current postcolonial discourses about identities: national,<BR>linguistic, and gender-related.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Committee to Protect Journalists (New York)<BR>October 16, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His Excellency Captain E. M. Strasser Chairperson, National<BR>Provisional Ruling Council. Your Excellency, The Committee to Protect<BR>Journalists (CPJ) writes to strongly protest the arrest of journalist<BR>Chernor Ojukwu Sesay who was detained immediately upon return to<BR>Sierra Leone after being deported from The Gambia where he sought<BR>refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sesay, previously a freelance journalist in Sierra Leone, fled to<BR>The Gambia in early May 1995 due to a well-founded fear of<BR>persecution. He was working with the independent Daily Observer when<BR>he was picked up by Gambian immigration authorities, detained for two<BR>days, then deported back to Sierra Leone on October 12. It is<BR>believed his arrest in The Gambia was linked to an article he wrote<BR>in the Daily Observer about the police beating of two Sierra Leonean<BR>nationals in Banjul. Upon arrival to Freetown, Sierra Leonean police<BR>arrested him and are currently holding him in the Criminal<BR>Investigations Division (CID).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No official reason has been given for Sesay's arrest. While the<BR>police have stated that his departure from Sierra Leone without<BR>clearance accounts for his detention, no legal regulation has been<BR>cited. Moreover, it is our belief that Sesay is being held due to his<BR>journalistic work in Sierra Leone before he fled.  CPJ has documented<BR>the harassment of Sesay and his colleague, Siaka Massaquoi of Vision,<BR>by military police in January 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out of profound concern for Mr. Sesay's welfare, we called the CID<BR>earlier today and spoke directly with the head of the Division, Mr.<BR>Hallowell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ has documented at least nine incidents of abuse of the press<BR>in Sierra Leone, the most so far this year in Sub-Saharan Africa. We<BR>have written to Your Excellency twice before this year protesting the<BR>persecution of journalists in your country. We again join the chorus<BR>of voices calling for your government's adherence to minimum<BR>standards of human rights, inlcuding press freedom, as guaranteed by<BR>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant<BR>for Civil and Political Rights, and the African Charter on Human and<BR>Peoples' Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for your consideration.  We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington - The following has been released by the White House:<BR>STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States is deeply concerned about reports that the<BR>Nigerian military regime has moved several alleged coup plotters from<BR>Lagos to an ill-equipped and sub-standard prison in the northeastern<BR>part of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">We remain concerned about reports of<BR>maltreatment and the failure to afford regular medical treatment to<BR>those detained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States condemns the long prison sentences imposed on<BR>those Nigerian military officers and civilians accused of coupformer President Olusegun Obasanjo and human rights activist Beko<BR>plotting, including four life sentences, the fifteen year terms dealt<BR>Ransome-Kuti and the twenty-five year term imposed upon General Shehu<BR>Musa Yar'Adua.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the arrests began last March, the United States, the<BR>international community and a broad spectrum of Nigerians have<BR>consistently deplored the secret trials that have resulted in these<BR>harsh sentences.  We continue to question the validity and harshness<BR>of sentences handed down after secret trials in which some of the<BR>accused were not even publicly charged.  We are aware of no evidence<BR>to substantiate the charges and do not accept the airing of purported<BR>evidence on Nigerian television as a substitute for fair and open<BR>trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States reiterates its call upon the Nigerian Government<BR>to speed the transition to democracy, starting by releasing political<BR>detainees.  The United States will maintain all existing sanctions<BR>and keep other measures under review as we look for progress in the<BR>transition to democracy and the release of political detainees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We believe peace, reconciliation, and justice are the only basis<BR>for a common and harmonious future.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Kenya, being the twelfth African country to do so, has<BR>ultimately joined the Internet - the global Information superhighway.<BR>Disclosing the news, the Director of the African Regional Centre for<BR>Computing (ARCC), Dr. Shem Ochuodho, said this facility will give<BR>Kenyan researchers, educators and businessmen an opportunity never<BR>envisaged before. For several years now, researchers and businessmen<BR>and women from other parts of the world have been able to easily and<BR>readily access valuable information that has eluded their Kenyan<BR>counterparts. The facility, for instance, brings distance learning<BR>(ie. teachers and students across the country appraising themselves<BR>through a non-expensive computer network) and access to export<BR>markets to the fingertip of Kenyan academics and entrepreneurs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya, despite its well developed communications infrastructure<BR>and having ventured early into electronic networking, real-time,<BR>interactive access has remained an illusion, largely due to high<BR>long-distance telephone costs. This for a while has been the case in<BR>many parts of Africa, making it today the only continent not<BR>significantly connected to the &quot;Internet&quot;. However, this state is<BR>fast changing with recent experiences from various parts of the<BR>continent, with at least two African countries joining the net almost<BR>every month over the past 6 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tunisia and South Africa were the first African countries to hook<BR>onto the Internet about 3 years ago. Since then, other countries to<BR>have joined include Algeria, Egypt, Mozambique, Zambia, Ghana,<BR>Uganda, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Morocco and now Kenya. It is understood<BR>from the Nairobi-based ARCC that this historic breakthrough will<BR>mainly benefit education and commerce, to which its initial access<BR>will be directed. Kenya's entry has been made possible through the<BR>kind support of the British Overseas Development Agency (ODA). The US<BR>National Science Foundation (NSF) also offered technical assistance<BR>by sponsoring a week's visit to Kenya of a world renown networking<BR>expert, Mr. Randy Bush to conclude the set-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For nearly 4 years now, a number of institutions have provided or<BR>had electronic mail (e-mail) service in Kenya. However, all these<BR>have been dial-up systems using ordinary telephones to link either to<BR>Europe or United States. The new service relies on a dedicated leased<BR>line rented from KPTC. As other countries move towards higher<BR>quality, greater bandwidth and more cost-effective links, it is hoped<BR>that Kenya will once again be in the frontline.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I do not wish at this juncture to be drawn into the issue as to<BR>the reporting of this case in the press, whether it is correct<BR>reporting or otherwise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I make my own recording of the proceedings and I can not be<BR>influenced by what comes out in the press,&quot; Kalima said before<BR>ruling; &quot;what I am saying is that those recording should continue to<BR>record or continue to record the truth but should record everything<BR>even what is not in their favour.&quot; The prosecution claimed in its<BR>application early this month that The Post was presenting inaccurate<BR>recordings of the case. It also claimed the paper had questioned the<BR>integrity of the magistrate whom it accused of siding with the state<BR>after he revoked bail for managing editor Bright Mwape, his assistant<BR>Goliath Mungonge and former Post and now reporter of The Chronicle<BR>Nkonkomalimba Kafunda as a way of &quot;jolting up their lawyers.&quot; The<BR>other accused person is managing director and editor-in-chief Fred<BR>M'membe. Kalima however turned down a counter application by The Post<BR>to be allowed to use audio and video recorders in court as a way of<BR>enhancing their accuracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I can not grant that because there is no such a law in this<BR>country. It is true the law will one day change but for now we shall<BR>abide by what is on record,&quot; Kalima said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trial could not continue because the Prosecutor Inspector Katongo<BR>has a funeral and was granted leave by the court. Trial continues on<BR>Monday October 30 at 14:30 hours.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The continued delay to release more than US$26 million<BR>meant to facilitate the importation of the grain by the Central Bank<BR>could lead to a serious maize shortage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Grain Growers and Marketing Association chairman George<BR>Lloyd said the money was stuck at the Bank of Zambia (BOZ) because of<BR>disagreements with commercial banks over collateral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a Bank of Zambia (BOZ) official said the bank was merely<BR>acting as a custodian of the money and could only release it after<BR>getting instructions from the finance ministry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We would like to see the deadlock between BOZ and private<BR>comercial banks resolved so that we can access Tanzanian grain. If we<BR>don't access it we shall run into sporadic shortages soon,&quot; Lloyd<BR>said. The $26 million would facilitate the importation of<BR>approximately 1.5 million x 90 kilogram bags of maize. He was<BR>concerned that because of the delay most of the other sources in<BR>neighbouring countries had run out leaving only Tanzania as the ready<BR>source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We hope that the deadlock will be resolved because the issue is<BR>more serious than people realise,&quot; Lloyd warned. He said some members<BR>of the ZGGMA had used their initiative to borrow money in foreign<BR>exchange from commercial banks because of the relative stability in<BR>the value of the kwacha but this was only a small measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the money is released, the private sector has shown in the<BR>past that it can be creative and innovative and could still be able<BR>to arrest the situation,&quot; he said referring to the mealie meal crisis<BR>which hit the country in February resulting in price rises and the<BR>return of queues. Agriculture minister Suresh Desai' said through his<BR>secretary he was in meeting together with his permanent secretary<BR>Austin Sichinga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lloyd urged Zambians to change their eating habits and start<BR>eating maize substitutes like sweet potatoes, rice and bread to<BR>reduce on maize consumption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Article 19, International Centre Against Censorship (London)<BR>October 27, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - The Mozambique government should introduce a freedom of<BR>information law and take other steps to promote a truly independent<BR>media, ARTICLE 19 said on 27 October 1995 in a new report published<BR>on the anniversary of the country's first ever democratic elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 30 page report, &quot;Mozambique: Freedom of Expression and the<BR>&quot;Vote for Peace,&quot;&quot; welcomes the loosening of official controls over<BR>the media in the run-up to, and following the election, but says that<BR>much still needs to be done to guarantee press freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mozambique has come a long way since the agreement which ended<BR>three decades of bitter conflict&quot;, according to ARTICLE 19's<BR>Director, Frances D'Souza. &quot;The election last year was a resounding<BR>vote for peace. But further action is needed urgently both to<BR>guarantee freedom of expression and to address the legacy of the<BR>past.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ARTICLE 19 says the government should rapidly amend the defamation<BR>law, which can be used to imprison journalists who criticise the<BR>President or even foreign heads of state, to bring it into line with<BR>international standards and to take account of the &quot;public interest&quot;.<BR>It also questions the absence of any moves to establish a Truth<BR>Commission, like that set up in South Africa, to account for the<BR>hundreds of thousands of Mozambicans who were victims of<BR>&quot;disappearance&quot;, political killing or other abuses in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Those who lost their loved ones in the war should have the right<BR>to information, where it exists, about their fate&quot;, said Frances<BR>D'Souza.  &quot;And this &quot;consensus for silence&quot;, if it continues, must<BR>not be allowed to hamper future efforts to write objective historical<BR>accounts of the war, either in the media or in academic<BR>institutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ARTICLE 19's report provides a detailed account of the conduct of<BR>the elections and of the role played by the media, including Radio<BR>Mozambique (RM), the main communications medium.  Despite previous<BR>measures to loosen RM's ties with the ruling FRELIMO party, close<BR>monitoring revealed a continuing pro-FRELIMO bias in RM's coverage in<BR>the early stages of the election campaign; however, after meetings at<BR>which this evident bias was relayed to RM. staff a greater balance<BR>was achieved as the campaign progressed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Post Editor-In-Chief Fred M'membe yesterday became the<BR>first Zambian journalist to win the prestigious International Press<BR>Freedom Award. M'membe and four other foreign journalists will<BR>officially receive their awards in New York on December 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The occasion has been set for New York's Marriott Marquis where<BR>United States' best and brightest journalism world honour the<BR>winners. According to a dispatch from the Committee to Protect<BR>Journalist (CPJ) yesterday, the award was in recognition of M'membe's<BR>risking of political persecution and personal hardship to defy<BR>official and unofficial attacks on the independent press in Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This year's winners are on the front line of the battles to<BR>establish a free press around the world,&quot; said CPJ executive director<BR>William Orme Jnr.&quot;Their award honour the struggle of all journalists<BR>who risk their lives to report news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The award presentation is an opportunity for journalists in the<BR>United States to support the courageous colleagues who pursue an<BR>independent voice in the face of attacks, imprisonment, censorship<BR>torture and murder,&quot; said Kati Marton, chair of CPJ board of<BR>directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M'membe will be joined by Russian journalist Yevgeny Kislyov,<BR>Indonesian Ahmad Taufik, Jose Ruben Zamara Marraguin of Guatemala<BR>and Ireland's leading investigative reporter Veronica Guerin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The award comes barely four weeks after M'membe was named the<BR>winner of the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) Press Freedom<BR>award. The awards are given annually by the CPJ to journalists from<BR>around the world who have courageously provided independent news<BR>coverage and view points under difficult conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year's annual awards will be made by Ted Turner, head of<BR>Turner Broadcasting System - the proprietors of CNN.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)<BR>October 31, 1995<BR>by Masautso Phiri</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Former president Kenneth Kaunda has broken his silence on<BR>continued harassment by government and declared that no one will<BR>deport him from Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no way in which anybody can deport me from Zambia and<BR>therefore I don't know what the two Presidents (Chiluba and Muluzi)<BR>are talking about,&quot; Kaunda said in an ex clusive interview yesterday<BR>at his Lusaka's Kalundu residence yesterday.  Kaunda was commenting<BR>on Malawi President Bakili Muluzi's statement that Kaunda was welcome<BR>in Malawian if he is found to be a Malawian. Muluzi said this during<BR>a stop over at Lusaka International Airport on his way home from the<BR>UN.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNIP president was also reacting to recent statements by MMD<BR>leaders. &quot;My harassment is the work of little frightened men who see<BR>nothing except defeat if I continue to lead UNIP. Otherwise I see no<BR>logic in what they are doing,&quot; Kaunda said, adding: &quot;They have no<BR>moral or spiritual grounds for harassing me. Their idea is to harass<BR>me so that out of anger I can leave active politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Kaunda who declared he would not abandon the people of Zambia<BR>for fear of his life also warned President Chiluba and Muluzi to stop<BR>treating their countries as personal property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Zambia belongs to the people of Zambia and Malawi to the people<BR>of Malawi. The two men must stop treating the two countries as if it<BR>is personal properties,&quot; Kaunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked about the statement of &quot;getting rich within four years&quot;<BR>attributed to him by the press in Nairobi the former president said:<BR>&quot;It was a light hearted note, said as a joke. There will be no<BR>vengeance in what I do when UNIP comes back to power. But certainly<BR>the law will take its course. The innocent will be innocent,&quot; Kaunda<BR>said on Monday, adding: &quot;I have managed to get commitments from<BR>investors for Zambia even in South Africa, not traders but serious<BR>investment in industry, manufacturing and agriculture.&quot; According to<BR>recent press reports in Nairobi Kaunda was asked what new formular he<BR>had for resuscitating the Zambian economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Formular? My colleagues who took over from me in 1991 have become<BR>very rich in four years. They must have a good formular. I will ask<BR>them to tell me what this formular is so that I can give it to every<BR>Zambian to become rich in four years,&quot; Kaunda is said to have told<BR>Kenyan journalists.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Committee to Protect Journalists (New York)<BR>October 31, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Honorable Sir Anerood Jugnauth Prime Minister and<BR>Minister of the Interior Office of the Prime Minister. Your<BR>Excellency, The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to<BR>protest the persecution of Namassiwayam Ramalingum, editor of the<BR>weekly L'Independent, by Muslim extremists and Your Excellency's<BR>inaction toward bringing his attackers to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramalingum remains in hiding and his paper closed since his May 29<BR>return to Mauritius from Britain where he fled in March. We believe<BR>police response to the following incidents has been unsatisfactory:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 10, a group of civilians bought all copies of<BR>L'Independent in the predominantly Muslim Plaine Verte area of the<BR>capital Port Louis and publicly burned them. The organizers of this<BR>display declared a prohibition on selling future copies of<BR>L'Ind?pendent in that area. Police made no response.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 12, L'Independent's printing presses were firebombed and<BR>L'Independent's office set on fire. Guards were placed in front of<BR>the offices, and Ramalingum provided police protection for only two<BR>weeks, after which time he was advised by the Police Commissioner to<BR>flee the country. An investigation was said to have been launched,<BR>but no findings were reported. It is believed the perpetrators are<BR>known to the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 16, a group of people held an unauthorized public<BR>demonstration in Port Louis, calling all followers of Allah to murder<BR>Ramalingum and his family. While police had license plate numbers of<BR>some of the rally's speakers, no arrests were made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 17, Muslim leader Maulana Haroon issued a fatwa (death<BR>edict) against Ramalingum. The fatwa remains in effect; his<BR>photograph has been circulated in all the city's mosques and a<BR>citizen death squad was formed. At this public gathering, which<BR>approximately 3,000 people attended, Haroon challenged the authority<BR>of the Police Commissioner and the Special Mobile Forces to protect<BR>Ramalingum, his family and his colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since his return from Britain, Ramalingum has been followed and<BR>threatened. His colleagues have also been harassed in his attackers'<BR>pursuit to track him down. The police have yet to act on any of his<BR>numerous reports and provide police protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is believed these attacks stem from a March 10 article in<BR>L'Independent reprinted from the October 1, 1994 issue of the French<BR>magazine Le Point entitled &quot;The True Life of Mohammad&quot; about the<BR>growth of Islam. Both L'Independent and Le Point are circulated in<BR>Algeria, Tunisia and other predominantly Muslim countries where<BR>reportedly no offense at the article was taken. Because L'Independent<BR>has taken a definitive position against government and corporate<BR>corruption and drug-trafficking, CPJ fears its persecution is<BR>politically motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a nonpartisan group of journalists committed to the defense of<BR>its colleagues, CPJ is deeply concerned about Your Excellency's<BR>apparent reluctance to respond to the aforementioned attacks against<BR>Ramalingum and L'Independent. Mediation efforts by the European<BR>Union, several European ambassadors, and international journalistsour contention that this unwillingness violates Ramalingum's right to<BR>rights organizations were met by Your Excellency's inattention. It is<BR>free expression, a right guaranteed in Article 19 of the Universal<BR>Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19 of the International Covenant<BR>on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 9 of the African Charter<BR>on Human and Peoples' Rights, all to which, we remind Your<BR>Excellency, Mauritius is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, we draw Your Excellency's attention to the 1991<BR>Windhoek Declaration on Promoting an Independent and Pluralistic<BR>African Press, which fellow members of the Southern African<BR>Development Community have adopted. CPJ holds Your Excellency's<BR>government accountable to this declaration and the international<BR>treaties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ calls on Your Excellency to intervene and urge Haroon to<BR>publicly withdraw the fatwa, to bring Ramalingum's attackers to<BR>justice, and to safeguard the right of all journalists in Mauritius<BR>to pursue their work, free from danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His Excellency General Sani Abacha and His Excellency Michael<BR>Agbamuche. Your Excellency: The Committee to Protect Journalists<BR>(CPJ) is writing to reiterate its call for the unconditional and<BR>immediate release of the four journalists imprisoned since May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Anyanwu, publisher and editor in chief of The Sunday<BR>Magazine and Ben Charles Obi, editor of Weekend Classique were given<BR>life imprisonment sentences in July after being tried before a<BR>military tribunal. Kunle Ajibade, executive editor of The News and<BR>George Mbah, an assistant editor of Tell magazine, whose sentences<BR>were unconfirmed, were also detained since mid-May and tried behind<BR>closed doors by the military tribunal. All were among 42 people<BR>charged for their suspected complicity in an alleged March coup<BR>attempt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On October 10, it was announced that the Provisional Ruling<BR>Council amended the sentences of all four journalists to fifteen<BR>years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We remain particularly concerned about Mbah and Ajibade, whose<BR>health continues to fail, and about the personal safety of Anyanwu,<BR>one of two women brought before the military tribunal. We are<BR>disturbed that all the prisoners are living in sub-standard<BR>conditions, enduring maltreatment and torture, and denied medical<BR>attention. Finally, we are extremely concerned that several of these<BR>prisoners have reportedly been moved from Lagos to a prison in the<BR>northeast whose conditions are worse than the prison in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a nonpartisan group of journalists committed to the defense of<BR>its colleagues, CPJ remains resolute in its call for the immediate<BR>and unconditional release of these journalists. We believe their<BR>arrests were based solely on their legitimate work as journalists.<BR>Their rights to the freedom of expression are guaranteed in the<BR>Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on<BR>Civil and Political Rights, and the African Charter on Human and<BR>Peoples' Rights, all to which, we remind Your Excellency, Nigeria is<BR>a signatory.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is incredible yet discomfortingly true that our government has<BR>drawn up a list of people which it is seriously contemplating<BR>deporting to Malawi. Most of men and women on the list were born in<BR>this country. They have grown up, married and raised their families<BR>here. They have in one way or another contributed to the political,<BR>social and economic development of this country. Their roots are<BR>here, and they know of no other country as their home other than<BR>Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I cannot recall one single instance when our leadership was as<BR>deceitful, foolhardy and hypocritical as in this particular instance<BR>in which it sees un Zambianness in some of its own nationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly it is not that the people on the list are criminals,<BR>neither have they been shown to be of doubtful loyalty, questionable<BR>patriotism or casual and dubious commitment to the good cause of the<BR>country. They just happened to have opened their mouths a little<BR>wider than most and spoken their minds, as is their right, on issues<BR>that affect our lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this is not the real reason. These unfortunate people are<BR>merely sacrificial lambs, or blinders as it were, to regularise and<BR>justify the eventual deportation of Kaunda. Kaunda's crime is not<BR>that he is not a Zambian but that he and UNIP under his leadership<BR>provide the only possible and credible alternative to the MMD<BR>government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The folly and senselessness in this whole exercise is that it will<BR>not end with the deportations of a few people to Malawi. Next it will<BR>be those we decide or suspect to be Mozambican, Tanzanian, Zairean,<BR>Zimbabwean or Indian and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already at the Miss Independence pageant in Kitwe, four 'coloured'<BR>girls couldn't be allowed to participate in the competitions on mere<BR>suspicions of their true nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The witch-hunt could go on indefinitely as questions will be<BR>raised to ascertain the true nationality of people occupying senior<BR>positions in the civil service, army, air force, police and other<BR>government institutions. The unrest and disruptions that will ensue<BR>is unthinkable and frightening. When a people as a nation begin to<BR>question each other's place of origin and ethnicity, you might as<BR>well conclude that there is a very serious problem of insecurity and<BR>envy. The end result of this problem is usually ethnic or tribal<BR>discrimination and national disharmony leading to civil strife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is therefore very difficult to believe that the MMD leadership<BR>feels so helplessly insecure that it is totally blind to the grave<BR>consequences to the national social order there will be if it goes to<BR>such lengths to continue to stay in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country stands to pay too high a price for its leadership's<BR>sense of insecurity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's<BR>assassination attracted considerabe sympathy from many African<BR>newspapers, one of which eulogized him as a &quot;warrior among<BR>warriors who chose the path of peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Guardian of Lagos said &quot;Israel has lost a brave leader, a<BR>patriot and an icon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It noted that in his fight for peace Rabin brought to this<BR>cause the same strength and intelligence with which he had<BR>distinguished himself as a soldier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The purpose of the assassination is to undermine the peace<BR>process but Rabin's death will not erase his achievements,&quot; it<BR>said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brushing aside its usual satirical tone, the Ouagadougou<BR>weekly, Le Journal Du Jeudi, compared the death to that of a dove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The peace for which Rabin has sacrificed his life will not be<BR>burried with him,&quot; it said, meaning the process will go on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it said that the Mideast peace effort may be boxed in<BR>by Jewish and Arab extremists, a situation from which it will be<BR>very difficult to extricate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A privately-owned daily from the same city, Le Pays, said that<BR>Rabin's death should mark the final stage in making the peace<BR>process between Palestinians and Jews irreversible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several papers questioned Israel's future following the<BR>slaying. The Ouagadougou weekly, Le Clef, said the assassination<BR>could push back the peace process between Israel and the Arab<BR>countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It, however, said Rabin's demise could also bolster the desire<BR>to rid this region of violence once and for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His death, the Kinshasa weekly La Societe said, &quot;should be a<BR>lesson to politicians the world over, who refuse to understand,<BR>that sensible nations now aspire to peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It and other papers questioned the legendary efficiency of the<BR>Israeli security apparatus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;How can it be explained that none of the prime minister's body<BR>gaurds opened fire on the terrorist?&quot; L'observateur Paalga, of<BR>Ouagadougou, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For their part, papers in Tripoli, the Libyan capital,<BR>condemned the presence of two Arab leaders and the representative<BR>of five other Arab countries at Rabin's funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Arab officials who attended the funeral have betrayed the<BR>martyrs of the Arab nation,&quot; Al-Fajr Al-Jadid said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Al-Chams, attacked Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and<BR>Jordan's King Hussein for eulogising in English rather than in<BR>their native Arab language, as other world leaders had done in<BR>theirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abidjan's and Accra's privately-owned dailies, La Paix and the<BR>Ghanaian Chronicle, said Rabin's death showed he was on the right<BR>path and the peace process should be supported by all nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Premier Rabin's death will become a tragic one only if those<BR>he has left behind are not able to sustain the peace efforts,&quot; the<BR>Chronicle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The only question now is whether Mr. Peres (will have a free<BR>hand from the considerably influential military), to continue the<BR>peace process,&quot; La Paix added. Shimon Peres is Israel's interim<BR>prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi's Kenya Times said the killing put the entire MIddle<BR>East peace process &quot;under a severe litmus test&quot;. The sole<BR>consolation peace searchers had, it continued, was the assurance<BR>by Shimon Peres that &quot;the road to peace is at a point of no<BR>return.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adding to this, the paper said &quot;The powers of peace remain<BR>stronger for a better Israel and Palestine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said there was more to the assassination than simply &quot;orders<BR>from God&quot; and that &quot;perhaps the subsequent police inquiry will<BR>reveal something more than that ridiculous statement,&quot; made by the<BR>killer, Yigal Amir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One Lagos daily, ThisDay, said, &quot;Rabin may have been silenced<BR>by the assassin's bullet but peace in the Middle East must be the<BR>fitting honour to a life-lived.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It continued: &quot;Now the path of the future must be devoid of the<BR>screeching mortars, the whining of shells and the clatter of<BR>machine guns. So did Yitzhak Rabin want it; so should it be.<BR>Adieu.&quot;<BR>-0</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, SENEGAL - Fallout from the hanging of nine Ogoni<BR>minority rights activists in Nigeria November 10 continues from<BR>irate or otherwise troubled African newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Nigerian state could not convince the world that it killed<BR>criminals; it killed people with a cause, a just cause, and<BR>therein lies the difference,&quot; A.M. News, of Lagos, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Government and its defenders have since made a noise or two<BR>about laws dealing with murder not being subjected to<BR>international standards. We beg to disagree. No country is an<BR>island, and Nigeria should not be seen as one,&quot; it added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The privately-owned daily, recalled government's justication of<BR>the hanging was that the nine had murdered four other Ogoni<BR>leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We at A.M. News believe that murder must be punished but only<BR>through justice,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recalling sanctions against Nigeria, visa restrictions against<BR>its citizens, and the country's suspension from the Commonwealth,<BR>as well as a freeze in foreign investments in the country, it<BR>said: &quot;Today Nigeria is a pariah without equal in the entire<BR>world. One diminutive man from Ogoni and his comrades have ensured<BR>that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another private Lagos daily, Third Eye, said about Nigeria,<BR>&quot;What we are witnessing right (now) is, we admit, not entirely the<BR>fault of the Abacha regime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His government, it said, &quot;inherited an unviable and unenviable&quot;<BR>political economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The beginning of the country's current predicament and Abacha's<BR>many headaches, it claimed, are firmly anchored in the military12 June 1993.<BR>contrived annulment of the now proverbial presidential election of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We make this point in order to put in bold relief and proper<BR>perspective the current spate of sanctions against the Abacha<BR>regime,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But government, it noted, had been &quot;visibly shaken by the<BR>hurricane of trenchant criticisms&quot; and multiple sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime was, to all appearances, counting on the historic or<BR>traditional ties with some western countries, in particular Great<BR>Britain. It said, too, that the regime may also have expected to<BR>exploit &quot;the legendary western double-speak, double-standards and<BR>hypocrisy&quot; to wriggle out of an admittedly tight corner. But none<BR>of these expectations was met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Abacha regime and, by the play of logic, Nigeria --<BR>hitherto Africa's most respected country -- have been stripped<BR>naked at the bar of global opinion. And the verdict is, to say the<BR>least, unflattering,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Given the importance of Nigeria in the community of nations<BR>and the movement, worldwide, to liberal democracy and respect for<BR>fundamental liberities, our leaders should not expect the world to<BR>leave us alone, to our whims, caprices and fancies. In a nutshell,<BR>Nigeria is too important a country, however one looks at her, to<BR>be ignored.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It concluded: &quot;We are happy that the head of state, both in his<BR>1 October independence anniversary speech and in subsequent<BR>pronouncements said his administration had not closed the door to<BR>other views aside government's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That willingness for dialogue, it may seem, proded the<BR>government to send a delegation to London to explain the hangings<BR>to the British government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Senegalese daily, Sud Quotidien, explained it<BR>differently. It said that the military junta had realised that &quot;it<BR>can break a rope by pulling too hard on it&quot; therefore, it had to<BR>ease up on its tough approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this behaviour of acting tough -- the executions -- then<BR>stepping back after the act -- the delegation to London in an<BR>attempt to appease the world -- its said, was just part of<BR>miltiary political brinksmanship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then, it attacked Shell Oil for appearing to be the spokesman<BR>of the Nigerian government. Rather than reacting to accusatiion<BR>that Shell was partially responsible for the death of the nine<BR>Ogonis, it said, the oil company had started giving the<BR>international community moral lessons by telling them that<BR>sanctions against it and Nigeria were illconceived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, the paper went on, &quot;What is really unacceptable, is the<BR>situation in which the Ogonis find themselves and in which Shell<BR>has played a significant role.&quot;<BR>-0Africa-at-Large</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwe-based unit said the region's emergency food<BR>requirements in 1995/96 dropped from an initial forecast of 7.1<BR>million tons to 3.9 million tons of aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SADC is an economic grouping of 12 countries, all of them<BR>except Mauritius in drought-prone southern Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reduction in food needs in the region was due largely to a<BR>change in South African estimates. The shortfall there had dropped<BR>from 3 million tons to 532,000 tons, the unit said in a report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SADC said South Africa's revised figures where a result of<BR>factors including a 700,000-ton decrease in consumption estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was also the reduction in cereal stocks by 1.3 million<BR>tons, to be carried forward to the next season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tanzania, which expected a shortfall of 444,000 tons, was now<BR>predicting a surplus of 116,000 tons, while Zambia had dropped its<BR>requirement by 260,000 tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for Zimbabwe the shortfall had risen, with harvest figures<BR>falling 116,000 tons below original estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although South Africa would have to import staple white maize<BR>for domestic consumption it had excess yellow maize for export to<BR>other countries in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All SADC countries were, however, expected to import wheat,<BR>with the greatest shortfalls of 242,000 tons and 427,000 tons in<BR>Zimbabwe and South Africa, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, there was general concern within SADC over the poor<BR>response from the international community to the appeal for food<BR>aid made in June this year. Only 476,000 tons of food aid was<BR>pledged by mid-August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Greater reliance would have to be placed not only on strategic<BR>grain reserves but on commercial imports which would be<BR>detrimental to the region's economic adjustment programmes,&quot; the<BR>unit said.<BR>-0Lesotho and South Africa</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KIGALI, Rwanda - Still shattered by the sight of skulls of<BR>massacre victims in a Rwandan church, former U.S. President Jimmy<BR>Carter Monday expressed hope that forthcoming talks in Cairo will<BR>bring lasting peace to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carter announced in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, that the<BR>government here had officially agreed to participate in the summit<BR>next week to resolve the crises in the so-called Great Lakes<BR>region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing a news conference here, Carter hoped the meeting, to<BR>be held in Cairo from 28 November to 2 December, will have a<BR>limited agenda, the Rwandan News Agency (ARP) reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr.Carter, who will be the summit's chief mediator, said he<BR>hoped the meeting would encourage the quick return of genuine<BR>Rwandan refugees and an end to intimidation within refugee camps<BR>in Tanzania and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An estimated two million Rwandan Hutu refugees have been living<BR>in camps in Rwanda and Tanzania since the massacres which<BR>followed the death of President Juvenal Habyariamana in a plane<BR>crash on April 6, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the meeting will discuss ways of stopping the flow of<BR>arms to the refugee camps. He hoped the discussions will build up<BR>support for the Arusha International Tribunal which is expected to<BR>try the perpetrators of genocide in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other mediators at the summit will be former Tanzanian<BR>President Julius Nyerere and Archbishop Desmond Tutu of Cape Town,<BR>South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit is expected to be attended by the presidents of<BR>Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carter told journalists that among the sights that stuck in his<BR>mind during his two-day visit in Rwanda were the skulls he saw at<BR>the altar of Ntarama Parish Church near Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least 5,000 people were butchered at Ntarama church during<BR>last year's genocide in which up to one million people, mostly<BR>from the minority Tutsi ethnic group and moderates from the<BR>majority Hutu were massacred by extremists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Remains of the dead are still inside the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carter said that representatives of non-government<BR>organizations and human rights groups had confirmed to him that<BR>conditions inside Rwanda were ripe for the return of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former President and his wife Rosalyn left for Bujumbura<BR>where he will hold similar talks before returning to Uganda. He<BR>will also visit Zaire.<BR>-0Algeria</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance Minister Ronald Penza has issued new regulations to<BR>back up the current banking and financial services and plug<BR>loopholes in the banking industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under new regulations, banks and financial institutions will be<BR>compelled to surrender 50 per cent of their profits to a reserve<BR>fund before declaring dividends to ensure that the liquidity of<BR>any bank matches its paid-up equity capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government has also raised the initial capital required for<BR>anybody to set up a bank</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The review of the country's banking laws follows the closure of<BR>two indigenous banks this year.<BR> Last week, the central bank ordered the closure of Africa<BR>Commercial Bank because of liquidity problems caused by unchecked<BR>insider borrowing.<BR> Meridien BIAO bank, which was the fourth largest bank in Zambia<BR>with over 40,000 deposit accounts, was forced into compulsory<BR>liquidation last September after it collapsed last year.<BR> It has not been able to give depositors their money despite<BR>earlier promises that this was to be done within six months of the<BR>bank's fall.<BR> In 1992 the government liberalized the money market leading to a<BR>proliferation of banks, most of which are feared to be on the<BR>verge of ruin due to increased competition on the money market.<BR> Zambia has 15 major banks and several finance houses, mostly<BR>privately-owned.<BR> Finance experts say the number banks are too large to be<BR>sustained by the country's depressed economy.<BR>-0Rwanda</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - As part of the Zambian capital's 'keep the<BR>city clean' and anti-pollution campaigns, Lusaka City Council has<BR>stopped the mourners from laying plastic wreaths at the city's<BR>cemeteries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saying they were &quot;dirty&quot; and contrary to the council's<BR>environmental regulations, the city fathers threatened to sweep<BR>clean any graves bedecked with plastic flowers. The flowers would<BR>then be torched. &quot;We shall collect and destroy all the plastic<BR>wreaths at council cemeteries if the public refuse to cooperate,&quot;<BR>said council spokesman Daniel M'soka.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials at the Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ)<BR>responsible for enforcing the country's environment laws supported<BR>the city's move, declaring the wreaths and plastics in general as<BR>an environmental &quot;nuisance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move has however angered wreath sellers, mostly young men<BR>and women who say they make a roaring business selling them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Council should stop being funny. Who says they can speak<BR>for the dead. This is a free economy and anybody is free to use<BR>their initiative to make ends meet,&quot; said Charles Tembo, one of<BR>the regular vendors. The plastic wreaths, costing a few cents<BR>each, are assembled using multi-colored pieces of plastic paper,<BR>which are in some cases, picked up from streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Funeral wreaths are a relatively new rite among indigenous<BR>Zambians but are now seen as a status symbol for bereaved<BR>families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Catholic priest in Lusaka two years ago raised a storm when<BR>he suggested that Zambians were being &quot;brain-washed&quot; into adopting<BR>Western life-styles.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Christian churches, to which most Zambians belong,<BR>generally recommend fresh twigs for wreaths to symbolize life at<BR>ressurection.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba said Wednesday only economic sanctions could eventually<BR>bring the regime to its knees and force it to restore democratic<BR>governance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that while it might take long for sanctions to yield<BR>the desired results, they were the most viable course of action<BR>capable of bringing down the military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Some people might think Nigeria is too economically powerful<BR>for sanctions, but look at what happened to the apartheid regime<BR>in South Africa,&quot; he said in reference to the international<BR>sanctions generally credited for forcing the white minority<BR>regime to agree to a new democratic South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria was recently suspsended from the 53-member Commonwealth<BR>of Nations following the execution of nine minority rights<BR>activists in defiance of international appeals for clememcy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said they now have to explain themselves to &quot;friendly<BR>countries&quot; that might have been misled into taking tough action<BR>against their country after the recent hanging of nine minority<BR>rights activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the first meeting of the country's 26-member Provisional<BR>Ruling Council (PRC), chaired by Gen. Sani Abacha, since the Nov.<BR>10 executions of the nine Ogoni ethnic minority leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The movement led a campaign against environmental damage to<BR>Ogoni territory in south-eastern Nigeria caused by oil production.<BR>It singled out the Nigerian government and the oil giant Shell as<BR>the main culprits.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mkapa and his party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) or Party of the<BR>Revolution, polled 60 percent in the presidential elections held<BR>on Oct. 29 and repeated Nov. 19 in Dar es Salaam, the capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CCM, which has ruled Tanzania since 1977 when it was formed,<BR>polled 80 percent of the vote in the parliamentary elections.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his speech to thousands of people at the national stadium<BR>here, Mwinyi paid tribute to Tanzania's founder president, Julius<BR>Nyerere, saying his sound advise enabled him to deal with<BR>difficult situations during his term of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When you voted for me for the presidency 10 years ago, I<BR>compared the father of the nation with Mount Kilimanjaro (the<BR>highest mountain in Africa) and myself as an ant-hill when it came<BR>to leadership.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Nyerere's advice, particularly during the last three<BR>years of his rule enabled him to relinguish the presidency while<BR>the country was peaceful.<BR> -0South Africa</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York (USA) -- Pushing the United Nations to act against<BR>Nigeria over the recent executions of minority rights activists<BR>would amount to a misuse of the organization, Nigeria's Permanent<BR>Representative to the world body, Ibrahim Gambari, said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told a news conference at the U.N. headquarters in New York<BR>that Nigeria was ready to enter into dialogue with the United<BR>States, which is leading the campaign against his country at the<BR>United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nov. 10 executions for murder of nine Ogoni minority<BR>leaders, including author Ken Saro-Wiwa, have unleashed<BR>international condemnations and anti-Nigeria sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Gambari said &quot;what I am worried about is the misuse of<BR>international organizations such as (the United Nations) to<BR>contravene its own charter provision on non-interference in what<BR>is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of member states.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was referring to the U.N. General Assembly draft resolutions<BR>proposing various actions against Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The envoy said the executions did not &quot;belong in the Security<BR>Council&quot;, apparently in reference to statements by Washington that<BR>it was holding consultations aimed at getting the council to<BR>consider sanctions on Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said &quot;Nigeria did not invade any country. We did not kill<BR>any foreigner.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stressing the need for dialogue, Gambari said the United States<BR>should talk with Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;After all, at the height of the Cold War, the Americans were<BR>talking with the Soviet Union. They are talking now with the North<BR>Koreans, the Chinese and with everybody else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that if United States had &quot; problems with us, they<BR>should give us an opportunity to explain our own side of the story<BR>and work out a way in which we can bring Nigeria back to the road<BR>that we have set for ourselves, which is a return to democratic<BR>civilian rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States has recalled its ambassador in Lagos, imposed<BR>a unilateral arms embargo and extended visa restrictions on<BR>Nigerian officials in protest against the executions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gambari said the trial of those accused of murder was carried<BR>out in public and that the 15 defendants, of whom six were<BR>acquitted, were tried with due regard to the Nigerian law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said though some people might not like the use of a tribunal<BR>in the case, it was not the first time that tribunals were being<BR>used in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gambari said &quot;tribunals were not invented by Nigeria.&quot; They<BR>were &quot;inherited from Britain which used these tribunals to try<BR>some rioters in the Aba (eastern Nigeria) market women's riots of<BR>1929 and which I understand the British still use in Northern<BR>Ireland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He condemned what he called the double standard of the<BR>international community in not criticizing Nigeria's use of<BR>tribunals to try drug traffickers while at the same time<BR>disapproving of the use of a tribunal in the Ogoni case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gambari, who had also briefed the African group in the United<BR>Nations on the Nigerian situation, criticized the western media's<BR>reporting of events that led up the executions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He claimed &quot;there's no balance in your reporting and I appeal<BR>to you to show balance and concern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The diplomat said the Nigerian side of the story, &quot;the story of<BR>the victims of the initial murder&quot;, had not been told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't believe that we have gotten a fair shake,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, some 500 Nigerians resident in Yaounde, capital of<BR>Cameroon, staged a rally Wednesday in support of the military<BR>government of Gen. Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The placard-carrying demonstrators marched to the residence of<BR>Nigerian Ambassador George Bello. Some of the placards read<BR>'Nigeria refuses your uninvited intervention,&quot; &quot;Why are they<BR>sponsoring division in Africa and uniting Europe?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The protesters criticized the stand of South African President<BR>Nelson Mandela on the issue with the slogan: &quot;Mandela: a victim of<BR>apartheid becomes an apostle of imperalism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman, Thompson Okeadu, said the demonstrators were<BR>opposed to Britain and other European countries, the United States<BR>and &quot;neo-colonial African countries&quot; for championing Nigeria's<BR>recent suspension from the Commonwealth which groups together<BR>mostly former British colonies<BR>-0Paris to Host Houphouet-Boigny Prize Ceremony</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, when the fighting ebbs, many inhabitants crowd pubs, clubs<BR>and beer gardens to drown their sorrows in beer, wine and a fiery<BR>banana-based spirit called waragi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Heavy drinking in a land where moderation once was the order of<BR>the day is only one of the symptoms of traumatized society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fabric of society has slowly been torn apart in a power<BR>struggle between the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis, a<BR>replay of a similar conflict between the some ethnic groups in<BR>neighboring Rwanda that cost up to one million lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Burundi, gunmen of rival groups have been battling for<BR>territorial and political control since the assassination of the<BR>first Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye, in October 1993. Before<BR>that, Tutsis dominated the government, and today they still<BR>control the army and police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Panafrica, one of the rare weeklies still circulating in the<BR>Burundian capital crippled by the absence of electricity, took up<BR>the issue of the demon drink recently. It warned that alcoholism<BR>may have become as dangerous to local people as the bullets and<BR>machetes wielded by by gunmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The newspaper spoke about the very high demand for the quart(Saint Froth).<BR>sized Primus beer which its guzzlers now call &quot;Sainte Mousse&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The phenomenon of alcoholism assumes wider proportions as the<BR>war goes on. It has now become so important that, for some people,<BR>the pub has become an address, if not a second residence,&quot; the<BR>newspaper says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the paper, local beer derived from sorghum once<BR>played a key role in traditional festivities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, war has turned it into another weapon for the destruction<BR>of the family as husbands spend more time in bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pub once was a place to relax, trade gossip and enjoy a<BR>pint or two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But war has turned tipplers into bingers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is most striking is that Burundians, notorious for<BR>reporting late for work, land in pubs with uncharacteristic<BR>punctuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thanks to civil strife, though, a dusk to dawn curfew forces<BR>them to go home early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When I do manage to elicit a smile, a look or a word from him,<BR>its like a miracle because he seems to be eternally drunk,&quot; one<BR>housewife said of her husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But then, what does one expect from a people whose lives have<BR>virtually been ruined by a senseless war between centuries-bound<BR>ethnic groups who suddenly find it difficult to live in peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For them, the epicurean dictum &quot;Let's eat, drink and make<BR>merry, for tomorrow we die&quot; has become a religion.<BR>-0Nigeria</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi Thursday<BR>told foreign diplomats sanctions against the West African state<BR>could jeopradize regional security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If sanctions weaken Nigeria...security and economic growth of<BR>our sub-region as well as our responsibility to the world<BR>community will suffer greatly,&quot; he told the diplomats at a special<BR>briefing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria -- which has come under international condemnation and<BR>sanctions over the Nov. 10 executions of nine minority rights<BR>activists charged with murder -- has troops in several United<BR>Nations peace missions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also has the largest contingent of more than 6,000 troops in<BR>the African peace monitoring group (ECOMOG) in war-torn Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ikimi led a government delegation to the recent Commonwealth<BR>summit in Auckland, New Zealand, where Nigeria was suspended from<BR>the organization over the executions, including that of the author<BR>Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa, the United States and the 15-membere European<BR>Union have imposed sanctions on Nigeria and recalled their<BR>ambassadors from Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country is being threatened with more sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ikimi called for dialogue, saying the anti-Nigeria actions by<BR>the international community were based on an inadequate<BR>understanding of events in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the Commonwealth's suspension of Nigeria &quot;was unfair<BR>because it was carried out in an undue haste and without hearing<BR>Nigerian side of the story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister said Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues had not been<BR>tried and convicted for seeking a better life for their Ogoni<BR>people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They were put on trial because they were implicated in the<BR>murder of four rival Ogoni leaders,&quot; Ikimi added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said &quot;the death penalty still exists in Nigeria's statute<BR>books and those convicted of crimes are dealt with on the basis of<BR>the laws of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister expressed surprise at the role of South African<BR>President Nelson Mandela in leading a crusade for more sanctions<BR>against Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The acting dean of the Lagos diplomatic corps, Guinea's Seidu<BR>Jallo, said after the briefing he and his colleagues would report<BR>back to their home governments.<BR> Nigeria has, meanwhile, seen a series of pro-government rallies<BR>denouncing the outcries from the international community.<BR> But local human rights groups say they are in support of the<BR>sanctions, while prominent Lagos lawyer Gani Fawehinmi has taken<BR>government to court over the executions of the Ogoni Nine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military government of Gen. Sani Abacha says it is<BR>reviewing Nigeria's Africa-centred foreign policy in view of the<BR>negative international opinion against the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha has also held consultations with government officials,<BR>traditional rulers and leaders of thought, and set up a 33-member<BR>committee to advise government on apppropriate responses to<BR>actions by the international community.<BR>-0Zimbabwe and South Africa</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - For close to three months now Khady, 21, has<BR>been anxiously waiting for potential expatriate employers,<BR>preferably whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khady is one of several scores of young women waiting in a<BR>street at Dakar's Point E residential area. They chat all day<BR>long, hoping to be be picked as a house-maid.<BR> Estimated at over 88,000, house-maids constitute Senegal's<BR>largest workforce, second to civil servants who number 60,000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A survey conducted in 1993 showed that 80 per cent of these<BR>domestic workers come from the countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of them are aged below 15 and earn as little as 4,500 CFA<BR>francs (about 10 dollars), although they work for 9-12 hours and<BR>get no annual or sick leave, let alone maternity leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khady is the only bread-winner for her family back home in the<BR>central region of Sine Saloum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since her arrival in Dakar the young woman has worked for local<BR>people as well as foreigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Local people give us a hard time and pay very small wages&quot;,<BR>Khady said. &quot;With them, count yourself lucky if you make more than<BR>15,000 CFA francs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a Lebanese or a &quot;Niak&quot; (pejorative name for non-Senegalese<BR>Africans) one can earn between 20,000 CFA francs and 30,000 CFA<BR>francs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a white household, one can easily make 40,000 CFA francs or<BR>more, plus health coverage &quot;specially when you have a work<BR>certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the local employers of these workers confirmed wage<BR>disparities exist, in spite of an existing law which spells out<BR>the minimum wage and other entitlements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who land in households with an average income of 150,000<BR>CFA francs are generally underpaid, even if they live and eat with<BR>the family free of charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This morning, Khady is seating close to Ndeye Lena, a 17-year<BR>old girl who just dropped out of secondary school. This is Lena's<BR>first morning at the Point E labor market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She preferred to quit school to earn some money so as to help<BR>her younger brothers and sisters complete their schooling. Once<BR>employed, Lena hopes to enrol for evening classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ndeye Lena claims hard work does not scare her because as an<BR>African girl from a poor family she is used to house chores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She might soon find out how challenging it is to be a house<BR>servant in Senegal. The job entails washing and cleaning, usually<BR>from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then a scanty dish of rice crust is offered to the tired young<BR>woman. This is usually eaten in a dark corner of the kitchen, some<BR>distance from employers enjoying their lavish meals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lena will soon discover that there is a world of difference<BR>between being a domestic worker and washing and cleaning in one's<BR>own home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fa, another of Khady companions, narrates how she has had<BR>several sad experiences with her employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You cannot eat with the members of the family as if you are<BR>not clean enough although you are the one cooking what they eat,&quot;<BR>she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sometimes the maid is only fed on leftovers, says Fa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> House-servants are not supposed to fall sick and have sick<BR>leave, she said. They are often branded thieves, abused and even<BR>sometimes beaten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Raky Kane, a programme officer at the International Labour<BR>Office in Dakar says &quot;the problem for maids is that they are not<BR>protected by a work contract.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For now the government has decided that when payment resumes<BR>only 19,127 civil servants will get their cheques. It did not,<BR>however, say how long the salary suspension will take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measure follows an undertaking given to the International<BR>Monetary Fund early September that the government will maintain<BR>low salary levels over the next three years, trim the civil<BR>service, privatise state-owned businesses and broaden the tax<BR>base.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - Fears are being voiced in defense<BR>circles here over statements by local politicians that South<BR>Africa should be in the forefront of international efforts to<BR>isolate Nigeria over her recent execution of nine minority rights<BR>activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A report by the defense correspondent of a Johannesburg daily,<BR>The Star, says South Africa is unable to take up any military<BR>role, which will almost certainly be a crucial part of the<BR>envisaged blockade of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior military officers have pass on this message to the<BR>government in the past week, the report said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They have told cabinet ministers, &quot;the report adds, &quot;of the<BR>huge logistical problems which would face the nation, and<BR>therefore the future of any pan-African force used in an attempt<BR>to isolate Nigeria. The cost to this country in terms of money and<BR>manpower has also been spelt out&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;To place a stranglehold on Nigeria would mean mounting a huge<BR>land, sea and air blockage -- and that is where South Africa may<BR>just have to draw back from active participation,&quot; the report<BR>adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The key South African force needed for any blockade of Nigeria,<BR>according to the military, would be the navy, one of the three<BR>biggest on the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But navy chief Vice-Admiral Robert Simpson-Anderson has made it<BR>clear on several occasions that without ships it was impossible to<BR>assist with peace enforcement duties or effectively patrol South<BR>Africa's own economic enforcement zone, let alone help to maintain<BR>regional security or mount naval blockades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa also does not have the maritime air support needed<BR>to lend support to the navy -- even in our own waters, the report<BR>says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, National Defense Force chief Gen George Meiring<BR>recently told diplomats that while South Africa was training its<BR>own troops to possibly participate in United Nations peace<BR>enforcement operations on the continent, the problem of logistics<BR>was uppermost in his mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This scenario&quot;, the newspaper report concludes, &quot;is one of the<BR>reasons why South Africa's defense establishment is waiting keenly<BR>for policy statements from the politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They hope the order to join in a blockade will never be given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Disappointed by the decision by Nigerian military rulers to<BR>execute the nine Ogoni activists just as the 53-member<BR>Commonwealth of mostly former British colonies began its summit in<BR>New Zealand, President Nelson Mandela is now campaigning for<BR>Nigeria's international isolation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When rains fall normally, Zimbabwe produces more than 14,000<BR>tons of coffee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shaw said that ZCM was trying to penetrate the United States<BR>coffee speciality industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1994 the United States speciality industry was valued at 1.5<BR>million U.S. dollars and according to a market survey by the<BR>Speciality Coffee Association of America, speciality coffee could<BR>be a five-billion dollar-industry by 1999.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia's opposition political parties, civic<BR>organizations and churces have united for a political showdown<BR>with the government over the method of adopting a new constitution<BR>for this southern African state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The groups are opposed to government plans to have the draft<BR>constitution ratified by parliament which is dominated by the<BR>Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), the ruling party of<BR>President Frederick Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have resolved to stage peaceful demonstrations to force<BR>the government to change its position.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The demonstrations were announced here Saturday night by the<BR>groups who want the constitution adopted by a constituen<BR>assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The goverment argues that ratifying the constitution outside<BR>parliament would be tantamount to the house abdicating its civic<BR>responsibilities as the country's highest law-making body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political analysts say the move by the pro-constituent assembly<BR>groups could be interpreted as a declaration of a vote of noAt the Saturday conference spokesperson for Zambia's<BR>confidence in the government.<BR>traditional chiefs, Chieftainess Nkomeshya made an emotional<BR>appeal to Zambians &quot;not to fear&quot; to challenge the government over<BR>the constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics fear the MMD-dominated parliament could formalise some<BR>of the more controversial clauses contained in the current draft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most controversial involves a provision that only secondThis provision is being challenged as an infringement on<BR>generation Zambians qualify to stand for the presidency.<BR>citizens rights and is generally seen as a ruse to stop former<BR>president Kenneth Kaunda, whose parents migrated from Malawi, from<BR>challenging President Chiluba in the 1996 presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda, Zambia's founding president, ruled Malawi for 27 years<BR>under a one-party dictatorship. He was ousted by Chiluba in the<BR>multiparty elections of Oct. 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health Minister Michael Sata, one of Chiluba's closest<BR>political advisors, told Zambian television Sunday that the MMD<BR>was ready to &quot;fight and throw Kaunda back into the political<BR>dustbin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many observers believe the MMD, which will hold its third<BR>convention Dec. 17, could back out of the political confrontation<BR>over the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently the government suspended legal procedures it had<BR>initiated to deport Kaunda to Malawi. The government claimed he<BR>had obtained his Zambian citizenbship fraudulently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The groups opposed to the government's moves held a two-day<BR>conference to chart additional strategies to reverse its intention<BR>to have the draft constitution endorsed by parliament .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - An international humanitarian organization has<BR>warned of the possibility of another wide-scale bloodbath in<BR>central African, where more than one million people have been<BR>killed in ethnic fighting in the last two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Another disaster could strike Rwanda, or neighboring Burundi,<BR>in the coming months, warned the group, EARTHACTION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Unless there is urgent action by the international community,<BR>many more could die&quot;, EATHACTION, a global coalition for the<BR>environment, peace and justice, said in a statement send to PANA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than half-a-million people, mainly of the minority Tutsi<BR>ethnic group and moderates from the majority Hutu, were massacred<BR>between April and July in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were killed by militias of the majority Hutu population<BR>angered by the death of President Juvenal Habyarima (a Hutu) in a<BR>plane crash on April 6, 1994, in which foul play was suspected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In neighbouring Burundi, which has the same ethnic<BR>configuration, more than 50,000 people have been killed in feuds<BR>since the country's first elected (Hutu) president, Melchior<BR>Ndadaye, was killed in an aborted coup mounted by the Tutsi<BR>dominated army in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Rwanda, the old genocidal regime which was forced to flee<BR>the country last year was re-arming within border refugee camps,<BR>EARTHACTION says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Burundi, ethnically-motivated killings by armed gangs and<BR>sections of the Tutsi-dominated army have become more frequent<BR>everyday. The government is weak and no one is being convicted, it<BR>added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said some countries, including China, France and Zaire were<BR>breaking the UN arms embargo in the area by re-arming elements of<BR>the former government of Rwamda, thereby creating conditions for<BR>yet another mayhem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EARTHACTION urged governments to &quot;press for full enforcement of<BR>the U.N. arms embargo on the former government of Rwanda, and<BR>called for wider deployment of U.N. forces to halt the supply of<BR>arms to extremists in both countries&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Tutsi-led Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) government in<BR>Kigali is pushing for the withdrawal of some 2,000 U.N. peace8.<BR>keepers in the country whose mandate is due to expire on December</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government officials were recently quoted as saying what is<BR>needed now is assistance for national reconstruction and not<BR>troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, EARTHACTION says there are two keys to solving the<BR>seemingly intractable problems in the area -- justice and economic<BR>opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But &quot;Neither justice nor economic opportunity are possible<BR>without international help... without greater commitment from<BR>other governments genocide could begin again in central Africa,&quot;<BR>the organization says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organization calls for stong support to the international<BR>tribunal set up to prosecute the leaders of the Rwandan genocide,<BR>and a new international commission of enquiry into previous<BR>massacres in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These two bodies can play a key role in ensuring that crimes<BR>against humanity do not go unpunished, but they are desperately<BR>short of funds and staff...&quot;, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 50,000 people have been held in prisons for months<BR>awaiting trial for the part they played in the Rwandan killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organization urges rich industrialized countries to<BR>&quot;sharply increase aid to help Rwanda and Burundi build a<BR>functioning and democratic government administration (including a<BR>well-trained, impartial police force and judiciary) and launch<BR>development projects that bring the ethnic groups together to<BR>overcome their poverty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experts say the crisis in Burundi and Rwanda are part of the<BR>colonial legacies afflicting many other African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwanda and Burundi which share a common history, language,<BR>people and culture were part of German East Africa before being<BR>handed over to Belgium after the First World War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Belgians concentrated on educating and empowering the<BR>minority Tutsi, who account for 20 per cent of the population,<BR>over the majority Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tutsi effectively became the priveleged class in both<BR>countries, fuelling resentment from hordes of poor and powerless<BR>Hutus, who overthrew the Tutsi monarch in 1959.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was followed by massacres which forced many Tutsis to flee<BR>into exile in Uganda and other neighboring countries. It is the<BR>sons of these exiles who forcefully returned to Rwanda in 1990 as<BR>the RPF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gen Habyarimana died in a plane crash in Kigali as he returned<BR>from a regional meeting in Tanzania to finalise plans for powerThis touched off the gory killings that outraged the<BR>sharing in Rwanda.<BR>international community.<BR>-0Egypt</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Postcard From Southern Africa: A villager in<BR>Kasama, northern Zambia, could be in line for a national bravery<BR>award -- all for the love of his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ellias Lesa last week grappled with a marauding crocodile that<BR>had dragged his wife into the muddy waters of one of Zambia's<BR>largest rivers, the Chambeshi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was no Tarzan and Jane remake. And Kelya Washeni Lesa, 36,<BR>is now recuperating from multiple leg injuries inflicted by the<BR>reptile.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her husband proudly narrated the couple's ordeal to a visiting<BR>government official from the capital, Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One evening last week the couple went to the Chambeshi river to<BR>draw water. Kelya dipped her bucket into the water and a crocodile<BR>suddenly grabbed her leg and dragged her into the deep waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I jumped on its back and said to myself, 'I will not return<BR>without my wife',&quot; Lesa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lesa struggled with the reptile for more than 30 minutes while<BR>its jaws held tightly onto his wife's leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The crocodile would submerge taking both of us under water,<BR>but realizing that there was still an unwanted load on its back,<BR>it would resurface and go under again while I held tight,&quot; Lesa<BR>said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just as Lesa was beginning to feel exhausted, a canoe floated<BR>by. Kelya grabbed it in desperation while her husband pounded the<BR>reptile with his bare hands. The tug-of-war became too much for<BR>the crocodile. It let go and disappeared into the depths of the<BR>Chambeshi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chambeshi, like many other major rivers in Zambia, is infested<BR>with man-eating crocodiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a popular traditional belief among many Zambian river<BR>people that some traditional medicinemen can turn themselves into<BR>crocodiles to grab other people's wives and terrorize their<BR>neighbors.<BR>-0Africa-at-Large</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Panafrican News Agency<BR>November 15, 1995 (19951115)<BR>by Paul Ejime PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigerian military rulers may have been<BR>surprised by the international storm of protest against Friday's<BR>executions of nine of its citizens for murder, but political<BR>analysts say there had been a systematic build-up to the country's<BR>current isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria had been embroiled in political turmoil since 1993 and<BR>analysts say the hanging of the Ogoni minority leaders, including<BR>author Ken Saro-Wiwa, was &quot;the last straw&quot; that broke<BR>international patience with the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African diplomats in Lagos consider the timing of the<BR>executions &quot;undiplomatic&quot; for a country already under sanctions<BR>and severe pressure from the West to democratize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is unclear why the two-year-old regime of Gen. Sani Abacha<BR>timed the executions to coincide with the summit of the<BR>Commonwealth, and amid calls from critics for Nigeria to be<BR>expelled from the 52-member British-led association.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One possible explanation is that the regime judged the<BR>consolidation of its power at home to be more important than<BR>external criticisms. The other is that the regime was determined<BR>to assert its national sovereignty and demonstrate its wish not to<BR>be dictated to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But analysts add a third explanation: outright miscalculation<BR>on the part of the military rulers of the consequencies that could<BR>follow the executions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one of its toughest measures against a member, the<BR>Commonwealth leaders meeting in Auckland, New Zealand, promptly<BR>suspended Nigeria. It followed this with an ultimatum that Nigeria<BR>free all political detainees and restore democracy within two<BR>years or be expelled from the association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their own reactions, Australia, Britain, South Africa and<BR>United States have recalled their ambassadors in Lagos for<BR>consultations. This is a euphemism for a serious strain in<BR>diplomatic relations. Other Western countries could follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington has extended its existing measures to include a ban<BR>on the sale and repair of military goods and services to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States government also says it will block Nigeria's<BR>requests for debt relief from multinational financial<BR>institutions. Nigerian officials visiting United Nations<BR>headquarters in New York are to be restricted to within a 25-mile<BR>radius (40.2 kilometres) of the organization's headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These measures are intended to isolate Nigeria from the rest of<BR>the world, but they fall short of a U.S. oil embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. buys some 50 per cent of Nigerian oil, the West<BR>African country's main economic lifeline. That is 10 percent of<BR>U.S. oil imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Energy experts say that an oil sanction could also hurt the<BR>Unted States. It is already faced with limited supplies because of<BR>oil embargoes against Libya, Iran and Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Industry sources also say U.S. petroleum firms are not disposed<BR>to oil sanctions against Nigeria, which could push up prices of<BR>the essential product in the world market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, American diplomatic sources cite Nigeria's key<BR>role in the peace process in the war-ravaged West African State of<BR>Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria, with a little over 6,000 troops there, has the largest<BR>contingent of men in the West African Peace Monitoring Group<BR>(Ecomog) in Liberia. It has undertaken to send two more battalions<BR>-- about 1,200 men. The fear is that any action that could provoke<BR>the Abuja government into pulling out of Liberia could spell a<BR>security disaster in the sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Above all Nigeria, with some 98 million people, is a huge<BR>country whose possible devastation by indiscriminate external<BR>pressure could provoke far-reaching consequences beyond the<BR>continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian officials have defended the executions saying they<BR>were within the country's law. They have also criticized the<BR>nation's suspension from the Commonwealth as &quot;baseless and<BR>premeditated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the truth is that no nation, not even Nigeria, can afford<BR>international isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In realization of this, popular opinion in the country is that<BR>since sanctions hurt the ordinary people more efforts should be<BR>made by the government to reach accommodation with the rest of the<BR>world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At issue are the government's human rights commitment and<BR>irreversible steps towards returning the world's largest black<BR>nation to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government officials argue that Nigeria does not have the worst<BR>human rights records in the world. Abacha, they say, has already<BR>announced a 36-month political transition programme terminating in<BR>October 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps some Western countries may have over-reacted, and many<BR>observers counsel dialogue rather than confrontation since a<BR>stable Nigeria is an asset to its citizens and to the world.<BR>-0Zambia</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria Monday ordered home its envoys in the<BR>United States, South Africa and 15 European Union member-countries<BR>in retaliation for the countries' recall of their own diplomats<BR>from Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These countries called back their envoys over last Friday's<BR>execution for murder of nine Nigerian minority leaders, including<BR>author Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Foreign Ministry in the nation's capital, Abuja, said<BR>Nigerian envoys &quot;have no business remaining in their countries of<BR>posting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also in response to Nigeria's suspension from the 53-member<BR>British-led commonwealth, two Nigerian organisations, the official<BR>Radio Nigeria and the Nigerian Television Authority, have<BR>announced suspension of their membership of the Commonwealth<BR>Broadcasting Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian executions have unleashed international<BR>condemnations and sanctions apparently directed against the<BR>military government. These have come from the U.S., Britain and<BR>other members of the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's two-year-old military regime of Gen. Sani Abacha has<BR>defended the hanging of Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues for the 1994<BR>murder of four of their Ogoni kinsmen from oil-rich southeastern<BR>Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government officials have slammed the external condemnations<BR>and sanctions as &quot;unfair&quot; and an interferrence in the country's<BR>internal affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria, with an estimated 98 million people, has diplomatic<BR>missions in some 80 countries after the pruning in the late 1980s<BR>because of economic reasons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ASABA, Nigeria - Hundreds of Nigerians on Wednesday took to the<BR>streets to protest the suspension of their country from the<BR>Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The placard-carrying demonstrators marched to Government House<BR>in the city of Asaba, midwest of the country, where they handed<BR>over their letter of protest to the military administrator of<BR>Delta State, Group Captain Ibrahim Kefas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the placards read 'We Support Abacha's Transition<BR>Programs', 'Mandela Beware, the West is Cunning', 'Mandela You<BR>Have Bitten the Finger that Fed You' and 'Suspension of Nigeria is<BR>International Gang Up.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an address to the military administrator the leader of the<BR>demonstration, Osadume Uwadibie, said the people of Delta State<BR>will support whatever retaliatory measures that the Nigerian<BR>government may take.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that the decision to suspend Nigeria from the<BR>Commonwealth for following and enforcing its domestic law amounted<BR>to undue interference and called on Nigerians to support their<BR>unelected military government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth after Friday's<BR>hangings of the author and minority rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa<BR>and eight other members of his Movement for the Salvation of<BR>Ogoniland (MOSOP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MOSOP led a campaign against environmental damage to Ogoni<BR>territory in south-eastern Nigeria, caused by oil production,<BR>source of the most of the nation's export income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The executions of the nine Ogoni leaders after a special<BR>tribunal had found them guilty of the murder of four eminent Ogoni<BR>opposed to their movement, unleashed international condemnations<BR>and sanctions against Nigeria by the United States and European<BR>Union member-countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These countries and South Africa, which has also barred Nigeria<BR>from a Johannesburg invitational soccer tournament, have recalled<BR>their envoys from Lagos. Nigeria retaliated by recalling its own<BR>envoys from their capitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pro-government demonstrations started Monday in the<BR>northern city of Ilorin and southeastern city of Calabar. They<BR>brought together thousands of people who marched to the state<BR>houses in the capitals. But analysts maintain most Nigerians<BR>oppose the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By Tuesday the protests had spread to the mid-western city of<BR>Benin, and Minna, Kaduna and Katsina in the north. The marchers<BR>accused the Commonwealth of &quot;not taking time to understand events<BR>in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The demonstrators, comprising market women, students and<BR>members of non-governmental organizations, roundly condemned<BR>Nigeria's suspension from the Commonwealth, describing it as<BR>unwarranted interference in the country's internal affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The official Nigerian Television Authority Tuesday night<BR>singled out South Africa for leading the campaign of isolation<BR>against Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It accused President Nelson Mandela's government of trying to<BR>use the anti-Nigeria campaign to get an African seat at the United<BR>Nations Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president of the Manufacturer's Association of Nigeria,<BR>Hassan Adamu, condemned western countries for &quot;scheming&quot; to<BR>isolate Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told journalists in Lagos &quot;the West has shown it is<BR>interested only in taking advantage of every situation to tighten<BR>the noose around the country and to plunge her into more<BR>problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The widows of the four Ogoni men murdered in May 1994, for<BR>whose deaths Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues were convicted and<BR>executed, addressed a newsconference in Lagos Tuesday. They<BR>recounted what they claimed to be their ordeals since their<BR>husbands were slain in a factional feud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In tears, one of them said she and her colleagues had been<BR>ostricized by their community and were living like &quot;lepers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They claimed their plight was overshadowed by the executions of<BR>Saro-Wiwa and the others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saro-Wiwa and MOSOP accused Nigerian authorities and the Anglo&quot;genocide&quot; against the estimated 500,000 Ogonis in south-eastern<BR>Dutch petroleum company Shell of creating environmental havoc and<BR>Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shell, which accounts for the production of some 50 per cent of<BR>Nigeria's estimated two million barrels of crude a day, suspended<BR>operations in Ogoniland after protests against its operations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - Racism in Zimbabwe is still alive and<BR>flourishing 15 years after independence from Britain in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Being white I know them (white racists),&quot; says a human rights<BR>activist, David Coltart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They have this theory that if you want prosperity in a black<BR>country you must be seen to support it. Otherwise they have a low<BR>regard for blacks as a community. They believe no black can ever<BR>do any good.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The smooth transition to Zimbabwe's independence hinged on the<BR>ruling Zimbabwe Africa National Union's policy of reconciliation<BR>which was supposed to heal the racial wounds following years of a<BR>brutal armed struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political analysts are now saying reconciliation as espoused by<BR>President Robert Mugabe's government has failed to produce<BR>positive results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current bone of contention is that while 10 million blacks<BR>account for 94 percent of the population, they control less than<BR>three percent of the economy and only 10 percent of productive<BR>land. The rest is still in the hands of some 100,000 whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When we agreed to wait for some 10 years before reclaiming our<BR>land,&quot; says one accountant in the capital, Harare, &quot;we subtracted<BR>10 years of our independence. Whites used that period to<BR>recolonize us economically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A letter from a Harare resident, Ruzvidzo Mupfudza, published<BR>in a national Sunday newspaper, accused whites of racism and<BR>sparked debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whites accuse blacks of fuelling racial tension, while blacks<BR>accuse whites of having taken advantage of African hospitality to<BR>exploit them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some incidents which broke out during the year seem to have<BR>fueled the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Human rights activist Larry Chakaredza was beaten up in a<BR>Harare nightclub frequented mostly by whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare lawyer Archibald Thandiwa holds strong views on ways of<BR>finding a solution to the question of racism in Zimbabwe. He<BR>thinks &quot;nothing short of a liberation struggle will solve it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He adds: &quot;We cannot talk about the land issue without<BR>castigating the whites or look at indigenous economic empowerment<BR>without arguing with whites.&quot;'<BR>-0Nigeria</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - In his first public statement since Friday's<BR>execution of nine minority-rights leaders, Nigeria's military<BR>ruler called the international condemnations and sanctions against<BR>his regime as &quot;most unfortunate and uncalled for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In recent times, we have observed and seen absolute and<BR>deliberate interferences in our national and internal affairs,&quot;<BR>Gen. Sani Abacha said Wednesday in the northern state of Kebbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha vowed &quot;to do everything possible to maintain the<BR>nation's unity, dignity, stability and integrity.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The British-led 52-member Commonwealth of Nations suspended<BR>Nigeria and gave Abacha's government a two-year ultimatum to<BR>democratize or be expelled. Fifteen European Union member states,<BR>South Africa and the United States recalled their ambassadors from<BR>Nigeria. Abuja retaliated by summoning home its envoys from those<BR>countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States and South Africa also slapped an arms embargo<BR>on Nigeria. South African President Nelson Mandela went further,<BR>saying he would press for oil sanctions against the West African<BR>country. Oil is the nation's main export earner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha's remarks came amid growing pro-government protests in<BR>several parts of Nigeria. The demonstrators are mainly market<BR>women, students and members of non-governmental organizations who<BR>consider the external measures an interference in Nigeria's<BR>internal affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defending the executions, which included author Ken Saro-Wiwa,<BR>Abacha's second in command, Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya, said the<BR>military regime remains committed to the three-year political<BR>transition program announced Oct. 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking Wednesday in the northern city of Katsina, Diya<BR>condemned the Commonwealth's suspension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the military government would implement its programs<BR>with diligence to shame their &quot;detractors and their<BR>collaborators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there appears to be no stop to mounting international<BR>pressure on Nigeria. The European Commission Wednesday proposed a<BR>resolution calling for an arms embargo and the freezing of<BR>Nigerian military officers' European assests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political observers say an oil embargo, which could be painful<BR>for Nigeria, appears unlikely because it also would harm huge<BR>foreign interests there.<BR>-0Zimbabwe</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TRIPOLI, Lybia - Some 16 million Algerians were expected to<BR>vote Thursday in the country's first democratic presidential<BR>election since independance in 1962. According to state Radio<BR>Algeria monitored in Tripoli Thursday, polling stations opened at<BR>8 a.m. local time (0700 GMT), despite threats of violence from<BR>Islamic fundamentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Algerians living abroad cast their ballots Saturday, while<BR>those in the security services voted earlier this week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four presidential candidates are in the race: incumbent<BR>president Gen. Liamine Zeroual; the leader of the Rally for<BR>Culture and Democracy, Said Saadi; the head of the Movement of the<BR>Islamic Society 'HAMAS', Cheikh Mahfoud Nahnah; and the chairman<BR>of the Renovation Party, Noureddine Boukrou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zeroual was the favorite in pre-election poll, conducted by the<BR>Algerian newspaper Al-Watan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The radio reported that about 300,000 policemen, soldiers and<BR>other security agents were guarding the polling sites in response<BR>to threats of violence -- or one for every 4,600 balloters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, scores of international observers from the United<BR>Nations, the Organization of African Unity and the Arab League are<BR>in Algeria as monitors.  Algerian authorities urged voters<BR>in areas with strong Islamist influence to vote in other districts<BR>-- for their safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The advice was directed in particular at residents of the Qasba<BR>neighborhood in Algiers, the Algerian capital, considered a<BR>stronghold of the Armed Islamist Group, GIA, which had threatened<BR>to kill voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GIA has claimed responsibility for thousands of murders in<BR>Algeria and bombings in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A United States-based spokesman of the banned Islamic<BR>Salvation Front, FIS, Anouar Haddam, said his organization will<BR>not recognize the election's outcome. &quot;The armed struggle<BR>continues,&quot; Haddam said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former ruling National Liberation Front and other major<BR>political parties, including the FIS, boycotted the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The FIS, which wants to create an Iranian-type government with<BR>Islamic rules, was poised to win parliamentary elections held in<BR>late 1991 after winning the first round and leading the second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the military-backed interim government that organized<BR>the polls canceled the elections and arrested top FIS leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, various armed fundamentalist groups have blossomed<BR>in Algeria, killing people and bombing public buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Up to 50,000 people, including foreigners and especially French<BR>nationals, were killed in the politically motivated violence. The<BR>French government ordered its nationals to leave Algeria, a former<BR>colony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the FIS took its battle into France, whom it accuses of<BR>financing the regime in Algiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> French authorities believe GIA saboteurs planted bombs in<BR>underground trains in Paris.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BANJUL, Gambia - A speeding car kicked up dust towards the gate<BR>of the British High Commission in The Gambia, 42 Atlantic Road, in<BR>the capital of Banjul. When the red dust settled, 12 people could<BR>be seen clustered against the white gate which marks British<BR>&quot;soil&quot; in The Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All were silently waiting for the new formalities introduced by<BR>the United Kingdom on October 27, 1995. These require intending<BR>Gambian travellers to obtain visas at home prior to departure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The policy change was revealed in a statement which said it was<BR>prompted by the 800 or so Gambians, most in their early 20s, who<BR>left The Gambia following the coup on July 22 last year led by Lt.<BR>Yahya Jammeh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The British High Commission (embassy) stated further that of<BR>all the 800 refugees claims filed by the Gambians &quot;less than ten<BR>were genuine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, the Foreign Office was forced to regulate the mass<BR>entries of Gambians seeking political asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even more people now congregate at the entrance to the High<BR>Commission. The entrance is locked and manned by a tall fellow in<BR>blue uniform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On this day, he ordered the crowd to move back. &quot;Gate Space,&quot;<BR>he barks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His words fell on deaf ears. There was a young man in a Chicago<BR>Bulls tee-shirt with the word Jordan boldly written on it. &quot;Excuse<BR>me,&quot; he said, &quot;I want a form.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For what?&quot; a voice behind a counter replied. &quot;For a visa,&quot; The<BR>Bulls fan answered, somewhat amused by the seemingly obvious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are spikes in the lawn of the entrance, lined by blue<BR>ropes, signifying that visa seekers must line up when waiting. But<BR>that requirement was ignored this day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is hot, let us in,&quot; a light skinned woman with a child<BR>pleaded. The guard turned around, spoke to the voice in the booth<BR>and opened the gate.  The crowd parted and a white Rangegate. There was pushing and shoving. Then an order came from the<BR>Rover exited. After this, the crowd surged towards the closing<BR>booth: &quot;Let only 10 in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The guard in blue uniform obeyed and barked: &quot;Proper order<BR>here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unimpressed, the light skinned lady retorted: &quot;You don't treat<BR>us like this. It is not fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The guard replied with a profanity, the others mediated and<BR>eventually nine people wer allowed through the gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The young man with the Bulls tee-shirt is one of the unlucky<BR>ones who failed to make it in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You know, I want to go to England for further studies,&quot; he<BR>said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asang, the Bulls fan, has just completed his &quot;O&quot; levels (Grade<BR>12 exams) and apparently did very well. He intends to join the 800<BR>or so others who left the country in search of greener pastures<BR>since the coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But getting out of The Gambia is an uphill task, for now he<BR>must make it through the white gates, pass the guard in blue. He<BR>must convince the consulate that his case is genuine. And that he<BR>is not seeking asylum in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asang must gather his information and arrange it as asked on<BR>the form. The paperwork is taxing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An applicant has to pay between 264 and 320 Dalasis (about 25the applicant and length of intended stay.<BR>30 dollars) as &quot;clearance fees&quot;. The amount depends on the age of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This policy change has received mixed feelings within the<BR>country, a British colony until 1965 and which still maintains its<BR>membership of the British-led Commonwealth of Nations, although<BR>military leaders have been told to democratize..<BR>-0Algeria</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Panafrican News Agency<BR>November 17, 1995 (19951117)<BR>by Paul Ejime PANA Staff Correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha,<BR>ended his second year in power Friday with the country in deeper<BR>political trouble and under intensified international pressure<BR>than when he seized control, political analysts here said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abacha regime last week inflamed world opinion by executing<BR>nine Ogoni minority leaders. They included author Ken Saro-Wiwa<BR>who accused the government and the Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell<BR>of environmental genocide against an estimated 500,000 Ogoni.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nine were convicted for the 1994 murders of four Ogoni<BR>chiefs opposed to their movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha, a bespectacled infantry general not given to public<BR>speech even as head of state, took over from an interim<BR>administration installed by former military ruler Gen. Ibrahim<BR>Babangida after Babangida annulled the June 1993 presidential<BR>election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Babangida stepped down on Aug. 26, 1993, during a political<BR>crisis caused by the cancellation of the presidential poll that<BR>international observers had deemed fair. Millionaire-politician<BR>Moshood Abiola claimed victory in the election, then the military<BR>government arrested him on charges of treason. Abiola's case is<BR>still on trial, and the political crisis caused by that election<BR>is far from over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers say the &quot;ill-timed&quot; Nov. 10 executions, which<BR>coincided with the Commonwealth summit in Auckland, New Zealand,<BR>were the last straw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Commonwealth suspended Nigeria and gave the government two<BR>years to democratize or be expelled from the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abacha regime defended its actions, dismissing the<BR>Commonwealth's ultimatum as a premeditated &quot;gang-up&quot; by its<BR>critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the 15 European Union member states, South Africa and the<BR>United States imposed arms embargoes on Nigeria and recalled their<BR>ambassadors the Abacha regime retaliated by summoning home its own<BR>envoys from these countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outraged international community appears unimpressed by the<BR>Abacha government's contention that a legally constituted court<BR>convicted the nine of murder according to the country's laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some Nigerians now consider the international measures against<BR>their country an over-reaction that interferes in their internal<BR>affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Small pro-government demonstrations in several state capitals<BR>denounced the anti-Nigeria campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some Nigerian protesters singled out South African President<BR>Nelson Mandela, accusing him of being &quot;used&quot; by Western countries<BR>and reminding him of Nigeria's key role in the anti-apartheid<BR>struggle in his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, analysts contend the majority of Nigerians are opposed<BR>to the military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The embattled military government is appealing to the patriotic<BR>conscience of Nigerians to see the international campaign as<BR>challenge for them to forge a common front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a test,&quot; said senior military officer Maj. Gen.<BR>Abdulkarim Adisa. &quot;This is a time to know who our true friends<BR>are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, Nigeria has escaped an oil embargo that could cut off<BR>the country's main economic lifeline. Oil is the main export<BR>earner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The huge interests of multinational corporations in Nigeria,<BR>vulnerable to such sanctions, appear to be the only restraint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even without an oil embargo, analysts say Nigeria can't<BR>take on the whole world or afford international isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abacha regime plans to continue its three-year political<BR>transition program ending in October 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After two years in power, Abacha still has daunting challenges,<BR>including the nation's troubled economy and unresolved political<BR>problems at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's former leader, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, his former<BR>deputy, Maj. Gen. Musa Shehu Ya'ardua and 38 other people are<BR>currently serving various jail terms. They were convicted in July<BR>for trying to overthrow Abacha in March.<BR>-0Ghana</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TRIPOLI, Libya - Algeria's opposition Movement for the Islamic<BR>Society, known as Hamas, Thursday evening contested initial<BR>results of the country's presidential election announced on state<BR>radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Early results, announced by radio monitored in Tripoli, gave<BR>the incumbent President Liamine Zeroual 68.54 percent of the<BR>vote.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Hamas candidate, Cheikh Mahfoudh, received 25 percent, and<BR>the Rally for Culture and Democracies candidate, Said Saadithe,<BR>won 13 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The results are false because many of our supporters were<BR>either threatened or arrested,&quot; the Hamas spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Islamic Salvation Front, FIS, said from abroad the<BR>elections would not resolve Algeria's political crisis. FIS wages<BR>a terror campaign against authorities in Algeria. The movement's<BR>representative in the United States, Anouar Haddam, said the<BR>government's claim of a 75 percent voter turnout was grossly<BR>exaggerated. It said only 30 percent of eligible voters made it to<BR>the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, FIS said it would not recognize the election's<BR>outcome. FIS, which wants to create an Iranian-type government<BR>with Islamic rules, was poised to win parliamentary elections held<BR>in late 1991 after winning the first round and leading the second.<BR>However, the military-backed interim government that organized the<BR>polls canceled the elections and arrested top FIS leaders. Since<BR>then, various armed fundamentalist groups have blossomed in<BR>Algeria, killing people and bombing public buildings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - There has been a significant drop in<BR>estimates of drought relief food needs for Southern African<BR>Development Community countries suffering from another devastating<BR>drought, the regional early warning unit says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwe-based unit said the region's emergency food<BR>requirements in 1995/96 dropped from an initial forecast of 7.1<BR>million tons to 3.9 million tons of aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SADC is an economic grouping of 12 countries, all of them<BR>except Mauritius in drought-prone southern Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reduction in food needs in the region was due largely to a<BR>change in South African estimates. The shortfall there had dropped<BR>from 3 million tons to 532,000 tons, the unit said in a report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SADC said South Africa's revised figures where a result of<BR>factors including a 700,000-ton decrease in consumption estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was also the reduction in cereal stocks by 1.3 million<BR>tons, to be carried forward to the next season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tanzania, which expected a shortfall of 444,000 tons, was now<BR>predicting a surplus of 116,000 tons, while Zambia had dropped its<BR>requirement by 260,000 tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for Zimbabwe the shortfall had risen, with harvest figures<BR>falling 116,000 tons below original estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although South Africa would have to import staple white maize<BR>for domestic consumption it had excess yellow maize for export to<BR>other countries in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All SADC countries were, however, expected to import wheat,<BR>with the greatest shortfalls of 242,000 tons and 427,000 tons in<BR>Zimbabwe and South Africa, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, there was general concern within SADC over the poor<BR>response from the international community to the appeal for food<BR>aid made in June this year. Only 476,000 tons of food aid was<BR>pledged by mid-August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Greater reliance would have to be placed not only on strategic<BR>grain reserves but on commercial imports which would be<BR>detrimental to the region's economic adjustment programmes,&quot; the<BR>unit said.<BR>-0Lesotho and South Africa</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KIGALI, Rwanda - Still shattered by the sight of skulls of<BR>massacre victims in a Rwandan church, former U.S. President Jimmy<BR>Carter Monday expressed hope that forthcoming talks in Cairo will<BR>bring lasting peace to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carter announced in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, that the<BR>government here had officially agreed to participate in the<BR>summit next week to resolve the crises in the so-called Great<BR>Lakes region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr.Carter, who will be the summit's chief mediator, said he<BR>hoped the meeting would encourage the quick return of genuine<BR>Rwandan refugees and an end to intimidation within refugee camps<BR>in Tanzania and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An estimated two million Rwandan Hutu refugees have been<BR> living in camps in Rwanda and Tanzania since the massacres which<BR>followed the death of President Juvenal Habyariamana in a plane<BR>crash on April 6, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the meeting will discuss ways of stopping the flow of<BR>arms to the refugee camps. He hoped the discussions will build up<BR>support for the Arusha International Tribunal which is expected to<BR>try the perpetrators of genocide in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other mediators at the summit will be former Tanzanian<BR>President Julius Nyerere and Archbishop Desmond Tutu of Cape Town,<BR>South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit is expected to be attended by the presidents of<BR>Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carter told journalists that among the sights that stuck in his<BR>mind during his two-day visit in Rwanda were the skulls he saw at<BR>the altar of Ntarama Parish Church near Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least 5,000 people were butchered at Ntarama church during<BR>last year's genocide in which up to one million people, mostly<BR>from the minority Tutsi ethnic group and moderates from the<BR>majority Hutu were massacred by extremists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Remains of the dead are still inside the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carter said that representatives of non-government<BR>organizations and human rights groups had confirmed to him that<BR>conditions inside Rwanda were ripe for the return of refugees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambian wildlife officials have created<BR>additional incentives for villagers living near game management<BR>areas and national game parks who provide information that leads<BR>to the arrest and punishment of poachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Parks and Wildlife Service officials said at the<BR>departmental headquarters outside the capital Lusaka Monday that<BR>the department had introduced a 20,000 Zambian kwacha (about<BR>USD21) &quot;reward&quot; to anybody helping them catch poachers and<BR>retrieve fire-arms used for poaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Departmental spokesman, Ternnyson M'simuko, said that there had<BR>been a marked increased in poaching levels, particulary in the<BR>country's western region due to famine caused by recurrent<BR>drought.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambian wildlife officials also attribute the upsurge in<BR>poaching in the area to an illicit trade in fire-arms involving<BR>former Namibian freedom fighters as well as former rebel Unita<BR>fighters in neighbouring Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 84 guns, including AK 47 assault rifles, were displayed<BR>Monday by the officials who said they had confiscated them from<BR>poachers in the Western province over the past two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sixty-one elephant tusks were also caught in the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The officals meanwhile reported Monday that there had been a<BR>slight increase in the number of elephant in the countrysince its<BR>ban on the trade in ivory under the Convention on Trade in<BR>Endangered Species (Cites).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are currently an estimated 18,000 to 22,000 elephant<BR>herds in Zambia, from an estimated 1 million about 10 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia is a popular destination for international poachers,<BR>particulary for the elephant and rhino which are killed for their<BR>tusks and horns believed to be sold on the black market in the<BR>Middle East and Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tusk is said to be mainly used for ornamental articles by<BR>rich Arab sheikhs. In Asia, the rhino horn is said to be used in<BR>the preparation of aphrodisiacs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of rampant poaching, the black rhino, indegenous black<BR>rhino, could almost be extinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only known rhino population now are six &quot;white rhinos&quot; at<BR>the Livingstone park in the southern tourist town of Livingstone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They had been imported from South Africa several years ago and<BR>have all since been dehorned as protection against poachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambian wildlife officials run a wildlife management scheme<BR>under which residents near game management areas share game fees<BR>paid by tourists and from the sale of trophy with the government.<BR>This is designed to encourage them to take keen interest in<BR>wildlife conservation.<BR>-0Rwanda</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia's central bank closed the<BR>privately-owned Commerce Bank Wednesday and placed it under<BR>receivership after it ran out of cash to meet depositors demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is also being punished for failing to replenish its<BR>central bank clearing account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The closure brought to three in a period of six months the<BR>number of privately-owned commercial banks in the country that<BR>have<BR>shut down due to liquidity problems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country's fourth largest bank, the Meridien BIAO, was<BR>shut in May followed by Africa Commercial Bank which was closed<BR>in November for similar reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bank of Zambia has appointed Delloite and Touche to<BR>act as receivers for Commerce Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commerce Bank branches in the Copperbelt region<BR>were earlier this week reported to be issuing bad cheques. In the<BR>capital, Lusaka, some government workers who receive their<BR>salaries<BR>through Commerce Bank were unable to get their money when the bank<BR>ran out of cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government announced last week new stringent measures<BR>to protect depositors in the wake of instability in the banking<BR>sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the country's new banking regulations banks<BR>and financial institutions will now have to deposit half of their<BR>profits in a reserve account before declaring dividends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This measure, instituted by Finance Minister Ronald<BR>Penza, is intended to ensure the liquidity of any bank<BR>matches its paid-up equity capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Penza also raised the minimal investment capital for<BR>setting up a bank from 1.25 million U.S. dollars to 2.5 million<BR>dollars with effect from June 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Financial analysts have blamed low investment capital in<BR>the banking business and a depressed financial market as<BR>responsible<BR>for most of the banks'liquidity problems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - A government circular announcing<BR>an imminent purge in Nigeria's bloated Federal Civil Service has<BR>unleashed fears among workers as labour unions prepare to oppose<BR>the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chairman of the Federal Civil Service Commission<BR>(FCSC), Shuaib Kazaure, has however, said that jobs will &quot;not<BR>be casually swept away&quot; and that there will be no<BR>&quot;witch-hunt.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But some government workers who still remember a similar<BR>exercise in 1975 when thousands of civil servants were<BR>retrenched appear unconvinced by these assurances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kazaure speaking Wednesday after the government circular<BR>early this month said &quot;we are not going to witch-hunt, all we<BR>are doing is a kind of cleaning up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia's main opposition, the<BR>United National Independence Party (UNIP) of former president<BR>Kenneth Kaunda, has called for an international commission to<BR>probe President Frederick Chiluba's disputed citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP secretary-seneral Sebastian Zulu said Wednesday<BR>the commission should comprise Commonwealth, United Nations<BR>representatives and Zambians representing the media, the<BR>judiciary, the law association, the church and non-governmental<BR>organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The independent daily, The Post, published Monday<BR>details of what it claimed were Chiluba's birth certificate. The<BR>details showed he was born in Zaire, of Zairean parents.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is contrary to the president's own and his<BR>relatives' conflicting versions. The president says he was born<BR>on the Zambian Copperbelt while some of his relatives say he was<BR>born in the northern Luapula province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a simialr statement Wednesday president of the<BR>opposition Alliance for National Reconstruction Rev. Alfred<BR>Sayila also urged a similar probe and advised Chiluba's ruling<BR>Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) to bar him from<BR>contesting the party's presidency at a forthcoming national<BR>convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zambia Democratic Congress, a break-away<BR>faction of the MMD, said Tuesday it was considering legal options<BR>against the president for alleged fraud in his acquisition of<BR>Zambian citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP claimed Wednesday that it had been aware since 1968<BR>that Chiluba had lied about his birth and the identity of his<BR>parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post alleged Monday that both the president's mother<BR>and father were Zaireans who met and married on the Zambian side<BR>of the border. His mother reportedly returned to Zaire to prepare<BR>for delivery and gave birth to Chiluba on June 12, 1944, at<BR>Chibambo mission in Zaire's southern Shaba region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba's relatives said Monday they would sue The Post<BR>for lying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The newspaper also alleged Tuesday that defence minister Ben<BR>Mwila, who is Chiluba's uncle, was also Zairean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citizenship has gained critical importance in Zambian<BR>politics with Chiluba's MMD having sponsored a draft constitution<BR>that stipulates that only second generation Zambians can stand for<BR>the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former president Kenneth Kaunda, who had Malawian parents<BR>and wants to challenge Chiluba in Zambia's 1996 presidential<BR>election, has vowed to fight to &quot;the bitter end&quot; to block<BR>adoption of the clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post has since 1994 claimed the Zambian<BR>president was born in Zaire and that he had a forged junior<BR>secondary school certificate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political analysts think Chiluba's options will now<BR>almost certainly include dropping the controversial citizenship<BR>clause in the draft constitution. This will mean he will almost<BR>certainly have to face Kaunda in the 1996 elections.<BR>-0Nigeria</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. -- Pressure from around the world is mounting<BR>on the Nigerian government following the death sentence handed<BR>down earlier this week for Nigerian activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and his<BR>colleagues.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the major immediate focus is on saving the lives of the<BR>condemned activists, Nigerian pro-democracy campaigners also<BR>stress that pressure on the regime needs to be escalated for<BR>release of all detainees and for an end to military rule.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The death sentences announced today on Ken Saro-Wiwa and other<BR>Ogoni activists are simply outrageous, and represent not only a<BR>continuation of the oppressive nature of this regime, but also its<BR>latest manifestation of a new tendency to draw attention to itself<BR>to elicit legitimacy: death sentences, world appeals for clemency,<BR>commutation, relief from international pressure?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 30 and 31 October 1995, after what Amnesty International<BR>believes to have been politically-motivated and unfair trials, the<BR>nine people named above were convicted of murder and sentenced to<BR>death by hanging. Amnesty International considers at least two of<BR>them - Ken Saro-Wiwa and Dr Barinem Kiobel - to be prisoners of<BR>conscience, imprisoned for the non-violent expression of their<BR>political views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nine were convicted in connection with the murder of four<BR>Ogoni leaders by an angry crowd in May 1994, for which the<BR>leadership of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People<BR>(MOSOP) was pronounced responsible by the authorities the day<BR>after the murders. MOSOP, a non-governmental organization in<BR>Rivers State, southeast Nigeria, has been targeted by the<BR>government in recent years for its non-violent campaign against<BR>environmental damage by oil companies and for more autonomy for<BR>the Ogoni ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The defendants were detained incommunicado and without charge<BR>for at least eight months before being charged; several were<BR>alleged to have been tortured or ill-treated in military custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were convicted in two trials conducted simultaneously by a<BR>Civil Disturbances Special Tribunal in Port Harcourt, Rivers<BR>State. This court, which falls outside the normal judicial system,<BR>was appointed by the military government especially to try these<BR>cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trials contravened Nigerian and international standards for<BR>fair trial to which the Nigerian government is committed, in<BR>particular the right to fair trial by an independent court and the<BR>right of appeal to a higher and independent jurisdiction. The<BR>Tribunal has shown itself to be neither independent of government<BR>control nor impartial. The Federal Military Government has<BR>controlled every aspect of the case: the arrests, investigations,<BR>prosecution, appointment of the tribunal and the progress of the<BR>trial itself. Two key prosecution witnesses alleged that they were<BR>threatened and bribed to give false evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The defence lawyers withdrew from the trials in June and July<BR>1995 in protest at continued bias by the Tribunal in favour of the<BR>prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ken Saro-Wiwa, environmental activist and leader of the Ogoni<BR>people in the Niger Delta, and nine others were sentenced today to<BR>death by a Nigerian military tribunal. Saro-Wiwa, recipient of the<BR>Goldman Environmental Prize and nominated for the Nobel Peace<BR>Prize, leads the struggle of the Ogoni people against Shell Oil,<BR>whose operations have contaminated their land and resources for<BR>more than three decades. Last year, Saro-Wiwa was jailed in<BR>connection with the murder of four Ogoni leaders, which human<BR>rights groups have said are false charges. Amnesty International<BR>has declared Saro-Wiwa a Prisoner of Conscience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four year peaceful campaign of the Ogonis has been met by<BR>repression from the Nigerian military dictatorship leading to the<BR>deaths of more than 1,000 Ogoni. Shell Oil has also been<BR>implicated in the violence that has transcended this region.<BR>According to human rights groups, Shell has used military<BR>personnel to defend their oil operations, resulting in some<BR>injuries and deaths. Since 1958, Royal Dutch Shell has extracted<BR>US $30 billion in oil from Ogoniland, but the Ogoni people still<BR>lack basic services, healthcare, and jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACTIONS TO TAKE:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Contact the Clinton Administration and ask that the<BR>Administration come out strongly against this sentencing and<BR>demand the release of Saro-Wiwa and the others. The United States<BR>has political pull with Nigeria, particularly given that the U.S.<BR>consumes 70 percent of Nigeria's oil.<BR>Specifically, we are asking that Clinton call General Abacha of<BR>Nigeria, denouncing the verdicts and warn that if these people are<BR>put to death, it will have profound political ramifcations. Fax a<BR>letter or call: Anthony Lake, Assistant to the President for<BR>National Security Affairs, National Security Council, Washington,<BR>DC 20504, tel: 202-395-3000, fax: 202-456-2883</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Send a letter to General Abacha, the military ruler of<BR>Nigeria, asking for Saro-Wiwa's immediate release, citing the<BR>international condemnation this sentencing has received. Fax<BR>letter to: General Sani Abacha President of the Federal Republic<BR>of Nigeria c/o The Nigerian Ambassador to the United States<BR>Nigerian Embassy, 1333 16th Street, NW Washington, DC 20036 fax:<BR>202-775-1385</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Send a letter to Shell denouncing their role in the Ogoni<BR>situation and asking for Shell to come out strongly for the<BR>release of the wrongly accused.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Working seven days a week will help gold mines<BR>survive in the medium term -- but gold mining is in decline, says<BR>Amgold chairman Clem Sunter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gold mining, once the mainstay and still a central pillar of<BR>the South African economy, is in what Sunter calls &quot;managed<BR>decline&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Industrial unrest and public holidays were generally blamed for<BR>bad gold mining results in the second quarter of this year, but<BR>the results focused attention on the malaise in gold mining as<BR>well as the continuing importance of gold to South Africa's<BR>economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The various mining houses have reported their results for the<BR>third quarter. Unlike the second quarter, which was uniformly<BR>disastrous, third quarter results proved a mixed bag, with Amgold,<BR>among other mining groups, showing some improvement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sunter warns against looking at one quarter's figures in<BR>isolation. He uses a characteristically graphic metaphor to<BR>describe the plight of South African gold mining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We were like a 747 flying at 30 000 feet, in the early 80s to<BR>the mid-80s, when the gold price was coming down from $600 to<BR>$400.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If you hit an air pocket in a quarter you reduced your margins<BR>slightly. and, OK, you made less profit, but you still made a very<BR>healthy profit. Now we're flying at 500 feet. You hit an air<BR>pocket and you immediately run into a loss situation. We did that<BR>at Freegold in the previous quarter. And when you make a loss on<BR>revenue of R1-billion for a quarter its alarming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And that is why we concentrated on trying to turn Freegold<BR>around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sunter pinpoints the problem: despite extensive exploration<BR>over the last 15 years, using sophisticated techniques, Amgold has<BR>found no new major gold field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new gold finds have been in the gaps between gold fields<BR>and near existing mines. And apart from one or two exceptions like<BR>Moab, for which Amgold is putting a shaft down adjacent to Vaal<BR>Reefs in the South East, those deposits tend to be lower grade<BR>and would require a gold price of say $450 to $500 in today's<BR>money -- for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You would have to have a confidence that the gold price had<BR>moved to a new higher plateau.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One should never say never in prospecting and there could<BR>still be a major gold field to be uncovered, but working on<BR>probabilities one would say we're into the game of exploiting as<BR>efficiently as possible the remaining gold from existing mining<BR>areas and areas not viable at the current gold price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Given that all mines start with the sweeter grades and<BR>gradually work down to the lowest grade portions, we are in a<BR>state of managed decline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gold production has already almost halved from the 1000 tons a<BR>year achieved in 1970 to around 550 tons of gold now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think it is inevitable that it will continue down from 550<BR>tons. And that is difficult to manage because of the 'stepped<BR>function' of overheads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sunter explains that when gold production on a particular shaft<BR>falls below a certain level, unless a quantum of overheads is shut<BR>down, that reduced level of production does not cover the cost of<BR>shaft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So if production falls, the rand per kilogram cost of the mine<BR>can actually rise because overheads are not being shed at the same<BR>time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of Amgold's old shafts have fairly uniform grades. If they<BR>do not cut the mustard, they will have to be closed. There has<BR>been speculation that as many as 50 000 jobs might be in jeopardy<BR>at Anglo American mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sunter is cautious. Out of 33 shafts, around a third are<BR>&quot;endangered&quot;, although Sunter is at pains to point out that the<BR>situation can be changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the things that will change the picture is Full Calendar<BR>Operations (Fulco).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sunter is on record as having said at the beginning of the year<BR>that gold mining must be one of the only industries in the world<BR>with 275 working days out of 365.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His warning then, that costs would exceed revenue by the second<BR>quarter if something was not done, have been borne out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've had a fairly flat price this year, costs have continued<BR>to escalate in rand/kg terms and the margin has been eliminated on<BR>many of the mines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Will Fulco not merely shorten the life of the mine? Sunter<BR>emphasises it will do the opposite. Fulco will lower the pay load<BR>because of the increased economies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The grade of the ore you can mine can actually drop and you<BR>can bring into play a greater proportion of the ore body than if<BR>you had stayed on the present 11-shift ortnight. By mining seven<BR>days a week you can actually increase the amount of gold you get<BR>out of a particular ore body.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fulco has been virtually negotiated with the workers, although<BR>the National Union of Mineworkers still has to give its<BR>imprimatur. &quot;They seem prepared to allow negotiations to proceed<BR>on a shaft-by-shaft basis, even though they won't give their<BR>agreement at the centre. All the mining groups are negotiating<BR>Fulco at shaft level&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sunter cautions that Fulco is not a panacea. Many old shafts<BR>are not appropriate for Fulco because only mining pillars and bits<BR>and pieces are left to mine. Fulco mainfly benefits new shafts<BR>where mining can continue uninterruptedly on ore bodies, such as<BR>with Freddies No 1 shaft at Freegold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moving the appropriate shafts in Amgold's portfolio to Fulco<BR>will absorb labour from some of the other shafts which are in<BR>decline. In terms of slowing the rate of descent of South Africa's<BR>gold production Fulco is important, but unless a major new gold<BR>field is found, there will not be a major turnaround in South<BR>African gold production</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fulco itself, could probably pre-empt a drop of 10 percent to<BR>15 percent in gold mining production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given that fixed overheads constitute around 75 percent to 80<BR>percent of mine costs (labour constitutes around 50 percent ),<BR>the marginal costs of working an extra 90 shifts a year is fairly<BR>low, although there will be additional labour, as a roster system<BR>will be in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sunter conservatively estimates that the additional gold will<BR>cost 25 percent less to mine. He notes that Fulco is only one part<BR>of the solution to productivity improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;To really transform prospects, we have to find either a higher<BR>dollar price of gold, that is $420, or change our management<BR>systems to produce a more participative approach&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Elandsrand, he said a &quot;Wheels of Change&quot; initiative with<BR>different components, such as multi-tasking in the stope teams,<BR>leaves a good part of the handling of tasks to the team's<BR>discretion, putting more of the decision-making in the hands of<BR>the people at the rock face. This has led to increases in<BR>productivity of 30 to 50 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vaal Reefs No 10 shaft, he adds, has also gone in for modern<BR>participative management systems. Bonus systems, which pass part<BR>of productivity improvements back financially to the employee,<BR>also help. Yet in the end, barring the discovery of a major gold<BR>field, gold mining will decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sunter says Fulco might mean that the 30 to 35 percent<BR>contribution of gold to South Africa's foreign exchange earnings<BR>remains for a while longer, but the country must start<BR>diversifying now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa must move further away from dependence on a single<BR>foreign exchange earning commodity than it has already, and<BR>towards manufactured exports, which have higher margins and are<BR>more sustainable than the gold, which is finally, it seems,<BR>running out.<BR>-0South Africa</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>November 3, 1995 (19951103)<BR>by Karen Harverson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Depending on whom you believe, South Africa's<BR>deal to store and trade Iranian oil has fizzled out -- or it has<BR>just been suspended pending the outcome of an environmental study<BR>on the risks of increased tanker traffic to Saldanha Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two weeks ago Business Day reported that the deal had<BR>floundered over Iran's refusal to offer South Africa an<BR>acceptable cut in trading profits. It quoted overseas sources<BR>which claimed the deal was &quot;dead in the water&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Strategic Fuel Fund (SFF) general manager Kobus van<BR>Zyl is adamant that the deal -- which could have earned South<BR>Africa R50-million a year in profits -- is only &quot;temporarily<BR>suspended&quot; and has not been scrapped.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The storage agreement has been signed. The joint venture<BR>trading agreement must still be signed although all the main<BR>aspects of the deal have been agreed upon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that the deal was suspended because the South African<BR>government insisted that the outcome of the environmental study<BR>be made a suspensive condition of the contract. &quot;The Iranians are<BR>naturally upset about this late development but both parties have<BR>to respect it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Industry sources claim Iran's initial interest in the deal was<BR>fuelled by its urgent need to find storage for its oil which was<BR>piling up because of United States sanctions against the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another benefit is the strategic position of the Saldanha tank<BR>farm which is convenient for the African, South American and north<BR>west European markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SFF's deal with Iran entails both storing Iranian oil and<BR>trading it -- and the storage agreement will apparently not go<BR>ahead without the trading aspect being tied in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A storage deal based on a storage fee has never been discussed<BR>and is presently not under consideration by the SFF,&quot; says Van<BR>Zyl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iran's apparent reluctance to conclude a satisfactory joint<BR>venture trading agreement with South Africa may indicate that its<BR>need to store oil is not as desperate as once thought or even that<BR>it no longer has the oil available to place in storage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In any event, the deal won't get the go-ahead before the<BR>outcome of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research's<BR>(CSIR) environmental impact assessment (EIA) study which seems<BR>unlikely to be completed earlier than mid-1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week the CSIR released a Background Information Document<BR>to some 340 affected or interested parties, inviting comment on<BR>the proposed process and on the issues which need to be addressed<BR>by the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Comment must be submitted by mid-November, following which a<BR>scoping report will be published describing the agreed process of<BR>the EIA, the viable project alternatives to be assessed and the<BR>key issues to be taken into account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thereafter, specialist studies will be undertaken on those<BR>issues identified in the scoping phase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally a documented report will be drafted based on the<BR>findings of the studies and the SFF will then decide if it is to<BR>proceed with plans to expand operations at Saldanha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The benefits to South Africa of the Iran deal -- besides the<BR>estimated R50-million trading profit -- include improving the<BR>utilisation of an under-utilised asset and using Iran's crude oil<BR>as collateral for export trade to that country from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A deal with Iran could also result in a reduction of South<BR>Africa's strategic oil stocks below the target of 35-million<BR>barrels, thus releasing more than $250- million for use by the<BR>government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present, South Africa has 53-million barrels of crude oil<BR>stockpiled compared to its highest level of 150-million barrels<BR>in mid-1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SFF plans to reduce the 36-million barrels at Ogies to 10to 25-million, thus reaching its target of 35-million barrels.<BR>million barrels and increase the 16-million barrels at Saldanha<BR>&quot;The present rate of reduction is very low (about 700 000 barrels<BR>a month) and could take about 25 months to achieve,&quot; says Van<BR>Zyl.<BR>-0South Africa</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>November 3, 1995 (19951103)<BR>by Louise Asmal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - THE BLACK DIASPORA by Ronald Segal (Faber &amp;<BR>Faber, R135)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This extraordinary compendium attempts to compress within less<BR>than 500 pages not only a description of the trade in human beings<BR>from Africa to the colonies of the various European powers, but<BR>also an account of the fate of their descendants up to the present<BR>day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resulting book is dense with facts and figures. Indeed, the<BR>author recognises in the preface that the task is virtually<BR>impossible, and that really what he hopes to achieve is to spark<BR>off ideas and inspire fresh insights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ronald Segal is a man of huge ability and passion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately the passion hardly surfaces in The Black Diaspora<BR>except in his preface, in which he presents an apologia for his<BR>lack of political correctness in writing as a white man on such a<BR>topic. If his intention was to eliminate all traces of<BR>Eurocentrism, and to present the facts as they emerge from the<BR>history of the diaspora and the impact of that history on the<BR>development of black society outside Africa, then he has<BR>succeeded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To my mind, however, he has succeeded at the cost of producing<BR>a book consisting of an unvarnished catalogue of facts, in which<BR>the sheer accumulation of horror almost anaesthetises feeling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The terrors of the actual slave trade are bad enough. The<BR>cruelty of the colonists is, one is tempted to say, unbelievable,<BR>except that one knows from the recent history of our own country<BR>that no cruelty is taboo when the oppressors treat the oppressed<BR>as less than human.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By contrast, the slaves themselves clung to their hopes of<BR>freedom and often displayed the most extraordinary heroism and<BR>courage in their attempts to achieve it. By and large, slave<BR>rebellions everywhere were far more merciful to their white<BR>oppressors than the oppressors were to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet in spite of this, the slaves themselves and their<BR>descendants were not immune to the moral corruption of racism. The<BR>colonisers themselves were quick to seize on and foster the<BR>divisions between blacks and mulattos, or between blacks and<BR>Indians. The resulting conflicts proved terribly destructive.<BR>Elsewhere numbers of those who seized power, or their successors,<BR>lost their idealism and succumbed to the same greed and<BR>selfishness displayed by the colonisers. As Segal himself says in<BR>his preface, it is the ultimate injustice that &quot;the victims are<BR>so often also victimisers of one another and themselves&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is, I think, a major defect of the book that one is left<BR>with such a depressing picture. Attempts by Segal to alleviate<BR>this with chapters on black art, music, sport, and religion do not<BR>really succeed. The chapters on blacks in America, Brazil<BR>(evidently far from the miracle of a raceless society that is<BR>usually presented), and Britain are equally depressing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly this is partly the result of leading up to a<BR>particular point in time (the book ends in the early 1990s) when<BR>we are past the age of decolonisation and the hope that that<BR>presented. And whether or not the &quot;end of history&quot; has really been<BR>reached, it is true that the world has at present no cohesive<BR>ideology which offers a vision for progress in the future.<BR>Perhaps in South Africa we may aspire to offer an example of race<BR>relations for the future, but South Africa does not fall within<BR>the purview of this book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, there are certainly lessons for us in the experience<BR>of the decolonised countries, which future writers may tease out.<BR>So often in the world of the black diaspora class structure<BR>manifests itself most obviously along colour lines, with the<BR>result that where blacks are at the bottom of the pile, and<BR>visibly so, the class structure becomes more rigid and racial<BR>resentments intensify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paradoxically, it is in one of the societies where this is seen<BR>most clearly that Segal sees most hope for the future. This is<BR>Jamaica, where virtually all those at the top are white, and<BR>growing richer, while virtually all those at the bottom are<BR>black, and growing poorer. Yet here Segal reflects that the<BR>Jamaican &quot;acceptance&quot; of the slave experience produces a &quot;creative<BR>realisation of identity and meaning for the black diaspora&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tantalisingly, this concept is not explored further. One is<BR>tempted to hypothesise that Segal has in mind a colonisers' truth<BR>commission. Whether or not this is so -- and it is not an entirely<BR>novel idea -- it is undoubtedly an idea which merits further<BR>exploration, and the book provides a basis for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Segal's conclusion that the black diaspora provides hope for a<BR>world torn by ethnic divisions also deserves amplification and<BR>exploration. One may not agree that this contribution is<BR>absolutely unique to the black diaspora, but there is indeed a<BR>spirit of freedom and comradeship inherent in all struggles<BR>against oppression that is inspiring, and that in South Africa in<BR>particular we need to hold on to for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the great-grandson of an African slave, Dr WEB du Bois,<BR>who wrote that &quot;the problem of the 20th century is the problem of<BR>the colour line&quot;. This book lays starkly bare the bones of the<BR>problem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A new era of local government dawned for<BR>South Africa this week as millions of voters flocked to the<BR>polls, defying predictions that apathy would keep them at home.<BR>But administrative errors in compiling voters' rolls prevented<BR>countless voters from voting and may cast a shadow over the poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a pattern which played itself out across the country,<BR>thousands of voters arrived at polling stations only to find their<BR>names did not appear on voters' rolls. For them, Wednesday<BR>brought frustration and disappointment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from resulting in artificially low percentage polls,<BR>voters' roll confusion could impact on the fortunes of political<BR>parties, particularly in narrowly contested areas, and raise<BR>questions about the legitimacy of the poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eastern Cape MEC for local government Max Mamase mooted the<BR>possibility of by-elections to address the problem after hundreds<BR>of thousands of voters were turned away from voting stations in<BR>the former Transkei. But Commonwealth technical advisor Brian<BR>McAndrew told Ecna that given the region's transport difficulties,<BR>poor communications and poverty the election effort had been<BR>&quot;bloody brilliant&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Idasa's elections information manager Liz Findlay said the<BR>organisation's Johannesburg office had been flooded with about 14<BR>000 calls from voters complaining about being left off rolls or<BR>being put on the wrong roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We had complaints from every inch of the country,&quot; Findlay<BR>said. Most came from voters in the Greater Johannesburg and Vaal<BR>metropolitan areas: she believed this could explain the low 30<BR>percent turnout predicted for the area early yesterday and said<BR>Idasa would be investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't suspect deliberate sabotage. Perhaps the fault lies<BR>with the computer system or the programmers,&quot; Findlay said. &quot;But<BR>the fact is that many people lost the chance to vote. This will<BR>have an impact politically and could well raise questions of<BR>legitimacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's deputy secretary-general Cheryl Carolus, MP Carl<BR>Niehaus and South African Council of Churches' general secretary<BR>Brigalia Bam were among those who could not vote as their names<BR>did not appear. All had checked they were registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC national elections commission chair Saki Macozoma said the<BR>ANC made a last-ditch request on Wednesday to the Ministry of<BR>Constitutional Development to allow tendered ballots, but this was<BR>refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Macozoma said the problem could explain a low turnout in the<BR>North-West Province, where fewer than one-third of registered<BR>voters cast ballots, although intimidation of farmworkers by<BR>farmowners could also be a factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Transforming local government -- the &quot;hands and feet&quot; of the<BR>RDP -- depends on new councillors and local authorities being seen<BR>as legitimate, hence the need for a high voter turnout. Without<BR>it, new councillors could feel politically insecure about carrying<BR>out one of their key functions: persuading residents to pay for<BR>rates and services. And residents could continue to regard new<BR>structures as illegitimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Voters' roll omissions aside, Macozoma declared the ANC was<BR>&quot;elated&quot; by the way the poll had gone: &quot;At 90 percent of voting<BR>stations things went very well&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Early indications yesterday were that the ANC had made<BR>significant gains in the Western Cape, turning around a coloured<BR>vote that in last year's general election secured the province for<BR>the National Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The ANC did not abandon coloured voters after the previous<BR>election results, despite some voices arguing they were not worth<BR>spending resources on. Instead, we identified the problems and<BR>tried to deal with them and we are now reaping the fruits of that.<BR>It's a triumph for non-racialism.&quot; Macozoma said. Macozoma<BR>criticised the election's managers, however, of a &quot;rule-bound&quot;<BR>approach which meant a lack of flexibility in dealing with<BR>grievances and political problems, ranging from the late arrival<BR>of ballot papers and shortages of paraphernalia, to a polling<BR>station being struck by lightning. &quot;We think the inflexibility in<BR>response to problems has cost us a lot of votes,&quot; Macozoma said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, co-chairman of the elections task<BR>group, said rules governing the election were negotiated by<BR>political parties. The elections had to take place within<BR>&quot;enormous constraints&quot; in terms of time and planning. &quot;We can<BR>organise the elections up to a point and don't claim to be perfect<BR>-- but in the final analysis, everything depends on the cohave had two or three years to prepare properly.&quot;<BR>operation of the political parties. In a perfect world we would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fears of unregistered voters invading polling stations, and of<BR>taxi blockades and political tensions substantially disrupting the<BR>poll, failed to materialise, though isolated incidents caused<BR>voting stations to be closed in some areas, and delays in<BR>delivering ballot papers and equipment caused lengthy hold-ups.<BR>-0Africa-at-Large</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And according to government sources the donor community is<BR>worried about persistent falling living standards and has again<BR>appealed to government to deal with corruption. &quot;Donors have<BR>appealed to government to deal with corruption in high places if<BR>good governance is to be achieved,&quot; the source said but also<BR>revealed that government's response appeared to be an assurance<BR>that it was still sticking to its 1991 manifesto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the government has told the country's donors the<BR>general and presidential elections will be held in September 1996,<BR>it has been revealed.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The scarcity of jobs in the country has made some<BR>Zambians become increasingly ingenious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Edwin Banda, 31, is one of the several Lusaka youths who have<BR>turned to pushing wheelbarrows to eke out a living. Surprised?<BR>Well, you needn't be.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I make up to K6,000 (about US$6) a day transporting goods on a<BR>wheelbarrow,&quot; he revealed in an interview yestarday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From this money which works out to K152,000 (US$150) a month<BR>Banda achieves a lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am able to feed and clothe my family and pay rent for my<BR>one-roomed house in Chibolya,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda, a rather comely fellow, says he has been pushing<BR>wheelbarrows for two years now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I used to work as a guard for AFE Limited,&quot; he explained. &quot;But<BR>one night thieves came and attacked us. I quit the job the<BR>following day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a constricted job market like Zambia's Banda could not just<BR>walk out of one job and hope to get another tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I walked the streets for about three weeks but was unable to<BR>find a job,&quot; he recalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, one day while loitering at Soweto market, he met some<BR>friends with wheelbarrows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I asked them what they were doing with wheelbarrows and they<BR>told me that they were waiting for customers,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn't<BR>understand what they meant until they explained.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Banda, the customers his friends were waiting for<BR>are small-scale traders who buy commodities from wholesalers at<BR>Soweto market for resale at markets within and outside Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They (the small-scale traders) usually don't have money to<BR>book a taxi and resort to us for transportation to the nearest<BR>bus stop,&quot; Banda explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says the charges depend on the distance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Within town it's K600,&quot; Banda said. &quot;From town to the interwe charge up to K3,000.&quot;<BR>city bus stop, it's K1,000 but if the customer has a lot of goods,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He normally operates along Freedom Way which is festooned with<BR>wholesale shops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Most of my clients buy their goods from wholesalers and I park<BR>my wheelbarrow near the wholesale shops,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says pushing a wheelbarrow is a very lucrative business<BR>although some people poke fun at them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They call us Ba Lubilo. he complained. &quot;But it's better to<BR>push a wheelbarrow than just stay at home or worst of all steal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A typical day for Banda starts at 06.00 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I start work at 06.00 hours,&quot; he says &quot;I go to Soweto market<BR>where I rent a wheel barrow at K500 per day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The booming wheelbarrow business has given rise to 'wealthier'<BR>individuals to invest in wheelbarrows which they are renting out<BR>to pushers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as Banda has discovered the high demand from pushers has<BR>escalated the hiring cost per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We pay K500 per day for each wheelbarrow but the owner says he<BR>is going to increase the rent to K1,000 per day from November<BR>20,&quot; Banda moaned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Owner of the wheelbarrows, Benson Mwanza, says he has decided<BR>to increase the rental price because of a &quot;rise in demand&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There has been a marked increase in the number of people who<BR>want to rent my wheelbarrows,&quot; Mwanza said. &quot;So I have also<BR>decided to increase the rentals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says he started his business in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I started with three wheelbarrows,&quot; Mwanza said. &quot;But I have<BR>now got over 100 wheelbarrows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;On a good day I make up to K50,000 per day,&quot; he says. &quot;But on<BR>average I make K30,000.&quot;<BR>-0Zambia</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda has said his party<BR>planned privatisation long before the MMD and it was was intended<BR>to benefit Zambians and not a few ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking in an exclusive interview on Monday this week at his<BR>Kalundu home Kaunda said: &quot;We were going to privatise in the<BR>interest of Zambia and not as a way of enriching ministers as this<BR>government is doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said his party's privatisation programme, which was going to<BR>be in the interest of Zambia and not individuals, started in 1989.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We were going to privatise and that was our policy. In 1989 I<BR>wrote to four Merchant Banks to tender for the privatisation of<BR>our parastatals. Rabson Chongo found one such reply when I<BR>transferred him to the ministry of finance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda described the role merchant banks were expected to play<BR>in the privatisation programme as an interim measure before<BR>selling to workers, managements and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My own view is that these people would takeover the running of<BR>these businesses and as we developed sell them with workers being<BR>involved and no job losses. Government would then be richer,&quot;<BR>Kaunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked to comment on how Chilanga Cement has been privatised and<BR>taken over by a British parastatal the former president wondered<BR>how a government can stop a local parastatal from operating only<BR>to be taken over by a foreign one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You are a parastatal and you are told you cannot do anything<BR>but then you are taken over by another parastatal that is foreign.<BR>That to me is strange thinking,&quot; Kaunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He dismissed speculation that the donor community was<BR>frightened by his return to active politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't think that any High Commissioner or ambassador in<BR>Zambia would be frightened by my return because they know there is<BR>a great deal of difference in governance between Mr Chiluba and<BR>myself,&quot; Kaunda said.<BR>-0Zambia</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - To Nasa Tumwesigye, Director of Public<BR>Prosecutions, Kampala. The Committee to Protect Journalists is<BR>extremely disturbed to learn that Shariat editor Haruna Kanaabi<BR>has been charged with the additional offense of &quot;publishing false<BR>news.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">This charge, coupled with that of sedition, could land<BR>Kanaabi in jail for 10 years if convicted.<BR>As clearly stated in our previous two letters to President<BR>Museveni, CPJ remains resolute in its call for his immediate and<BR>unconditional release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Requests to have Kanaabi, who is in ill health, released on<BR>bail have been consistently denied.

Leica and<BR>the Mother Jones Fund will also honor the work of Ernesto Bazan<BR>and Jose Hernandez-Claire with grants of $7,000 each to continue<BR>their respective projects in Cuba and Mexico.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In conjunction with this year's awards, the Centro de la<BR>Imagen, Mexico's first national museum devoted to photography,<BR>will host an exhibit featuring the work of 23 photographers<BR>representing six years of Fund winners. This retrospective global cross-section of the best documentary photography emerging<BR>-including images by Antonin Kratochvil and Nan Goldin -- is a<BR>at the end of the 20th century. The Mexico City exhibit opens<BR>November 16 and is on display until January 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1995 marks the sixth year of awards sponsored by the Mother<BR>Jones International Fund for Documentary Photography, and the<BR>second year that Leica and the Fund have collaborated to recognize<BR>and award outstanding documentary photography dealing with<BR>important social and political issues. The fund is supported<BR>through foundation grants and through a fine-print program, in<BR>which donors receive museum-quality prints given to the fund by<BR>photographers such as Marc Riboud, Sebastiao Salgado, Mary Ellen<BR>Mark and Gordon Parks. The work of this year's winning<BR>photographers will be published in the January 1996 issue of<BR>&quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American photographer Fazal Sheikh has been photographing the<BR>refugees of Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Mozambique and Rwanda since<BR>1991. His work evolved in response to the media stereotype of<BR>Africa as the &quot;Dark Continent&quot; -- a country full of &quot;wild animals,<BR>exotic people and starving children.&quot; Sheikh's photographs offer a<BR>balance to these journalistic cliches, by providing a &quot;broader<BR>understanding of the complexities of the situation,&quot; and show that<BR>the &quot;people of these African refugee communities are not wholly<BR>unlike you and me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Established in 1989, the Mother Jones International Fund for<BR>Documentary Photography helps ensure that the art and practice of<BR>fine documentary photography remain alive and thriving. The Fund<BR>assists outstanding documentary photographers by providing<BR>competitive grants for sustained, serious study of important<BR>social and political issues and by helping grant recipients<BR>publish and exhibit their work.</SPAN></P>

In the first section, Walker explores the<BR>iconography, attribution, creation and use of a Yoruba<BR>&quot;Olojufoforo&quot; (&quot;owner of the deep-set eyes&quot;) mask from Nigeria.<BR>Such masks, named for their distinct, carved eyeholes, appear at<BR>annual Yoruba festivals called Ijesu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the second section, the focus shifts to a female figure of a<BR>style formerly attributed to the Temne. Ravenhill examines ideas<BR>of style, corpus, alternative attributions and meaning in the<BR>figure, comparing this work to two other &quot;Temne&quot; works on view--<BR>possibly carved by the same artist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nicolls, in a third section, explores a Baga figure known as<BR>&quot;a-Tshol&quot; that combines human and birdlike features. She considers<BR>the figure's original context of use and its prescribed form and<BR>compares it to two other &quot;a-Tshol&quot; figures from the museum's<BR>collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The museum's Department of Education is offering a series of<BR>public programs in conjunction with the exhibition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lunchtime gallery discussions with the curators will be held at<BR>1 p.m. on Nov. 29, Dec. 6 and Dec 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Feb. 3 from 2 to 5 p.m., the curators will present a panel<BR>discussion, titled &quot;What Makes It Good? What Makes It Real? What<BR>Does It Mean?&quot; in which they address their approaches to<BR>determining the quality, authenticity and meaning of the works in<BR>the exhibition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Explorations in Style,&quot; a workshop for children (8 and up),<BR>will be held on Jan. 27. To register for the workshop, call (202)<BR>357-4600 ext. 221.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - It is certain now. One leg of the Africa Rally<BR>Championship will be held in Uganda in February 1996. Both the<BR>International Automobile Federation (FIA) and the governing body<BR>FISA, have already approved the event and the rally drivers are<BR>bustling with enthusiasm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Back home Augustine Byabashaija, of the Uganda Automobile<BR>Association (UAA), that has been in the grave for years has<BR>climbed out and written to the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of<BR>Transport asking him not to sanction any more rallies in Uganda,<BR>from now on, without his office's consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The letter copied to both Uganda Motor Club (UMC) and<BR>Motorsport Africa Club (MOSAC) has caused a stir among the<BR>motorsport fraternity who received the Byabashaija new move with<BR>shock and amusement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Byabasaija and his AA used to show up at the beginning of<BR>rallies to collect money, until the motor clubs laughed him out of<BR>town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tegalya Nsubuga told the motorsport fraternity last Wednesday<BR>that MOSAC was only dreaming of the Africa Rally Championship in<BR>February, because UAA which claims to be affiliated to FISA in<BR>Paris, is the only body with the authority over such an event in<BR>Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting also learnt for the first time that the UAA<BR>executive include Augustine Byabashaija, Bagonza, Arthur Blick and<BR>Sam Ssali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The motorsport fraternity demanded that the officials of UAA<BR>produce documents to prove their legitimacy and they should be<BR>invited to brief the drivers and crews of their role in the<BR>motorsport before they can be taken seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UAA idea was prominent mid this year when the news of<BR>MOSAC's plan to hold an African Championship came up. MOSAC and<BR>UMC set up a team to form a proper UAA, but the plan went up in<BR>smoke in the notoriously cloak and dagger world of Uganda<BR>motorsport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Wednesday, Justin Beyendeza (JB), speaking on behalf of<BR>MOSAC, said the African Rally championship to be held in February<BR>next year was in the bag. He said it had already been sanctioned<BR>by FIA, and it will be held by under the auspices of Burundi<BR>Automobile Association in conjunction with MOSAC. MOSAC has put<BR>its money where its mouth is--it has paid Shs 4 million for FIA<BR>for the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That has been the basic conflict in motorsport; the struggle<BR>between those who want to put money in, and those who want to take<BR>it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, mid next month, six Ugandan drivers preparing<BR>themselves for the Africa Rally championship, will take part in<BR>the Kenya Caltex Equatorial Rally.<BR>The Uganda team to be lead by &quot;Capo&quot; Karim Hirji and Frank Nekusa<BR>(Celica GT4) include: Gerald Kiddu and Paul Hendrickx (Golf GTI),<BR>Chipper Adams and Justin Beyendeza (Corolla DX), Yusuf Karmali and<BR>Haruna Nsubuga (Subaru Legacy) and Dipu Ruparellia and Isaac<BR>Rwakiseeta (Nissan 240 RS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In yet another development, the newly formed United Motorsport<BR>Club(UMOSPOC) will hold an auto-cross and a social evening on<BR>Sunday November 12, at Maya. The meet will include a number of<BR>events ranging from short races to special events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those without rally cars can come with their ordinary cars and<BR>still have fun. The occasion will be crowned by &quot;muchomo&quot;<BR>roasting, plenty of drinks at give away price. The Maya meet will<BR>be the curtain-raiser to the final round of the Nakisunga Sprints<BR>organised by MOSAC. The sprint is to be held towards the end of<BR>November.<BR>-0Africa-At-Large</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA - In a speech seen as a criticism of President Yoweri<BR>Museveni's politics, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said<BR>Africans cannot wait for a middle class to grow first before they<BR>get democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zenawi was speaking at a dinner in Washington DC hosted for<BR>seven African Presidents to which Museveni was not invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the Ethiopian Executive Premier did not directly refer<BR>to Museveni, he challenged two arguments which have been President<BR>Museveni's trademark in his defence of the suspension of multiethnicity.<BR>party politics -- the lack of a middle class and the problem of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The argument that multi-party democracy fuels ethnic strife<BR>cannot be sustained,&quot; Zenawi said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is rather the unfair treatment of ethnic groups, forceful<BR>attempts at eliminating ethnic identities, and the use of<BR>political power as a means of personal enrichment, or the<BR>perception thereof, which, more often than not, lead to ethnic<BR>strife and conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Zenawi said that extreme poverty of the type in Africa<BR>is not conducive to democracy, he did not agree that Africans must<BR>first wait for the growth of a strong middle class, as Museveni<BR>likes to argue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;...it does not follow that we either can, or ought to,<BR>postpone democratization until such a time as we become rich,&quot; he<BR>said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zenawi, also Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity<BR>(OAU), was the keynote speaker at the Reverend John T. Walker<BR>Dinner organised by Africare on October 19 in honour of Reverend<BR>Leon H. Sullivan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africare is a non-profit organisation engaged in developmental<BR>programmes in rural Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dinner recognised the contributions of seven African heads<BR>of state toward political and economic development in sub-Saharan<BR>Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other six leaders who were invited to the dinner were<BR>Ketumile Masire of Botswana, Ange-Felix Patasse of Central African<BR>Republic, Joao Bernardo Vieira of Guinea-Bissau, Bakili Muluzi of<BR>Malawi, Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda and King Mswati III of<BR>Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The seven leaders also earlier met with US President Bill<BR>Clinton at a reception held before the dinner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zenawi's words on democracy came only 10 days after he was in<BR>Uganda for the country's 33rd independence anniversary<BR>celebrations in Fort Portal where he was awarded Order of the<BR>Pearl of Africa Class I.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The award, which Museveni too received, is the highest among<BR>the series of awards the NRM has just introduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni that time described Zenawi as one of the illustrious<BR>sons of Africa and commended him for having returned power to the<BR>people before getting elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zenawi's Ethiopian People's Liberation Front captured power in<BR>1991 from dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam and initiated a<BR>democratisation process that saw the country get a new<BR>constitution this year, under which he was elected Executive Prime<BR>Minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But at the US dinner, although Zenawi did not directly refer to<BR>Museveni his words were, to say the least, unflattering to the<BR>Ugandan President who is now perhaps the continent's biggest<BR>proponent of the suspension of political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ethiopian premier said that democracy (read multi-party) is<BR>not a flawless form of government and that its weaknesses are<BR>plenty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But since the alternatives are even worse,&quot; he said, &quot;the<BR>challenge is to get democracy to work at its best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zenawi challenged those who argue that ethnicity is the major<BR>culprit making development of democracy in Africa difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is ...little doubt that managing ethnicity within a<BR>democratic context is one of the major challengers of<BR>democratization have been aborted in Africa due to ethnic tension<BR>and strife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But the intimation that ethnicity per se abhors democracy and<BR>vice versa is not borne out by empirical and historical facts,&quot;<BR>Zenawi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ethiopian Premier admitted that broad-based or governments<BR>of national unity may help overcome the perceived problem posed by<BR>ethnicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(But) the attempt to make it a permanent fixture (like NRM has<BR>done) would naturally result in paralysis and gridlock and would<BR>defeat the purpose of providing alternatives to the electorate,&quot;<BR>he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Zenawi agreed that the extreme poverty in Africa is<BR>not conducive to democracy, he said it should not be used as a<BR>pretext to postpone democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I for one know of no conclusive study which proves that<BR>dictatorships do better than democracies in terms of economic<BR>development,&quot; Zenawi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the dictatorships in Africa are not of the East-Asian<BR>type which have tended to focus on wealth creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Ours have been of the predatory type with the proclivity to<BR>consuming the already available wealth to the point of killing the<BR>hen that lays the golden egg,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zenawi said that democracy can be learned only by engaging in<BR>it and by practicing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;So we cannot postpone democracy so that we can think about it<BR>before we practise it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zenawi also criticised international donors for what he called<BR>their lack of patience and tendency to overlook how the task of<BR>democratization in Africa is a long-term and complicated task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The success of democratization in our continent requires<BR>tender nurturing of the shoots of democracy for years,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When friends tell us that they support democracy and at the<BR>same time do not do much to relieve us of our enormous debt<BR>burden, and instead cut back support to our development efforts,<BR>we cannot but wonder if their money is where their mouths is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still the Ethiopian Premier echoed his conviction that<BR>democratization in Africa has a bright future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But we have to proceed with confidence because the shoots of<BR>democracy are sprouting everywhere in Africa,&quot; he said, &quot;and with<BR>your support, I am hopeful, over the coming years, they will grow<BR>into mighty and healthy trees.&quot;<BR>-0Uganda</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Each presidential candidate in Uganda's forthcoming<BR>elections will get Shs 10 million from the state if the Interim<BR>Presidential Elections Bill, 1995, is passed into law in its<BR>present form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to section 8 of the bill, which is still<BR>&quot;confidential,&quot; the Secretary of the Treasury, shall, within two<BR>weeks after the nomination day, &quot;pay to every candidate a sum of<BR>ten million shillings which the candidate shall devote solely for<BR>the purposes of conducting his or her campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, sub-section (2) proposes that every candidate shall be<BR>at liberty to raise additional funds for his or her campaign<BR>through lawful means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The money paid to the candidates by the state shall have to by<BR>accounted for by every candidate within 30 days after polling day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far the incumbent President, Yoweri Museveni, DP Chief Paul<BR>Kawanga Ssemogerere and UPC stalwart Adonia Tiberondwa are the<BR>ones who appear serious contenders for the presidency. They have<BR>all declared their intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Presidential Elections Bill comes at a time when<BR>international donors and opposition politicians are pressing for a<BR>level playing field in the run-up to the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DP Chief Paul Ssemogerere hinted at a press conference last<BR>week that he and his party might boycott the elections if the<BR>ground is not levelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I want these elections to take place, but if the law does not<BR>answer (our demands), we shall do the obvious,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As if to take care of such demands, section 9 of the Interim<BR>Presidential Elections Law proposes that &quot;Except as authorised<BR>under this Act, no candidate shall use government resources for<BR>the purpose of campaigning for election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sub-section (2), however proposes that &quot;notwithstanding<BR>subsection (1), a candidate who for the time being is holding the<BR>office of President, may continue to use during the campaign and<BR>shall use only those government facilities which are ordinarily<BR>attached and utilised by the holder of that office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The section also proposes that it shall be valid ground for<BR>petition if a candidate utilised government resources not<BR>authorised under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Section 7 proposes that &quot;every presidential candidate shall be<BR>at liberty to hold individual campaign rallies in any part of<BR>Uganda in accordance with any existing law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sub-section(2), however, proposes that the Electoral Commission<BR>shall prepare and conduct a programme called the Presidential<BR>Candidates Meetings Programmes. All presidential candidates shall<BR>speak at one such meeting in every district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sub-section (4) proposes that &quot;no candidate in an election<BR>shall be denied reasonable access, and use of state-owned media<BR>communication&quot; while sub-section (5) says &quot;all candidates shall be<BR>given free and reasonable time and space in the State-owned media<BR>to present their programmes to the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To qualify as a presidential candidate, Section 5 (2) says,<BR>candidates must submit to the Electoral Commission, a day before<BR>nomination day, nomination papers which must be supported by one<BR>hundred voters in each of at least two thirds (26) of all the<BR>districts in Uganda. In other words each candidate would require<BR>at least 2,600 signatures of registered voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sub-section (3) proposes that the nomination paper must be<BR>accompanied by, among others, a form for declaration of assets and<BR>liabilities; and a deposit of Shs. 2 million.<BR> Candidates who poll more than 25 percent of the total votes cast<BR>in the election will be entitled to a refund of their Shs. 2<BR>million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to our information, the idea of candidates' declaring<BR>their assets and liabilities is the brain-child of President<BR>Museveni who is said to have studied the bill closely before he<BR>left for the United States to attend the 50th anniversary of the<BR>United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposed law provides that a person who knowingly makes a<BR>false declaration of assets and liabilities, commits an offence<BR>and shall be liable on conviction to a term of imprisonment not<BR>exceeding two years without an option of a fine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to other provisions in the proposed law a<BR>presidential candidate must be a citizen of Uganda by birth, and<BR>must be not less than 35 and not more than 75 years of age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He or she, another provision proposes, must have completed a<BR>minimum formal education of Advanced level standard or its<BR>equivalent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The elections shall be by universal adult suffrage through a<BR>secret ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Section 19 of the bill says that a candidate will need more<BR>than fifty percent of the valid votes cast to be declared<BR>president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where there are more than two candidates, and no candidate<BR>obtains the required 50 percent, a second election shall be held<BR>within thirty days after the declaration of the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only the two candidates who obtained the highest number of<BR>votes shall contest in such an election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bill is expected to be tabled before Parliament next month.<BR>The Interim Parliamentary Elections Bill, 1995 is also yet to be<BR>tabled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - just two months away from the Africa Cup of Nations<BR>finals were in shambles yesterday as they trounced Jamaica 4-2 at<BR>Independence Stadium in Lusaka during an international friendly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The victory was not enough for the usually hostile Independence<BR>Stadium crowd who refused to be fooled by the 4-2 win, and instead<BR>chose to shout at coach Roald Poulsen &quot;You are not building you<BR>are killing Zambia.&quot; It was a clear message for the Dane that the<BR>seven months the national squad has been under him, Zambia had not<BR>taken a single step from that grim performance of a 9-0 bashing<BR>against Belgium last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The defence, once strongest unit of the team, was leaking with<BR>goals while generally the team was still short of pace, a thing<BR>that Poulsen admitted because there was no craft and creativity<BR>into the Zambian side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They badly needed inspirational and Poulsen was looking to<BR>Kenneth &quot;Bubble&quot; Malitoli and added &quot;I will need his services<BR>badly.&quot; But Poulsen wondered what the soccer fans were up to<BR>especially that the side was now much better than before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't know what people want, instead of giving support to<BR>the team, they just started cheering Jamaica, that nearly affected<BR>the players but I was happy that they remained calm. &quot;I am still<BR>working on the team before we finally leave for South Africa, it<BR>will be a better team,&quot; he promised. Goals by Andrew Tembo, who<BR>struck twice, substitute Bilton Musonda and Dennis Lota however<BR>managed to save Zambia from further humiliation at Independence<BR>Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But then Loglten Boyd did all the damage in the Zambian side<BR>for the enterprising Jamaicans to earn some cheers from the crowd.<BR>Boyd led the West Indies attack and pushed his side 2-1 at one<BR>point. The Zambian bench disputed the two goals sent in by Boyd<BR>claiming they scored from an offside angle. So disorganised was<BR>the Zambian side that Aggrey Chiyangi failed to convert a penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jamaica played without their centre forward Gregory Stewart who<BR>was sent off for punching Malitoli at the edge of their goal<BR>mouth. On Friday Zambia won 1-0 against the Jamaican side at<BR>Arthur Davies Stadium in Kitwe.<BR>-0Zambia</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whereas these concerns may be genuine, or indeed the<BR>allegations of intelligence connections and election claims proved<BR>to be true, the real problem doesn't seem to begin and end with<BR>Nikuv's integrity or lack of it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems seem to lurk in the<BR>confidence many critical citizens have in President Frederick<BR>Chiluba and other key leaders of the ruling MMD.Those who have<BR>participated in the parliamentary by-elections have complained<BR>about the MMD's abuse of the electoral process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post of Zambia (Lusaka) (19951107)<BR>November 7, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The decision by the government to ignore opposition to<BR>its awarding of a contract to an Israeli firm, Nikuv, to update<BR>the voters register raises many suspicions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nikuv has been accused by many of being connected to the<BR>notorious Israeli intelligence organisation, Mossad. And neither<BR>Nikuv nor the Zambian government has denied this charge. All we<BR>have heard, so far, is the government defending Nikuv's ability<BR>and capacity to complete the job in time for the elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nikuv has not denied accusations of facilitating election<BR>rigging in countries where they have set up electoral systems. The<BR>accusations stretch from Africa to South America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clearly Nikuv doesn't seem to have a good reputation, in the<BR>popular sense, in this business, but it certainly must have<BR>something to offer to those who hire or contract them. And the<BR>benefits to a government that contracts Nikuv is what needs to be<BR>urgently established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It seems, there are only three possible benefits for hiring<BR>Nikuv. The first two have been loudly, but not necessarily well<BR>argued. The firm's ability and capacity, as a benefit, has been<BR>defended by the government as the reason for contracting the firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The firm's ability and capacity to help 'contractors' rig<BR>elections has been voiced by many interested persons and<BR>organisations, but with little, if any, substantiation. But what<BR>is undoubtable is the dark cloud that now, or will, hang on the<BR>integrity of our electoral process. And given the persistent<BR>rumours of election rigging by the ruling MMD in by-elections that<BR>have been held countrywide and the general lack of citizen<BR>confidence in the electoral processes in Africa, we find it unwise<BR>for the government to contract Nikuv. W e should always remember<BR>that it is very vital and critical to the democratic process to<BR>create and foster an environment under which those defeated in an<BR>election accept losing and look forward to the next ones. But if<BR>the losers feel they have been cheated or robbed of victory we<BR>have seen what has happened in other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not a matter in which one should demonstrate his<BR>mandate gained in a previous election to make decisions and hire<BR>whoever he or she wants. This is also not the kind of issue in<BR>which one shows off one's political muscle. It is an issue in<BR>which all citizens, whether in the political majority or minority,<BR>will simultaneously be losers or winners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If MMD's motivation, in its deal with Nikuv, is rigging the<BR>danger signs are clearly written on the wall.<BR>-0Zambia</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The Post of Zambia (Lusaka)<BR>November 7, 1995 (19951107)<BR>by Bandawe Banda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The recent spate of riots and near-riots Zambia has<BR>witnessed clearly demonstrates that democracy cannot survive where<BR>there is a huge gap between political and economic rights.<BR>Economic decline and its attendance poverty experienced by the<BR>vast majority of the people has great potential for cleavage and<BR>conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, youths went on rampage in Lusaka precipitated by<BR>rumours that former president Kenneth Kaunda would face<BR>deportation. Last week Livingstone was on fire because of ritual<BR>murders allegedly committed by the locals on behalf of some<BR>Asians. At the University of Zambia students became riotous on<BR>account of government delays to give them their allowances.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These spontaneous manifestations of violence are as a result of<BR>discontent in this country. The stiff implementations of the IMF<BR>and World Bank conditionalities by the MMD government has led to<BR>the now commonplace retrenchments thereby enlarging the reserve<BR>army of labour while job creation is at standstill. The<BR>agricultural and manufacturing sectors are on a sharp decline as<BR>the government puts emphasis on opening up the economy to foreign<BR>investors (a euphemism for any trader who happens to be non-black<BR>and non-Zambian).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the process, prices of basic necessities have shot up making<BR>them inaccessibble to the majority, crime has reached its highest<BR>levels, making a real mockery of Zambia's security wings.<BR>Corruption in high places is so common that the Anti-corruption<BR>Commissionm has become irrelevant. The list is clearly endless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A sad situation such as this is potentially volatile and<BR>violence prone. Hence, such incidents in normal circumstances do<BR>not bring excitement like the snatching of a women's handbag on<BR>October 18, which almost paralysed Lusaka by rampaging youths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government must address the real causes of these problems<BR>and not the symptoms. But does it have the stamina for that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good governance and political accountability cannot exist under<BR>conditions such as the ones prevailing in Zambia today. Of course,<BR>Zambia has not reached the stage of overt violence though there is<BR>an undeniably conflict situation in the country. Yet, absence of<BR>war does not mean that there is justice for all. There is a danger<BR>that if the situation coninues to deteriorate, there would be<BR>bloodletting in this country which many uncritical minds would<BR>have thought to be peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda was convinced that he had Zambia firmly under his<BR>control until the food riots of 1990. What followed was a fast<BR>flow of human events culminating in the Mwamba Luchembe coup<BR>attempt. The man certainly never knew what hit him. The people of<BR>this country whom he said should never be taken for granted poured<BR>onto the streets celebrating what they thought was his political<BR>demise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If it had taken place ten years previously, the coup attempt<BR>would have been considered a big joke because Kaunda and his UNIP<BR>were power and fire. As the economic situation got worse along<BR>with living standards plummeted and politically everyone had to<BR>toe the UNIP line. As with Kaunda, the Fredrick Chiluba regime is<BR>convinced that it holds sway over the people of Zambia and that<BR>the riots are simply sporadic and insignificant. No serious effort<BR>is made for a more concrete and profound understanding of the<BR>whole issue. It is vital to handle potentially violent situations<BR>with great care and not emotionally like calling for the expulsion<BR>of Asians suspected of being involved in the Livingstone ritual<BR>murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the retrenchments, poverty and hunger, black Zambians out<BR>of desperation found themselves vulnerable to carrying out these<BR>heinous crimes. That of course does not justify the acts of the<BR>criminals who should be brought to book urgently. No sane mind<BR>could condone the Livingstone murders. What is required is a sober<BR>analysis of the whole matter for the law to take its course and to<BR>find measures that would ensure that there is no repeat both in<BR>the tourist capital and elsewhere. All in all, the MMD government<BR>must brace itself for riots of all sorts as the simmering<BR>political and economic disillusionment rises.<BR>-0Zambia</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The store, situated on the corner of Commissioner and Kruis, is<BR>owned by George Charalambous, a franchisee of 10 Chicken Licken<BR>stores, part of the fast food chain owned by George Sombonos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charalambous is also owner of Daxprop which, together with<BR>Joburgers, owned by Sombonos, applied to have McDonald's trademark<BR>expunged from the registrar on the basis of non-use.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two Georges won the court case against US McDonald's in<BR>October this year, but the case has since gone on appeal and will<BR>be heard in the Appellate Court next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charalambous is also the owner of MacDonalds in Durban which<BR>has been operating since 1978, a key factor in the case against US<BR>McDonald's, which had not established good will in the country as<BR>it had never operated here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the opening, Charalambous' attorney Sean Ryan said<BR>that this second MacDonald's store was just part of his client's<BR>&quot;orderly&quot; expansion plans. &quot;He is proceeding with his own plans<BR>to set up a chain of MacDonald's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that even if US McDonald's wins the appeal case,it is<BR>unlikely that Charalambous could be sued for infringement as he is<BR>entitled to concurrent registration of the trademark because his<BR>shop had been trading under the trademarks and was entitled to<BR>protection in terms of the 1993 Act which allows use of a well<BR>known trademark before September 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ryan said the 80m2 store would have opened earlier but was<BR>delayed pending the outcome of the court case. He says the site is<BR>ideal to attract both black and white sectors of the<BR>population,&quot;unlike US McDonald's which is setting up in a white<BR>suburb with a drive-through restaurant which caters for white<BR>people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ryan said McDonald's has intimated that court action will be<BR>taken against Charalambous as a result of the store opening but<BR>says he is not sure what the action will entail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He defended Charalambous against accusations that the opening<BR>was deliberately flying in the face of the US McDonald's planned<BR>launch later this week. &quot;We opened first in Durban and this shop<BR>has opened first in Johannesburg, so who is following whom?&quot;<BR>-0Zambia</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Human rights organisations are scrutinising the<BR>background and track records of nominees for the Truth and<BR>Reconciliation Commission, and will be making submissions to the<BR>special panel which starts interviewing 46 candidates on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indications are that questions will be raised about some of the<BR>nominees in terms of the criteria set down to guide their<BR>selection: that they should not have a high political profile and<BR>should show a demonstrable commitment to human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretoria advocate Professor Pieter Oosthuizen, nominated by the<BR>League of Former Police Officials, was a member of the team which<BR>prosecuted Communist Party leader Braam Fischer, who was sentenced<BR>to life imprisonment. He also prosecuted in the mammoth 1967 trial<BR>of Swapo members, including its founder, Andimba Herman Toivo ja<BR>Toivo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial in Pretoria attracted international attention as it<BR>was the first time the Terrorism Act of 1967, which was made<BR>retroactive to 1962 and put the burden of proof on the accused,<BR>was used. The United Nations declared the trial illegal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Freedom Front nominee advocate Chris de Jager enjoyed a high<BR>political profile as an MP and the founder of the Afrikaner<BR>Volksunie (AVU). He was the chief negotiator for the Conservative<BR>Party and the AVU during 1993 and is a part-time member of the<BR>Vokstaat Council. He has already been selected to sit on the Human<BR>Rights Commission and may have to withdraw from it if selected for<BR>the truth commission as it seems unlikely he would be able to<BR>serve on both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Questions may also be raised about two other nominees,<BR>Mitchell's Plain Uniting Reformed Church (formerly the Dutch<BR>Reformed Mission Church) clergyman Ds Jan Mettler and Free State<BR>University law faculty dean Professor Dan Morkel. Both have served<BR>on the Publications Appeal Board; for some, this raises concerns<BR>about their commitment to transparency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another nominee, Professor Jabulani Maphalala, describes his<BR>nationality in his CV as &quot;native African South African of Zulu<BR>extraction&quot;. An associate professor of history at the University<BR>of Zululand, which nominated him, he has written about the role of<BR>Inkatha as &quot;a national and cultural liberation movement&quot; and spent<BR>time in Germany on a scholarship from the Konrad Adenauer<BR>Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University of the Western Cape academic Professor Adam Small's<BR>acceptance of his nomination by the Democratic Party has raised<BR>eyebrows. Writing in a regular weekly newspaper column, Professor<BR>Small has questioned the need for the &quot;melodrama&quot; of a truth<BR>commission and its cost, suggesting matters should be left to the<BR>law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Azapo has objected to the nomination of theologian Dr Frank<BR>Chikane on grounds that when he was general-secretary of the South<BR>African Council of Churches his involvement with the United<BR>Democratic Front impeded Azapo's access to foreign funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 46 nominees, selected from a preliminary list of 160 names<BR>drawn from a total of 299 candidates, will be interviewed during<BR>the course of next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conducting the interviews will be a panel chaired by<BR>presidential legal adviser Professor Nicholas Haysom. It includes<BR>the South African Council of Churches' Brigalia Bam, Senator<BR>Rossier de Ville, ANC MP Baleka Kgositsile, Jody Kollapen,<BR>Jayendra Naidoo, IFP MP Professor Harriet Ngubane, Senator Ray<BR>Radue and Bishop Peter Storey.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The battle is on for the most powerful newspaper<BR>position in the country: editor of the country's biggest paper,<BR>The Sunday Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The choice of who will replace Ken Owen, who will retire next<BR>year, is the subject of unbridled speculation, dinner party gossip<BR>and quiet competition among the circle of candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The result, when finally decided, is likely to surprise<BR>everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Succession in newspapers is never clear cut. Witness the<BR>surprise appointment by the then South African Associated<BR>Newspapers board of the selfsame Ken Owen as editor of Business<BR>Day in 1985 _ and his equally surprising removal after only a few<BR>days, followed by an equally surprising reappointment about a year<BR>later.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Owen, asked if he knew who his successor might be, replied<BR>laconically and finally: &quot;Why not ask the board?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The board will have to focus its collective mind soon on the<BR>appointment of a successor to Owen. He is due to leave in the<BR>middle of next year, but an accumulation of leave will probably<BR>mean he will depart earlier. Times Media Limited managing director<BR>Roy Paulson could not be contacted for comment before going to<BR>press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clearly, complicating the decision will be two factors:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The need to make good a worrying decline in circulation to a<BR>rumoured 465,000 from the long-established level of half a million<BR>copies;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * A concerted campaign by members of the present government<BR>against white &quot;liberal&quot; editors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Owen, observers believe, has created a new credibility for the<BR>Sunday Times, and jacked up its political journalism, but the<BR>paper has not escaped the post-election slump in circulation faced<BR>by many English-language newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Owen's own analysis suggests that whites, the Sunday Times'<BR>traditional readership base, feel disempowered and uninterested.<BR>He has contrasted the decline in English newspaper circulations<BR>with the comparative success of Afrikaans newspapers, indicating<BR>that their anti-government stance strikes a chord with their<BR>readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conundrum faced by the present owners is whether to return<BR>to the frothy, popular formula on which the Sunday Times' mass<BR>market appeal was built, to keep the paper on the present course<BR>set by Owen, or to take a radically different tack and go for the<BR>black market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first would mean concentrating on gut-feel issues like<BR>crime, abortion, gossip, reviving the sex scandal-mongering back<BR>page and undressing back page girls whom Owen has covered up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here the name of Rick Wilson, at present editor of the Eastern<BR>Province Herald, is listed as a strong candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wilson is one of the Sunday Times old guard who flourished<BR>under former editor, the late Tertius Myburgh, the raconteur who<BR>ran a supposedly liberal paper which greeted the Botswana massacre<BR>by South African Defence Force soldiers of sleeping African<BR>National Congress supporters with the headline, &quot;The guns of<BR>Gaborone&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the paper is to continue on the strongly political, liberal,<BR>slightly more upmarket path it has followed so far, an internal<BR>appointment is possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Internally, several candidates have been mentioned: Business<BR>Day editor Jim Jones and electronic media general manager Neil<BR>Jacobsohn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ex-managing director of TML, temporarily in Australia, Steve<BR>Mulholland is due back in South Africa next year. He too has been<BR>mentioned. Mulholland has an affinity for the Times, having served<BR>there as a reporter, and having founded the Business Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the paper itself, two candidates are mentioned: deputy<BR>editor Brian Pottinger, a survivor of the Myburgh era, and Owen's<BR>protege, Mike Robertson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No one else in &quot;Stab Alley&quot;, as the senior editorial offices<BR>are known, is suggested as a candidate. Deputies are seldom made<BR>editors, and Robertson is reckoned by insiders to be inexperienced<BR>-- and not black enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The board must consider government pressure to replace mainly<BR>white editors of the mainstream press with blacks, either under<BR>the erroneous impression that black editors will be less critical,<BR>or to browbeat those white editors into toning down their<BR>criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Thabo Mbeki inspired campaign has had Black Editors' Forum<BR>head and Black Enterprise editor Thami Mazwai as its stalking<BR>horse. Could he be a candidate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers reckon Mazwai's anti-white rhetoric would alienate<BR>too many staffers, let alone readers. And could the board, looking<BR>to the future black mass market, take the chance of turning its<BR>back on the white market, and appoint an editor who will turn the<BR>Sunday Times into a &quot;black&quot; newspaper?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A compromise would be a black editor who could run the Sunday<BR>Times along popular lines and take a strongly independent stance<BR>which would not offend white readers, while drawing in new black<BR>readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This suggests one well-known candidate: Jon Qwelane, editor of<BR>Tribute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Qwelane is maverick enough not to be identified too closely<BR>with any political party and to tackle tough issues in the<BR>combative, newsy style expected on a popular newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He surprised blacks and whites and opened himself up to<BR>accusations of subverting black empowerment by exposing executive<BR>shenanigans at National Sorghum Breweries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One candidate whose name has come up is another successful<BR>Sunday paper editor, City Press' Khulu Sibiya. Sibiya was a<BR>surprise choice as editor, but has managed to lift his paper's<BR>circulation significantly. However, his credibility took a knock<BR>when he resigned as convener of the Conference of Editors, citing<BR>it was proving impossible to unite editors across racial lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whoever the mainly white, conservative board appoints will have<BR>to remember that ultimate control of TML, through Omni Media and,<BR>in turn, Johnnic, will soon be in black hands.<BR>-0South Africa</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The amalgamation of former sworn enemies --<BR>opposing sides of the apartheid divide -- into the police unit<BR>protecting President Nelson Mandela and other VIPs may have<BR>compromised the effectiveness of the unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela, in a gesture of reconciliation, uses a team from the<BR>National Protection Service (NPS) composed about half of members<BR>formerly with the African National Congress' Department of<BR>Intelligence and Security (DIS) and half of the old South African<BR>Police Special Guard Unit (SGU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela trusts them, and his gesture is thought to have<BR>increased their loyalty, but not everyone shares this confidence.<BR>Should the loyalty of, for example, a policeman assigned to<BR>Mandela's protection be doubted, former ANC operatives will ensure<BR>Mandela is &quot;covered&quot; by one of their own.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy President FW de Klerk so distrusts his old rivals that<BR>he still uses no bodyguards from either an ANC or a PAC<BR>background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the Mail &amp; Guardian is aware of instances where operatives<BR>of questionable character have made it into the NPS. There are<BR>strong allegations that an off-duty NPS member &quot;executed&quot; a<BR>criminal in Soweto in September as part of an unorthodox antilater joined DIS, is alleged to direct a &quot;vigilante gang&quot; in a<BR>crime drive, while another member, a former Inkatha &quot;warlord&quot; who<BR>Durban township. Some NPS members from the SGU are known to have a<BR>record of involvement in dubious activities of the old security<BR>police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> News images flashed across the world last weekend showing how<BR>security men shoved Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin into his<BR>limousine, shielding him from further attack, after right-wing<BR>student Yigal Amir shot him twice at close range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the action of the security men, acknowledged to be among<BR>the best trained in the world, came too late; the premier, a hawk<BR>turned dove in Israel's peace process, died in hospital soon<BR>after. The assassination sent shock waves around the globe, not<BR>least among the security agencies responsible for the safety of<BR>the world's leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In South Africa, two factors increased apprehension about the<BR>chances of a &quot;copycat&quot; attempt. First, as police commissioner<BR>George Fivaz pointed out when he announced this week he had put<BR>South Africa's VIP protectors on full alert, there are &quot;distinct<BR>parallels&quot; between the political processes in Israel and South<BR>Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly -- a factor which aggravates the &quot;parallels&quot; -- there<BR>are fears of a right-wing backlash, likely to involve security<BR>force personnel, after last week's arrest on third force<BR>allegations of ex-defence minister Magnus Malan and top military<BR>officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A secret police document leaked to the media relays Fivaz's<BR>concern over the possibility of a &quot;mobilisation&quot; by former and<BR>serving security force members against the arrests and instructs<BR>the police Crime Intelligence Service to evaluate the threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where the loyalty of members of the police and the military is<BR>in question, it becomes all the more important that the loyalty of<BR>those who protect VIPs is undivided. The spectre rises of the<BR>assassination of Indian premier Indira Gandhi, killed by her own<BR>bodyguards, Sikhs who thought her policies contrary to the<BR>interests of India's Sikh community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It appears the NPS, the unit responsible for the safety of<BR>Mandela and his deputies, cabinet ministers and their deputies,<BR>some judges, and other public figures, is subject to at least some<BR>of the same factors that have strained the integration process<BR>elsewhere in the police and military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NPS is a product mainly of the amalgamation of the old<BR>South African Police SGU (which had close links with the apartheid<BR>security police), members of the ANC's DIS, and members of the<BR>security arm of the Pan Africanist Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, in the flush of reconciliation between former enemies,<BR>lower standards of security screening may have been applied lest<BR>anyone feels slighted by rebuffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tightrope of amalgamation is reflected in the command<BR>structure. There are &quot;joint commanders&quot; at different levels, and<BR>the NPS, nationally, is commanded by two men: Brigadier Gary<BR>Kruser, formerly with DIS, is in charge of operations, while<BR>Brigadier Riaan Engelbrecht, formerly Special Guard Unit, is in<BR>charge of planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kruser acknowledged there &quot;have been problems, and will<BR>continue to be problems&quot;, but said they had been fewer than<BR>expected. He said the first batch of NPS members had been sent<BR>this week on a new VIP protection course, designed in consultation<BR>with international experts, to &quot;cement&quot; the skills obtained in<BR>widely divergent training backgrounds. All members will eventually<BR>have to do the course. Standard security screening procedures had<BR>been used to select NPS members, and some DIS operatives had not<BR>made the grade because of previous criminal activities, Kruser<BR>said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The amalgamation process -- which is not yet complete --<BR>remains fraught with difficulties. The VIP protection unit of the<BR>old KwaZulu Police, which is supposed to integrate with the NPS as<BR>the KwaZulu Police integrates with the South African Police<BR>Service, has so far remained separate. Its commander, Major<BR>Leonard Langeni, was named before last year's elections in a<BR>Transitional Executive Council report on KwaZulu-Natal hitMalan trial.<BR>squads, and has now been added to the list of witnesses in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The KwaZulu Police VIP protection unit includes members of the<BR>&quot;Caprivi 200&quot;, the group of Zulu warriors trained by the South<BR>African Defence Force on the Angolan border in 1986, and which is<BR>implicated in hit-squad activities in the case against Malan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In that unit, the distinction between assassin and guard<BR>against assassination appears blurred. When the time comes to<BR>integrate these men into the NPS, will secure screening procedures<BR>override the need for &quot;reconciliation&quot;, and will South Africa's<BR>leaders be safe?<BR>-0South Africa</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>November 6, 1995 (19951106)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nakuru - Outspoken Kenyan Catholic bishop Ndingi Mwana a'Nzeki<BR>has told Kenyan politicians he is not interested in vying for the<BR>country's presidency in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting to recent press reports to the effect that some<BR>opposition parties had already floated his name as a possible<BR>presidential candidate, come the 1997 general elections and that<BR>two senior ministers in President Moi's government have already<BR>approached him for his stand over the issue, the Nakuru Catholic<BR>Diocese bishop said he was &quot;not up for grabs&quot; and &quot;not for<BR>politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the press conference, October 26 at his diocesan office<BR>here, some 140 kilometres northwest of the capital, Nairobi, Mwana<BR>a'Nzeki named two Kenya African National Union (K ANU) government<BR>ministers who had approached the clergy seeking his stand on the<BR>claims by the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But on both occasions I told them &quot;NO&quot; never. My priority is<BR>and has always been to be a simple parrish priest and serve the<BR>Lord's flock,&quot; he disclosed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Ndingi says he was first approached by a mutual friend<BR>sent by one of the Cabinet Ministers during the visit by Pope John<BR>Paul II to Kenya in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The friend who is also a priest told me that the minister was<BR>anxious to know if the opposition had approached me to be their<BR>joint candidate in the 1997 General Elections to oppose President<BR>Moi,&quot; said the bishop. The second time was on October 7 when<BR>President Moi officiated at a fundraising ceremony at Mary Mount<BR>Secondary School in Molo within Ndingi's Nakuru Catholic diocese.<BR>&quot;This time, I gave him the same answer,&quot; noted Ndingi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the fiery Catholic bishop did not dwell much on claims by<BR>the opposition that they have already floated his name as a<BR>possible presidential candidate for the 1997 general elections. He<BR>would only say... &quot;I agree with them (as reported in sections of<BR>the press) that I am a principled clergyman, who would not abandon<BR>priesthood for political office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a lead story, a local influential weekly, Weekly Review, of<BR>October 20, carried a report to the effect that the opposition had<BR>identified and agreed on Bishop Ndingi's candidacy due to his<BR>relentless pursuit of and firm stand on human rights issues and<BR>his acceptability by a cross-section of Kenyans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Names of possible clergymen are already being floated, but the<BR>one that keeps on coming up is that of Bishop Ndingi Mwana a'Nzeki<BR>of the Catholic diocese of Nakuru,&quot; said the Weekly Review report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This debate seems to have been sparked by claims by outspoken<BR>opposition Member of Parliament Raila Odinga of the Forum for the<BR>Restoration of Democracy - Kenya (FORD-K) to the effect that the<BR>opposition had agreed to field a clergyman to oppose President Moi<BR>in the coming elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On August 6 1995, Raila, a son of the late nationalist Jaramogi<BR>Oginga Odinga, was reported saying that following talks with<BR>another opposition member, the Democratic Party (DP), both sides<BR>had agreed the opposition should field a single candidate to stand<BR>against President Moi in the 1997 general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Representatives of the two parties now want to identify a<BR>suitable candidate and persuade their colleagues and other<BR>opposition parties that this is the only way they can challenge<BR>the all-powerful KANU government and president Moi,&quot; Raila was<BR>reported saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting to the suggestion to field Bishop Ndingi's name for a<BR>presidential candidate, a Catholic priest, who chose anonymity<BR>told APS; &quot;There is nothing wrong in floating his (Ndingi's) name,<BR>but they (politicians) have either assumed or are assuming alot.<BR>He is too principled to be swayed too easily on either political<BR>side. I hope they have got the message right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Ndingi, has often locked horns with the government of<BR>the day over numerous issues, the most recent being the 1991-93<BR>land clashes, which resulted in deaths of innocent civilians and<BR>displaced thousands others mostly within the Rift Valley and<BR>Western provinces.<BR>-0South Africa</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monrovia - The Inter-faith Mediation Committee has accused<BR>some members of Liberia's ruling six-man State Council of engaging<BR>in a media war while their respective security apparatus assault,<BR>harass and intimidate civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee which comprises Christian and Muslim religious<BR>leaders was established in 1990 with the objective of mediating<BR>between warring factions in the Liberian conflict which began in<BR>December 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing journalists at the Catholic Church of Liberia<BR>secretariat here late October, the religious leaders also said<BR>that they have noticed with a great deal of disappointment and<BR>dissatisfaction that there are serious attempts to foment<BR>religious hostility between adherents of Christianity and Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Inter-Faith Mediation Committee's press conference, the<BR>first since the sitting of Liberia's Six-man Council of State on<BR>September 1, the religious leaders criticized a recent call by the<BR>Elections Commission (ECOM) for political parties to begin<BR>preparing to organise for elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;To ask parties to organize for elections at this time when we<BR>have crucial issues of safe corridors, safe havens, disarmament,<BR>etc. is very disappointing. It is an indication here that we are<BR>on our way to another Angola,&quot; noted the Committee headed by Dr.<BR>Rev. Roland Diggs of the Lutheran Church of Liberia. Liberians are<BR>scheduled to hold elections in October 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said the religious leaders; &quot;If such developments are not<BR>discouraged and brought to an immediate end, they it may not only<BR>derail the peace process, but also lead the Liberian people into<BR>another endless and destructive religious warfare that is even<BR>more sensitive and dangerous than the present civil war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Inter-Faith Mediation Committee has therefore called on the<BR>six-man Council of State to understand and appreciate the fact<BR>that unless they learn to work together in unison, good faith, and<BR>love, the chances of genuine peace and the restoration of<BR>democracy in Liberia remains at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six-man State Council was sworn in on September 1, 1995<BR>with the mandate of running Liberia until elections are held in<BR>October 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ruling council was a culmination of this year's August 20<BR>peace agreement signed in Abuja, Nigeria, effectively ending<BR>perennial wrangling over power-sharing between warring factions<BR>following an earlier peace accord signed in Ghana in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brokered by Nigeria and Ghana, the latter which holds the<BR>chairmanship of the Economic Community of West African States<BR>(ECOWAS), the Abuja agreement was signed by all seven warring<BR>factions. The factions are: the Charles Taylor-led National<BR>Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), United Liberation Movement of<BR>Liberia (ULIMO-K) of Alhaji Kromah, Ulimo-J the Liberia Peace<BR>Council (LPC), Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), Lofa Defence Force<BR>(LDF) and the NPFL - Central Revolutionary Council (CRC). Less<BR>known university professor Wilton Sankawulo was unanimously<BR>endorsed as chairman of the State Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another development, the Archbishop of the Catholic Church<BR>of Liberia, His Holiness, Michael K. Francis has called as to<BR>Liberians to voice their concern about insecurity, continued<BR>harassment and intimidation of peaceful citizens by fighters in<BR>the country, when in fact they (Liberian people) have given them<BR>their demands: &quot;To have political power and give up guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The factionalization of Government and the slow pace in the<BR>peace process will not usher genuine peace in the country unless<BR>Government can address issues affecting the survival of its<BR>people,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Delivering his homily at the Sacred Heart Cathedral to mark<BR>the home-going of five Catholic nuns and one priest killed during<BR>the infamous &quot;Operation Octopus&quot; in 1992, the Archbi shop said,<BR>&quot;The longer the fracticidal conflict continues the more hardened<BR>we will become.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will be difficult to reconcile with each other if Liberian<BR>factions are not sincere in asking for forgiveness, he said. He<BR>deplored &quot;the unfortunate arrogance on the part of those who have<BR>brought this evil on the Liberian people&quot; and contributed in<BR>&quot;reopening wounds inflicted by them (factions).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic prelate noted, &quot;evil warlords parade in our<BR>society and in the city that they tried to destroy, treating the<BR>Liberian people they inflicted so much pain on, suffering and<BR>destruction, as if they are brute animals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that more than two months have passed since the<BR>six man Council of State was established yet peace remains<BR>elusive. The outspoken Archbishop regretted that instead of<BR>disarmament, the process of factionalization is going on in the<BR>whole country. He further questioned the sincerity of the warlords<BR>who claimed that once they were on the Council of State they<BR>would start disarmament but instead, they continue to prolong the<BR>sufferings of the Liberian s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Archbishop also criticised attacks on the freedom of the<BR>press, freedom of speech, the use of state-owned media to<BR>manipulate citizens, &quot;the immoral values creeping into our<BR>society, the lack of political will to free and fair commission<BR>and armed robberies.&quot;<BR>-0Kenya</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arusha - The United Nations tribunal set up to investigate the<BR>1994 massacres in Rwanda that killed up to a million people will<BR>not open its offices in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha<BR>until December 1, the tribunal clerk Andronico Adede announced<BR>here on November 1, the same day the tribunal was scheduled to<BR>open office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Adede, a Kenyan who works in the political division of the<BR>UN headquarters in New York, said: &quot;I negotiated with the<BR>landlords and we agreed to take a section of the Arusha<BR>International Conference Centre.&quot; But the office will only become<BR>operational on December 1 after being refurnished, Adede said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arusha, a town of 300,000 residents, was designated last<BR>February by the UN Security Council as the headquarters of the<BR>tribunal set up to probe the 1994 genocide that killed between<BR>500,000 and one million people, most of them minority Tutsis and<BR>moderates from the Hutu majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tribunal's chief prosecutor, South African Judge Richard<BR>Goldstone, said that indictments would be issued by the end of<BR>1995 and trials would begin early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Arusha Conference Centre served as the site for peace talks<BR>in 1993 that led to an accord designed to put an end to interof the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), composed of Rwandan exiles<BR>ethnic bloodshed between Hutu government troops and rebel Tutsis<BR>that had lived in Uganda for more than three decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The RPF seized power in Kigali in July last year after the<BR>death in a plane-crash near Kigali of Presidents Juvenal<BR>Habyarimana of Rwanda and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi, both<BR>Hutus, triggering the Hutu-Tutsi ethnic backlash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some two million ethnic Hutus fled Rwanda and took refuge in<BR>neighbouring Zaire, Tanzania and Kenya after the Tutsi minority<BR>took power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The now RPF-dominated Rwandan government led by Pasteur<BR>Bizimungu has accused Kenya of &quot;protecting&quot; those who organised<BR>last year's massacres in Rwanda. Recently, President Daniel arap<BR>Moi roused a storm of international protest when he said Nairobi<BR>would reject summonses addressed to Rwandan Hutus who fled to<BR>Kenya after the massacre of mainly Tutsis by Hutu extremists whom<BR>the tribunal is now seeking to bring to trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kenyan leader later toned down his statement saying he<BR>would not protest perpetrators of the genocide, but called for the<BR>mandate of the UN Tribunal to be broadened to include an<BR>investigation of the shooting down of the plane that killed<BR>Habyarimana and Ntaryamira.<BR>-0Liberia</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abidjan - Some 6,000 of Ivory Coast's ethnic Baules have fled<BR>their farm camps in the country's southwest to escape ethnic<BR>violence that erupted there following the October 22 presidential<BR>elections won by incumbent President Henri Konan Bedie of the<BR>ruling Ivory Coast Democratic Party (PDCI).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unconfirmed reports of massacres committed by members of a<BR>rival ethnic group have not yet been verified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Baules, now staying under military protection in the<BR>region's capital Gagnoa, 230 kilometres northwest of Abidjan, have<BR>said they are afraid of attacks by Betes, the ethnic group that<BR>forms the bulk of the region's population, while others also spoke<BR>of massacres and of whole villages being razed to the ground.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as of October 30, only two people had been confirmed dead<BR>as a result of the clashes between the two groups since the<BR>October 22 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ivory Coast's opposition is led by a Bete. During the<BR>presidential poll that brought a landslide victory to Konan Bedie,<BR>the opposition's boycott of the poll was most widely and actively<BR>carried out in the Bete area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On October 19, the day before the Baules began to arrive in<BR>Gagnoa, the national news agency reported that 18 people, mainly<BR>women and children, had been &quot;massacred&quot; in a Baule camp near the<BR>town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ivorian military has said only one body was found when the<BR>incident was investigated, but the news agency has not issued a<BR>correction. According to military officials, villages have been<BR>looted, and some even burnt but the incidents occurred after the<BR>Baules had left. The military described these acts as &quot;vandalism&quot;<BR>rather than systematic or premeditated attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With parliamentary elections less than a month away, the Baulecountry's politicians and the press.<BR>Bete issue has, meanwhile, become a propaganda tool for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since independence in 1960, Ivory Coast has been ruled by<BR>Baules. In the late 1960s, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, the<BR>country's first president since independence from French colonial<BR>rule in 1960 until his death in 1993, encouraged Baule farmers to<BR>move from their eastern savannah homelands to cultivate cocoa in<BR>more fertile forested regions occupied mainly by Betes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both sides are now accusing each other of &quot;tribalising&quot; the<BR>debate and there have been suggestions in the press that<BR>politicians are using both ethnic groups as pawns in their power<BR>games and even providing them with weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On October 30, the pro-government newspaper La Nouvelle<BR>Republique denounced the &quot;direct responsibility of certain<BR>leaders&quot; of the opposition &quot;for these atrocities, while Henri<BR>Dasse, an opposition member of parliament in Gagnoa claimed the<BR>ruling party &quot;would like to see 500 Baules killed in the area to<BR>make devils out of us.&quot; Dasse believed that Bedie's party was<BR>running a &quot;brainwashing campaign&quot; in the run-up to parliamentary<BR>elections later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1970, some 4,000 people, mainly Betes, were killed when the<BR>army was called in to quell unrest in the Gagnoa area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The historic rivalry between the Baule and Bete groups, which<BR>mirrors the political divisions in Ivory Coast, was revived in the<BR>run-up to the October 22 presidential election. Although a number<BR>of attempts at reconciliation were made in the years that<BR>followed, the killings did not become a public issue until the<BR>advent of multi-partism in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recent events in Gagnoa suggest that the nightmare of the<BR>Baule-Bete issues is not yet over and would probably spill over<BR>during the coming campaigns for the November legislative elections<BR>and the municipal polls in December.<BR>-0Rwanda</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khartoum - In a surprise early dry season offensive, the<BR>mainstream Sudan Peoples Liberation Army (SPLA) of John Garang,<BR>say they overrun Sudanese government garrisons at Palutaka and<BR>Parajob in Eastern Equatoria on October 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the first victory of its kind for the SPLA since they<BR>suffered a series of reverses, including the loss of their own<BR>garrison town, Torit in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports here confirm that a major battle took place in<BR>Palutaka(Parajok(Bor and Mugui areas, the latter an important<BR>junction town to Juba and Torit in the South.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, a Sudanese government statement blamed Uganda for the<BR>attack and charged that the offensive was led by three Ugandan<BR>brigades of the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF) comprising<BR>nearly 2,000 men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement pointed out that President Museveni &quot;told Uganda<BR>Parliament two months ago that he was going to attack Sudan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni's threat to attack Ugandan rebel bases in Sudan<BR>followed a series of attacks by the Lords Resistance Army of<BR>Uganda rebel Joseph Kony, one of which in late March this year<BR>resulted in the massacre of 200 Acholi tribes people in Kitgum<BR>District of northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni says the rebels are armed and supported by the<BR>Sudanese with bases in Palutaka(Parajok areas of Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Early April, Uganda severed diplomatic ties with the Sudan, her<BR>neighbour in the north. A series of reconciliation meetings<BR>mediated by Libya and Malawi failed to resolve the differences<BR>between the two nations who have traded accusations about rebel<BR>movements on each other's territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rebel spokesperson Pajok Amoun said in the Kenyan capital<BR>Nairobi that they had killed or wounded or captured most of the<BR>3,000 troops at Parajok, while the remaining had been put to<BR>flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He claimed large quantities of weapons including three tanks<BR>and over 20 tracks had been seized by the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amoun made no mention of the Lords Resistance Army rebels<BR>believed to be at Palutak(Parajok when the camps were attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also denied that Uganda had helped the Sudanese rebels. &quot;The<BR>reason Khartoum has cooked up stories about the Ugandan<BR>involvement is because they already told their people that the<BR>SPLA is finished as a fighting force,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers say if the victory by the Sudanese rebels is as<BR>extensive as they claim, it will seriously disrupt any dry season<BR>offensive that they had in the pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will also substantially curtail the activities of the Lords<BR>Resistance Army on Ugandan territory.<BR>-0Ivory Coast</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>November 16, 1995 (19951116)<BR>by Mercy Wambui<BR> Johannesburg - With the installation of the first democratically<BR>elected government in South Africa last year, expectations for<BR>change were high among the majority black people. And the<BR>country's first black African President boosted such hopes through<BR>the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) which promises<BR>at least five million housing units by the year 2000. However, the<BR>question many ask is, can the blacks, majority of whom the<BR>programme was intended for, afford to pay even for subsidised<BR>housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He is the worst of them all!: says Michel van Gutten (not his<BR>real name) driving at break neckspeed and pointing at a campaign<BR>mugshot of South African President Nelson Mandela.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He promised to build 10 million houses, places to live in, but<BR>not even one has been built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He now says that the government does not have money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As he continues amidst four-lettered words, this writer seeks<BR>to know if Michel is interested in the government's attempt to<BR>racially integrate the running of the country, being part of that<BR>process.&quot; Of course there is no such thing as integration as long<BR>as Mandela is president!! Do you expect me (white) to integrate<BR>with the blacks who are building squatter camps everywhere... they<BR>(read Blacks) don't have jobs so they can't live in decent house,<BR>and now they are a threat to us (whites)... they steal, they<BR>kill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This racist slur cannot get worse than it already sounds. After<BR>years of racial segregation, the South Africa is not about to turn<BR>into a haven for blacks despite the fact that they are exercising<BR>self-rule. Economic disparities run wide and equal opportunities<BR>for blacks are still few and far between.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like most Sub-Saharan African countries, South Africa though<BR>considered the most developed black-led country in the world, is<BR>not exempt from housing problems. For many blacks who live in<BR>squatter camps, the right to housing as enshrined in the<BR>constitution is a far outcry from the reality they face daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite efforts by the Nelson Mandela-led government of<BR>National Unity well intended commitment and seven-point plan to<BR>eradicate homelessness, a social ill whose roots were watered by<BR>the former apartheid regime, the challenge facing the nation is<BR>almost overwhelming as is evident from statistics provided by<BR>Wendy Ovens and Abdou Maling Simone, from Planact, a Johannesburg<BR>based non- governmental organisation specializing in human<BR>settlements issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statistics read; the richest five per cent of the<BR>population, mostly white, own 88 per cent of all private property,<BR>two thirds of the African population live below the poverty line,<BR>about 53 percent of the white labour force matriculate compared to<BR>a poor 2.2 per cent of blacks and infant mortality among whites is<BR>7.3 per 1000 against a worrying 52.8 per 1000 among blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the apartheid regime used housing as an instrument to<BR>manipulate, separate and regiment citizens by denying them access<BR>to living in the city and kept them in townships, this has changed<BR>dramatically since the first all race elections in April 1994. The<BR>breaking down of the walls of apartheid has tremendously increased<BR>in-migration to cities by both South African nationals, refugees<BR>and economic opportunists from other parts of Africa.<BR>Unfortunately, the influx has paralled increase in organised<BR>violence and crime such as drug-trafficking and commercial sex<BR>activity in the search for economic survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currently, the rate of urban population growth in South Africa<BR>stands at 4.3 per cent bringing the total population of urbanites<BR>to 23.6 million in a country of about 42 million people. Available<BR>statistics show that 65 per cent of black dwelling units are<BR>informal, with the majority consisting of backyard shacks in<BR>townships. Evidently, the government has a staggering challenge of<BR>meeting a housing backlog of 1.3 million units. Its Reconstruction<BR>and Development Programme (RDP) has a target of at least one<BR>million houses in the next five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although well-meaning, the implementation of the RDP increment<BR>housing policy is a slow, tedious and frustrating process which is<BR>simply not satisfactory. Its current housing policy comprises<BR>among seven points, a subsidy scheme to provide housing<BR>opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics argue that providing housing through subsidies assumes<BR>that other basic issues are already well taken care of. &quot;It is<BR>based on private sector models whereby people take up mortgages.<BR>The problem with mortgages is that they are dependent on one's<BR>ability to pay back. The large per cent of homeless blacks cannot<BR>afford mortgages at all,&quot; they note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Planact, points out that the number of housing units built in<BR>the last one year is just about 10,000, falling way below its one<BR>million target for the next five years. For the two-thirds of<BR>Africans living below the poverty line and those who have no form<BR>of income however low, subsidies are out of question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process of acquiring loans, qualifying for loans, and<BR>eventual payment is already painstaking. There are also many other<BR>issues at stake such as lack of education, adequate health<BR>facilities and general dysfunctioning of communities which means<BR>that people's preoccupation is not just about a roof over one's<BR>head, but about provision of clean water, lighting, education and<BR>basic health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So what solutions do human settlements experts envision? Wendy<BR>Ovens, suggests that the current housing subsidy programme would<BR>make the process of accessing housing to blacks possible by making<BR>it a down-up approach as opposed to the top-down structure. &quot;The<BR>government should ensure that housing targeted for a certain<BR>location should involve the community right from the beginning.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The long awaited general election in Tanzania seems<BR>to have generated more confusion than excitement, especially with<BR>the anticipated repeat of the poll in the capital, Dar-es-Salaam.<BR>Can the irregularities prompting fresh polls in Dar-es-Salaam be<BR>ruled out in Zanzibar, Pemba and the rest of Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reliable sources in Tanzania say international observers<BR>representing donor nations, who monitored the first general<BR>elections in the island of Zanzibar on October 22, have now<BR>written to outgoing President Ali Hassan Mwinyi stating that Seif<BR>Sheriff Hamad, the opposition cand idate for the Civic United<BR>Front (CUF) is the winner of Zanzibar's presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Island of Zanzibar (traditionally called Unguja) and its<BR>sister island of Pemba, are members of the union with mainland<BR>Tanzania.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They held their parliamentary and presidential polls a week<BR>earlier than mainland Tanzania where the elections which started<BR>on October 29 have been described as &quot;absolutely chaotic .&quot; In the<BR>capital of mainland Tanzania, Dar-es-Salaam, an opposition<BR>stronghold, elections are to be repeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the time of going to press, the chairman of the National<BR>Convention for Reconstruction (NCCR-Mageuzi) Mr Augustine Mrema<BR>said that opposition parties would file a court injunction to halt<BR>the on-going general election process in Tanzania. Mrema also<BR>indicated th at the Electoral Commission's call for a repeat of<BR>elections in Dar-es-Salaam was a pointer to possibilities of<BR>irregularities in the rest of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International observers were angered by the whole election<BR>process in Zanzibar where they cited questionable practices such<BR>as police intimidation and refusal to register perceived<BR>opposition supporters in rural areas. Tanzania officials cannot<BR>readily ignore the frustration of donors who provide more than 50<BR>per cent of budgetary support for the economy of this East African<BR>country with a population of 25 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zanzibari incumbent Salmin Amour of the Chama Cha<BR>Mapinduzi (CCM) was declared winner by the Zanzibar Electoral<BR>Commission (ZEC), which gave him a very narrow margin of 50.2 per<BR>cent (165,271 ballots) against CUF's Hamad, who got 49.8 per cent<BR>with 163,706 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was clear that all was not well or transparent. Judge Zubeir<BR>Mzee, Chairman of the ZEC did not entertain any questions from<BR>reporters after his declaration of Amour as winner on October 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CCM also won the Parliamentary elections by 27 seats to 23 for<BR>CUF. CUF swept all 20 parliamentary seats in Pemba, meaning they<BR>only managed three seats in Zanzibar. There are 50 seats in the<BR>Zanzibari parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the elections on October 22 all results were expected in<BR>by the night of October 23, at the latest. The total number of<BR>votes cast was less than 350,000 for the two islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it took another 36 to 48 hours for parliamentary<BR>results to be declared officially, while the presidential poll<BR>results were announced 72 hours later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of the frustrations caused by silence from the ZEC,<BR>Dar-es-Salaam Television refused to wait any longer and announced<BR>on October 24, that Seif Sheriff Hamad, was the winnner with<BR>164,312 against Amour's 155,787 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked where he obtained the results, Mbela Mwanatongoni, head<BR>of Dar-es-Salaam Television said the station relied on impeccable<BR>sources who had witnessed several recounts of the p residential<BR>vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His deputy, Mr. Ligulu charged that members of ZEC appeared to<BR>be hiding the whole day. &quot;What do you do as a journalist when they<BR>are determined to hide the information? Will you not find it out<BR>any way you can?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although he was being declared the winner, Hamad had as early<BR>as October 23 dism issed the elections as a fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He demanded a recount of the votes and scrutiny of forms used<BR>at the polling stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that at a number of stations namely Kitopeni,<BR>Malandege, Kurhani - the number of votes polled exceeded that of<BR>registered voters. He also claimed that illiterate Zanzibaris had<BR>been tricked to vote for CCM and that army and police based on the<BR>Islands had been ordered to vote for the ruling party. However,<BR>Chama Cha Mapinduzi Deputy Secretary General for Zanzibar Ali<BR>Amier, dismissed Hamad's charges out of hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But things changed dramatically once it became obvious that<BR>Amour was losing the count in the presidential ballot. Ali Amier<BR>issued another angry statement disowning the elections entirely.<BR>&quot;We are not demanding just a recount; What we are demanding is<BR>that the whole elections be done again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZEMOG, constituting a group of local observers in Zanzibar,<BR>said the first multiparty elections in the islands was fraught<BR>with problems right from the beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof. Harub Osman of ZEMOG said the whole registration exercise<BR>had been flawed in the run-up to the elections, including<BR>interference by security agents who intimidated many in the<BR>opposition camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof. Chris Peter decried the poor organisation on polling day<BR>itself. He did not understand why there were only two vehicles for<BR>the purpose of distributing voting material to polling centres.<BR>Although voters arrived at polling stations as early as 6.00 am.<BR>many of the centres opened late , forcing officials to wait<BR>sometimes up to midnight, before counting of votes could start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International observers are angered that United Nations<BR>Development Programme (UNDP) and the Organisation of African Unity<BR>(OAU) rushed to endorse the results of the Zanzibari elections<BR>despite endless flaws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some media outlets in Zanzibar reported that Salmin Amour had<BR>made an unexpected trip to Dar es Salaam to consult with the<BR>overall head of the Tanzanian Electoral Commission Ju dge Lewis<BR>Makame. Judge Makame has been accused of being a CCM puppet, bent<BR>on rigging the vote.Calls for his resignation are growing<BR>following the confusion during the polls in the capital, Dar es<BR>Salaam on October 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CUF is considered the party of the &quot;Arabs&quot; while the CCM in<BR>Zanzibar is the continuation of the old Afro-Shirazi party of the<BR>late Abeid Karume who led Zanzibar after the revolution of 1964.<BR>The revolution ended the reign of the Sultans who trace their<BR>roots to Oman in the Arab Peninsular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zanzibar is famous as the &quot;spice islands&quot;. In history Zanzibar<BR>is also remembered as the 19th century slave trade market centre<BR>for slaves en route to Arabia, Asia and the Americas.<BR>-0South Africa</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>November 16, 1995 (19951116)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairoibi - In 1970 former Uganda President Milton Obote threw<BR>out hundreds of Kenyan immigrant families who had settled in<BR>Uganda for generations. In 1982 he repeated the same act on<BR>thousands of Rwandese immigrants all over Uganda. Our APS<BR>Correspondent reports on a study by an Asian-Uganda scholar who<BR>argues that the enforced eviction against the Rwandese led to<BR>Obote's own eventual overthrow and contributed greatly to the<BR>formation of the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Daniel arap Moi's much publicised and criticised<BR>statement on October 2 to the effect that Kenya would be reluctant<BR>to hand over to the United Nations Tribunal on Rwanda those<BR>implicated in the genocide in that country one year ago, has<BR>ignited discussions on an issue of fundamental importance to<BR>justice and peace in the whole region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kenyan leader later softened his stand, indicating that his<BR>country was not working against the Tribunal's efforts to bring to<BR>book those (be it Hutu or Tutsi) responsible for the 1994<BR>massacres in which some one million Rwandese died. However, he<BR>maintained that Kenya wanted to be told who had killed Rwandese<BR>President Juvenal Habyariamana and the Burundi leader Cyprien<BR>Ntaryamira in a mysterious plane crash in the capital of Rwanda,<BR>Kigali, on the evening of April 6, 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Habyarimana was considered a good friend of President Moi. The<BR>UN War Crimes Tribunal on Rwanda, was due to open in Arusha<BR>Tanzania, on November 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barely four days after the international furore sparked by<BR>Moi's original statement, Zambian officials announced the arrest<BR>of eight Rwandese nationals suspected to have played a key role in<BR>the genocide. Reports say the suspects include a former mayor of<BR>Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Undeterred by criticism from Kenya African National Union<BR>(KANU) ruling party st alwarts, nine Kenyan opposition Members of<BR>Parliament returned home on October 29 at the end of a three-day<BR>fact-finding mission to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Led by Leader of the Official Opposition Wamalwa Kijana of the<BR>Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD-Kenya) the nine<BR>legislators, who also included Democratic Party (DP) Chairman Mwai<BR>Kibaki and FORD-Asili Secretary General Martin Shikuku, held<BR>discussions with Rwandese President Pasteur Birimungu, Prime<BR>Minister Celestin Rusigema and Vice President Paul Kagame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Upon their return, the opposition MPs criticised the<BR>governments of Kenya and France for their seemingly uncooperative<BR>attitude in the efforts to restore peace and reconciliat on in<BR>Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is estimated that as many as 400 perpetrators of the carnage<BR>in Rwanda have made homes in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi and the<BR>coastal city of Mombasa. They comprise the cream of former power<BR>brokers in Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among those believed to be residing in Kenya, is the man said<BR>to have financed the Radio Milles Collines, the radio station that<BR>incited the panga and grenade wielding gangs against the inyenziindividuals live in exclusive apartments where tenants pay<BR>(cockroaches as the minority Tutsi were called). Some of these<BR>substantial rents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, whose name has been closely<BR>linked to the formation and support of the Rwanda Patriotic Front<BR>(RPF) that seized power in Kigali after unprecedent orgy of<BR>killings, commenting on Moi's misgivings about the War Tribunal's<BR>terms of reference said it was his (Moi's) business if he did not<BR>wish to cooperate with the tribunal. Museveni continued, &quot;genocide<BR>is a crime against mankind. I think it is an obligation, and not<BR>simply voluntary, to hand over these people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwanda's Vice President and Defence Minister Paul Kagame cast<BR>aspersions on the moral uprightness of the authorities in Nairobi,<BR>accusing them of sharing the same views with the criminals who<BR>killed up to one million Tutsi and moderate Hutus last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kagame advised Moi to look to France for the material evidence<BR>relating to the rocket attack that brought down the executive jet<BR>in which the two presidents were killed. &quot;The fact is, the<BR>material evidence was carried to France.&quot; French military<BR>advisors, said to have acted at the behest of hardline elements in<BR>Rwanda are among the suspects thought to have brought down the<BR>presidential executive jet on the evening of April 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To many observers, Kenya was clearly targeting Ugandan<BR>President Yoweri Museveni .  Zaire, too has criticised Museveni's<BR>links with the RPF. Significantly also, in reply to Kagame's angry<BR>denounciation of the Kenyan stand, a Kenyan government statement<BR>called Kagame &quot;a Uganda.&quot; Kagame was born of Tutsi parents who<BR>fled to Uganda after the 1959 upheavals in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a new study by an Asian-Ugandan scholar, Prof. Mahmood<BR>Mamdani, suggests it is far too simplistic to blame Museveni as<BR>the instigator of the RPF in 1990. Mamdani's study was published<BR>as a series in the government owned daily New Vision in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Partly titled &quot;In the footsteps of Hutu Tutsi killing,&quot; the<BR>author shows the genesis of the RPF was a complex dynamic of<BR>forces, not least the violent uprooting of thousands of Rwandese<BR>migrants in many parts of Uganda after former President Milton<BR>Obote returned to power for the second time in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It must be emphasised that Dr. Mamdani's study is primarily an<BR>attempt to understand how peace and justice could be achieved in<BR>Rwanda following the upheavals of 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During his first period of office in 1970, President Obote made<BR>a similar error of judgement when he uprooted thousands of Luo<BR>families from Kenya who had made Uganda their home. The late<BR>President Jomo Kenyatta refused to see Obote when the latter<BR>arrived in Nairobi after he was toppled in a military coup in<BR>January 1971. The Luo inhabit the western part of Kenya,<BR>neighbouring Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof. Mamdami argues that what became known as the &quot;RPF<BR>invasion of Rwanda in 1990 also needs to be understood as an<BR>expulsion of Rwandese refugees from Uganda.&quot; Mamdani says that a<BR>refugee self-consciousness became deeply rooted only among the<BR>refugees who fled to Uganda and not those who moved to Belgian<BR>Congo or Tanganyika in 1958.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reason for this acute awareness of their plight, says<BR>Mamdani, was that &quot;successive governments in Uganda considered the<BR>children of refugees also to be refugees.&quot; Many of these immigrant<BR>children had to hide their identities and pretend to be Baganda,<BR>Banyankole, Banyoro...&quot;The anti refugee prejudice was promoted by<BR>the State and shared by many in society at large,&quot; he claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To many Rwandese, the expulsion of Kenyan Luos by Obote in 1970<BR>heralded their own expulsion. After all, wonders Mamdani, &quot;had not<BR>the Obote I regime, as early as 1969, ordered the registration of<BR>all Rwandese refugees in Uganda, a move many considered a prelude<BR>to their own expulsion?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rwandese expulsion came true, though under Obote's second<BR>period in office later in 1982/1983. It started in October 1, 1982<BR>and involved local chiefs and the youth wing of the Uganda Peoples<BR>Congress (UPC) of Obote, and paramilitary special forces. They<BR>targeted Banyarwa nda all over Uganda's southwest. Mamdani quotes<BR>witnesses who said &quot;there were killings, rapes and maimings&quot; and<BR>their homes were destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over 40,000 fled to Rwanda before Kigali closed the door on its<BR>side of the border. Many youths fled into the bush and contributed<BR>to the surge of guerrilla activity by the National Resistance Army<BR>(NRA) of President Museveni who shot his way to power three years<BR>later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similar action was repeated against the Rwandese in Masaka,<BR>Teso, Lango and elsewhere in Uganda. This explains why the Luwero<BR>Triangle in Central Uganda, an area whose population included<BR>large numbers of Rwandese migrants, became the focus of the<BR>guerrilla activity against Obote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later, the Rwandese who had contributed to the removal of Obote<BR>in 1985 broke away from the NRA and headed south to Rwanda after<BR>Uganda's Parliament barred non-Ugandans from owning land in the<BR>country in the landbill of 1990. The Rwandese then felt betrayed<BR>by Ugandans according to Mamdani's research.<BR>-0Tanzania</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zanzibar - The ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM-revolutionary)<BR>party won the election for 50 members of parliament in the<BR>Tanzanian islands of Zanzibar and Pemba in results announced<BR>October 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Final figures announced on Zanzibar Radio, three days after the<BR>polls gave the CCM 26 seats to 24 for the opposition Civic United<BR>Front (CUF). The CUF won all 21 seats on Pembaa nd three of the 29<BR>seats on Zanzibar.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The results opened the way for the announcement of the vote for<BR>an executive president who will have the power to appoint<BR>additional members of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On October 24, a win for the CCM in these first multi-party<BR>poll since Zanzibar attained independence from British protection<BR>in 1963, had appeared clear-cut to the extent that the ruling<BR>party supporters celebrated in the streets while CUF declared it<BR>had been robbed of victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But on October 25, one unofficial count of voting in the last<BR>three constituencies gave victory to the opposition, while another<BR>count-equally unofficial - gave the two parties 25 seats each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Zanzibar Electoral Commission official said the results of<BR>the last three constituencies were being counted, recounted and<BR>counted again before being issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But key to the results of the elections in the twin Indian<BR>Ocean islands was the yet-to-be announced vote for its executive<BR>president, who will have the power to appoint additional members<BR>of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Equally crucial to the future of the islands, which are part of<BR>the United Republic of Tanzania, will be the results of the<BR>national vote for the president and vice- president of the union<BR>and the union parliament seated at Dodoma in the centre of the<BR>Tanzanian mainland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national elections, on October 29, will also be the first<BR>multi-party poll since mainland Tanganyika's independence from<BR>British colonial rule in 1961.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CUF's presidential candidate for Zanzibar was Seif Shariff<BR>Hamad, a former prime minister who subsequently spent 30 months in<BR>prison on state of security charges, accused of having retained<BR>secret state papers after he was ousted and expelled from the then<BR>sole ruling CCM party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hamad had been so sure of losing early last week that he told<BR>reporters that his supporters were &quot;frustrated&quot; because they had<BR>been &quot;robbed of their victory,&quot; charging that there was voteSaying that those who voted included &quot;lunatics and the dead&quot;,<BR>rigging and called for fresh elections.<BR>Hamad had declared : &quot;We will not recognise nor shall we be<BR>obedient to a government that will be formed as a resu lt of these<BR>unfair elections.&quot;<BR>-0Rwanda</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Some 20,000 African Inland Church (AIC) faithful,<BR>among them President Daniel arap Moi, celebrated a special<BR>thanksgiving and worship service here in late October marking the<BR>100th anniversary of the church in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The thanksgiving service held in the city outskirts, marked the<BR>culmination of centenary celebrations which began January this<BR>year throughout AIC's 3,000 local churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from President Moi the day-long celebrations were also<BR>graced by Cabinet Members, Members of Parliament, clergy and<BR>visitors from Australia, the United Kingdom, Tanzania, Malawi,<BR>Zaire, Uganda and the Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They sang and prayed as they braved a heavy downpour during the<BR>ceremonies which started at 9 am and ended at 4 pm local time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Ezekiel Birech, the AIC head in Kenya, and Dr. Dick<BR>Underson conducted the elaborate religious ceremony which included<BR>the cutting of five cakes symbolising the origin of the church,<BR>its plantation in Kenya, its logo, the Bible and evangelisation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Noting that Peter Cameroon Scott was only 28 when he founded<BR>the AIC in Kenya, the President urged the youth to take the lead<BR>in evangelisation campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Established in Kenya as the African Inland Mission (AIM) in<BR>1985, AIC's first mission station was set up in Kalamba, in<BR>present day Makueni district of eastern Kenya. The church which is<BR>said to have started with &quot;no budget, no salaries and no fixed<BR>income&quot; currently boasts of 2,000,000 members and adherents<BR>countrywide, 3,000 churches, runs 18 training institutions, 55<BR>medical and health institutions and 24 children's homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peter Cameroon Scott lived a brief, hectic and very productive<BR>life. Born of poor God-loving Scottish parents in 1867, Peter<BR>Scott was raised in Oshwal Street, London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1889 A.B. Simpson, founder of the International Missionary<BR>Alliance, accepted Scott to train in New York. The following year<BR>the young man was ordained as an Alliance missionary just a day<BR>before he departed for Banana at the mouth of West Africa's river<BR>Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two years later Scott became so ill that he had to be carried<BR>to Banana unconscious and later to England for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1895, together with a group of missionary enthusiasts,<BR>including Arthur Pierson, and Charles Hurburt they established<BR>African Inland Mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AIC also owns a chain of Christian bookshops, a radio<BR>studio, a popular Christian magazine (Today in Africa), and has<BR>established its own African Missionary Society with more than 50<BR>missionaries serving in Kenya and neighbouring Uganda. Since 1945,<BR>the church has ordained 350 ministers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) General<BR>Secretary Rev. Jose Chipenda has asked churches in Africa to help<BR>their young people exploit individual talents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a photo exhibition, mounted by participants in the<BR>1995 Media Production Course at the AACC Communication Training<BR>Centre on October 23, Chipenda said although the youth are highly<BR>talented and full of ideas they need help to exploit their gifts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The photo exhibition, part of the annual six-month media<BR>production course, was a culmination of a three-week intensive<BR>photography course conducted by a local seasoned photo-journalist,<BR>Sam Ouma.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Chipenda challenged the course participants, seven women<BR>and 11 men from 12 African countries, to exploit the knowledge<BR>they had acquired from the course for the benefit of the church<BR>and Africa in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are today living in a world, where modern mode of<BR>communication such as photography has become part and parcel of<BR>evangelisation. It is up to us to avail this knowledge to<BR>Christians who will later on exploit it effectively for the<BR>benefit of the church,&quot; noted the AACC head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The photographs depicted activities such as sports, cultural<BR>dances, motor rally, wildlife, religious festivities, tourism and<BR>farming among the Kenyan people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The photo exhibition was attended by among other invited<BR>guests, chief photographers from Kenya's leading dailies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Yusuf Wachira, chief photographer with the private-owned<BR>Daily Nation, challenged course participants against taking<BR>photography as a mere hobby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It has to be serious business for serious people carrying with<BR>it both challenges and risks. Its impact on the intended consumer<BR>depends wholly on the photographer himself and his tools of trade,<BR>the camera being one of them,&quot; said Wachira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Yahya Mohammed from another independent daily, the East<BR>African Standard commended churches for acknowledging the crucial<BR>role played by photography in Christian ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six-month media production course is coordinated by a<BR>consultant in communication training, Mr. Polycarp Omollo-Ochilo<BR>who is also a lecturer at the Nairobi University School of<BR>Journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the course, students were taught various techniques in<BR>communication such as electronic media script writing, drama,<BR>video, the act of interviewing and photography.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abidjan - Outgoing Ivorian President Henri Konan Bedie won rebut questions were raised about the number of people who turned<BR>election in Ivory Coast's presidential poll held on October 22,<BR>out to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to provisional results released by the Interior<BR>Ministry on October 23, Bedie won the elections, polling 96.44 per<BR>cent of the votes against 3.56 per cent for his only opponent<BR>Francis Wodie of the opposition Ivorian Workers' Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The results of the elections, boycotted by the main opposition,<BR>must be reviewed by the Constitutional Council to become official.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to official figures, an estimated 56 per cent of the<BR>country's 3.8 million registered voters turned up to cast their<BR>votes at polling stations throughout the country. Legisl ative<BR>elections are to follow next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But celebrations of his victory by the ruling Ivory Coast<BR>Democratic Party (PDCI ) have been dampened by violence before and<BR>during the elections that left more than a dozen people dead,<BR>according to unofficial estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the weeks leading up to the poll, eight people died in<BR>opposition protests marked by increasing violence as demonstrators<BR>clashed with both police and Bedie supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were violent incidents on polling day on October 22, when<BR>at least two people died, although most observers were expecting<BR>worse, after the core of the opposition first announced they would<BR>not take part in the vote, but took a hardline and called for an<BR>&quot;active boycott&quot; and instructed supporters to do all they could to<BR>stop the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The call followed the refusal by Bedie to revise rules which<BR>the opposition claimed effectively barred one of their most<BR>favoured candidates, former Prime Minister Allassane Ouattara,<BR>from standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least five other people are said to have been massacred at a<BR>camp in a region outside Abidjan in election-related ethnic<BR>violence before the poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In several areas, the opposition succeeded in blocking access<BR>to polling booths by erecting roadblocks, while in others, polling<BR>stations were destroyed and ballot boxes and voting material burnt<BR>down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In at least two districts, voting was cancelled because the<BR>required equipment never arrived. However, voting at most polling<BR>stations proceeded peacefully, even at opposition strongholds such<BR>as Yopougon, a suburb of Abidjan, where several clashes with<BR>police occurred in the weeks before the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was, however, not clear whether those who stayed away had<BR>refused to accept the legitimacy of the poll, feared violent<BR>scenes at polling booths, or were simply apathetic about an<BR>election whose outcome could be predicted once it emerged that<BR>Bedie would only be opposed by a minor politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bedie, who became president without election when the country's<BR>first president Felix Houphouet-Boigny died in office in 1993, had<BR>been expected to win a five-year term easily, mainly due to lack<BR>of serious rivals.<BR>-0Africa-At-Large</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu conducted a<BR>thanksgiving service for 50 years of the United Nations at the<BR>Westminster Cathedral here on October 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The service coincided with the weeklong commemoration events,<BR>parties and speeches, at the UN headquarters in New York. The<BR>birthday events brought together more than 180 leaders from all<BR>over the world. The United Nations started as the league of<BR>Nations in 1945.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talking to journalists after the service here, the outspoken<BR>Cape Town Archbishop who is also president of the Nairobi-based<BR>All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) said rich nations should<BR>seek inspiration in the Bible to help solve the problems of<BR>underdevelopment and poverty. He repeated an impassioned plea for<BR>the rich nations to cancel the debts owed by poor nations<BR>particularly at this time when the United Nations was celebrating<BR>its 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The leaders of the rich nations should look to the Bible for<BR>inspiration. Every 50 years you make a new beginning - this is the<BR>jubilee principle in (the book of) Leviticus - you cancel any<BR>debts still owed; if there are slaves you set them free - it is a<BR>chance for a renewal for everybody, &quot; he appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu suggested that as a first step in this direction debtor<BR>(poor) nations should be given a moratorium under which they would<BR>be subjected to scrutiny, to see whether funds from cancelled<BR>debts would be put to projects to benefit the people and whether<BR>governments of beneficiary Third World nations would improve their<BR>human rights records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If genuine progress is being made, the debts must be<BR>cancelled,&quot; said Tutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Archbishop said he was optimistic the leaders of the<BR>industrialised world would see the pragmatism of taking such a<BR>course of action &quot;because of the good inherent in man. Even those<BR>who are agnostics or non believers, you don't have to persuade<BR>them that peace is better than war - this is the nobility of the<BR>human spirit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Archbishop Tutu's call comes two weeks after a coalition of<BR>American churches and churches under the umbrella of the All<BR>Africa Conference of Churches organised a series of demonstrations<BR>and other activities to increase awareness of the implication of<BR>the &quot;debt crisis&quot; that coincided with the World Bank/International<BR>Monetary Fund annual meeting that began in Washington D C on<BR>October 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The churches want debts owed to rich nations repealed and a new<BR>start made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And during his recent tour of Africa in September, Pope John<BR>Paul II made a special plea for debt burdened African nations. He<BR>urged the rich nations to have the courage to cancel the debt owed<BR>by African nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African nations alone owe more than $211 billion to the<BR>industrialised world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko has confirmed<BR>that he is against any deadlines for Rwandese refugees of Hutu<BR>origin to quit refugee camps in Goma, eastern Zaire, and return to<BR>their homeland, Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are more than one million Rwandese refugees on Zairean<BR>territory where they have lived in camps operated by the United<BR>Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for over one year<BR>now. They fled the country after the genocide that saw more than<BR>one million mainly Tutsis and moderate Hutus murdered by Hutu<BR>hardliners. The massacres were sparked by the April 6, 1994<BR>killing of Rwandese President Juvenal Habyarimana and his<BR>Burundian counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira in a suspicious plane<BR>crash in Kigali, the Rwandan capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mobutu told reporters here where he was attending the United<BR>Nations 50 anniversary celebrations: &quot;It is not proper for Zaire<BR>which has treated refugees like brothers to establish deadlines<BR>for them to leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His latest stand confirms similar sentiments he expressed<BR>earlier in a Belgian newspaper Le Soir. The Zairean Head of State<BR>is reported saying October 22 that he was opposed to the deadline<BR>set by Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo for all Rwandese<BR>refugees to leave Zaire by December 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kengo had made it clear that those who will not have met the<BR>deadline would be forcibly evicted by the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In August this year, Zairean troops acting on orders from the<BR>Prime Minister forcibly repatriated an estimated 12,000 refugees<BR>across the common border with Rwanda in the west, despite repeated<BR>international calls for Zaire to approach the matter in a<BR>humanitarian way. The UNHCR, other aid agencies and the<BR>international community asked Zaire to help implement voluntary<BR>repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his latest interview here, Mobutu did not explain why he had<BR>kept silent when Zairean troops were implementing forcible<BR>repatriation. However, observers believe that his statement is the<BR>final word on the matter and the Rwandese who do not wish to leave<BR>can stay on in Goma without harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Early October Rwandese, Zairean and UNHCR authorities concluded<BR>an amicable understanding to repatriate as many as 20,000 refugees<BR>every day across the border. Exiled Rwandese refugee sources said<BR>were against the agreement and claimed the UNHCR had been applying<BR>strong arm tactics to coerce the refugees to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile in what is seen as a diplomatic breakthrough, Zairean<BR>President Mobutu Sese Seko and the Ugandan leader Yoweri Museveni<BR>have agreed to work together &quot;to help prevent further humanitarian<BR>tragedies in Rwanda and Burundi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali, they met<BR>former American President Jimmy Carter here and the latter agreed<BR>to convene a peace conference with the active involvement of<BR>Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire to foster reconciliation and peace in<BR>the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carter said he expected to get the conference going very soon<BR>and the priority on the agenda would be &quot;how to prevent further<BR>tragedies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former American leader has been actively involved in the<BR>search for peace in much of sub-Saharan Africa with particular<BR>interest in the long-standing conflict in the Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa's first democratic local government<BR>elections had by November 5 delivered a resounding win to South<BR>African President Nelson M andela's ruling African National<BR>Congress (ANC) and a mortal blow to white separatists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela's ruling party had secured 69.1 per cent of votes cast<BR>in the November 1 election, with only about 20 per cent of results<BR>outstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is significantly higher than the 62.6 per cent the ANC<BR>polled in last year' s first all-race general election, although<BR>it must be considered that boundary and constitutional disputes<BR>resulted in no voting taking place in KwaZulu-Natal province, the<BR>stronghold of the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC dominated seven out of eight provinces where voting<BR>took place and even made inroads in Western Cape province,<BR>traditionally a stronghold of the formerly-ruling National Party<BR>(NP).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Western Cape results could also change as there was no<BR>voting in the Greater Cape Town area, a powerbase for the NP and<BR>the Liberal Democratic Party (DP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC will also control South Africa's largest city, winning<BR>outright majorities in the four councils and the overarching<BR>metropolitan council of Greater Johannesburg, despite strong<BR>showings by the NP and the DP, which regained the support of<BR>wealthy whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP of Deputy President Frederik de Klerk, although<BR>disappointed by its poor showing in the Western Cape, can take<BR>heart that its total share of the vote was 20.5 per cent, slightly<BR>higher than what it achieved in last year's first all-race general<BR>election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP is ecstatic about its strong support among white<BR>Afrikaners-- descendants of the original Dutch and French<BR>colonists who make up about 58 per cent of the white population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP triumphed in the capital Pretoria over both the ANC and<BR>the white right-wing parties, which suffered humiliating defeats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pro-apartheid Conservative Party (CP), contesting its first<BR>election under democracy, having boycotted the general election,<BR>was virtually wiped out in Pretoria, failing to win a single war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the same story for the more pragmatic, but still<BR>separatist Freedom Front (FF), which fared better than the CP but<BR>failed to attract large numbers of Afrikaners to its cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the rural heartland where the CP and FF want a &quot;volkstaat&quot;<BR>-- Afrikaner state -- both parties suffered heavily at the hands<BR>of the NP and the ANC, failing to win any towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NP leader and Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer<BR>summed up what may political analysts believe about the chances<BR>for a separate Afrikaner state: &quot;The volkstaat idea has been<BR>killed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decimation of the white right is certain to lead the ANCwhite homeland.<BR>dominated government of national unity to reject any claims for a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is tacitly acknowledged by FF leader Constand Viljeon, who<BR>said he would now send his few town councilors on a course to<BR>teach them - &quot;how to deal as Afrikaners with a situation where you<BR>are totally overpowered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The local elections also dealt blows to the militant black Pan<BR>Africanist Congre ss (PAC), which polled 1.7 per cent of the votes<BR>and failed to capitalise on ANC's failure to speedily deliver on<BR>its social upliftment promises to the black majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The racial divide was also shown by the arrest of former<BR>Defence Minister Magnus Malan and 10 former senior military<BR>officers on charges of murdering 13 people in KwaZulu-Natal<BR>province in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White politicians, including de Klerk, have said the arrests<BR>pose a serious threat to reconciliation in South Africa, while<BR>black leaders have stated that the trial must proceed and there<BR>must be full disclosure of crimes committed in defence of<BR>apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The row over the arrest of Malan and the others, who were<BR>released on bail after a brief court appearance on November 2, may<BR>have impacted on voting trends and analysts believe the arrests<BR>cut white support for the ANC.<BR>-0Rwanda and Zaire</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dar-es-Salaam - The Tanzanian Episcopal Conference (TEC) and<BR>the Christian Council of Tanzania (CCT) have called on all<BR>Tanzanians to conduct themselves peacefully and urged those who<BR>have complaints following the October 29 multi-party parliamentary<BR>and presidential polls to direct them to the National Electoral<BR>Commission or the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a joint statement here on November 2 the Catholics under TEC<BR>and Protestants under the CCT expressed hope that the Electoral<BR>Commission would accord due weight to these complaints and where<BR>courts are involved, justice will be swiftly accorded in the<BR>interests of peace, and tranquility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement signed by Archbishop P. Pengo, chairman of the<BR>Tanzanian Episcopal Conference and CCT chairman Bishop E. Sendoro<BR>of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT) also<BR>appealed to the government to take all the necessary precautions<BR>to ensure that peace is maintained and human rights are<BR>safeguarded. The church leaders further appealed to people of all<BR>beliefs in Tanzania to continue praying to Almighty God that peace<BR>which &quot;has been our bles sing from Him for all these past years<BR>may be maintained.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The churches' representatives expressed regret at the state of<BR>tension prevailing in Tanzania during what they termed as a<BR>&quot;difficult transition period&quot; which had been prompted by<BR>legitimate complaints concerning several management and<BR>supervisory mistakes which cropped up in the running of the justMeanwhile, Tanzania's ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCMRevolution Party) outgoing President Ali Hassan Mwinyi, has urged<BR>concluded General Elections.<BR>the opposition to accept the results of the country's first multiMwinyi, leaving office after 10 years as president made his<BR>party polls for the sake of the maintenance of peace.<BR>appeal on November 7, on state radio at the same time as High<BR>Court judges listened to submissions by 10 opposition parties who<BR>want the parliamentary and presidential elections declared null<BR>and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition is supported by the Tanzanian Election<BR>Monitoring Committee (TEMCO) which declared the country's first<BR>multi-party polls as neither free nor fair, an opinion that was<BR>also echoed by the Commonwealth observers group which said the<BR>confusion and chaos that prevailed in the Tanzanian election had<BR>not been experienced in other Commonwealth countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presidential polls were being contested by CCM's Benjamin<BR>Mkapa, Augustine Mrema of the National Convention for Construction<BR>and Reform (NCCR-Mageuzi), Ibrahim Lipumba of the Civic United<BR>Front (CUF) and John Cheyo of the United Democratic Front (UDF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elsewhere in Zanzibar, the main opposition, the Civic United<BR>Front (CUF) on November 7 boycotted the opening ceremony of the<BR>new multi-party parliament.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London/Nairobi - Christian Solidarity International (CSI), a<BR>British non- governmental organisation says slave trade continues<BR>at a brisk pace in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blacks from the South are forcefully seized by Arab raiders<BR>from the north and are despatched as menial and hard labour<BR>workers in Arab households and farmholdings in the north of the<BR>country. Young men and women are often targeted in these raids.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Christian Solidarity International has on a number of occasions<BR>been forced to buy back slaves after their families pleaded with<BR>the organisation for assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government of Sudan regularly denies the existence of<BR>slaves in the country but Christian Solidarity recorded a<BR>transaction involving a trader who bought back 22 slaves for 1<BR>million Sudanese pounds(about US dollars 1,818). CSI provided some<BR>of the money and the event was broadcast on the British<BR>Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) programme Focus on Faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Focus on Faith reported that a recent raid by Arabs resulted<BR>in the death of two children whose hut was set on fire as they<BR>slept in the village of Nyam Lel in western Barh el Ghaz al. Abuki<BR>Matiar, a blind Dinka woman who survived the raid said on the<BR>night of the attack, panic broke out in the village and she could<BR>here people crying in the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The raiders spoke Arabic. I tried to run but stumbled over a<BR>stool,&quot; the blind Abaki said in a translated version. Nearly 300<BR>women and children were seized that night and transported for sale<BR>in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A village administrator of the Sudan People's Liberation Army<BR>(SPLA) named Chok said in the programme: &quot;These raids are<BR>organised by the government of Sudan. They tell their people - you<BR>go and get these people since they are weak now,&quot; an allusion to a<BR>string of victories by the government army in the south of the<BR>country in the last three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic Bishop of El Obeid, Bishop Macram Marx Gassis who<BR>is in London told Focus on Faith: &quot;Sudan is the country of<BR>slavery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bishop who did not mince his words said the rulers in<BR>Khartoum were always denying the fact. &quot;But in their Holy War or<BR>Jihad they consider it their right to do what they are doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both the Sudanese embassies in London and Nairobi deny the<BR>claim about the slave trade in Sudan, saying the accusation is not<BR>new and had been found to have little merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the Bishop of Rumbek Diocese, Caesar Mazzolari told<BR>APS that it was good that a lot of evidence is coming out now<BR>because the Sudanese government routinely denies such accusations.<BR>&quot;Now that we have the evidence, the whole world will be able to<BR>help,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked if he subscribed to the practice of buying back the<BR>slaves, Bishop Mazzolari said it was good in the circumstances<BR>because &quot;it restores people back to their families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nyam Lel where 300 women were seized in a recent attack is in<BR>Bishop Mazzolari's diocese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the army in Uganda's capital, Kampala, has confirmed<BR>the rescue of some 100 children by the SPLA. The children were<BR>expected to be handed over to Uganda Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF)<BR>in Kitgumtown on November 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources in Uganda say the children, reportedly aged between 6<BR>and 18 years were held in Sudan by rebels of the Lord's Resistance<BR>Army (LRA) of Joseph Kony in exchange for guns. Government<BR>officials say another 300 children believed to be in slavery in<BR>Sudan may not easily return home.<BR>-0Tanzania</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - African leaders have paid glowing tribute to the<BR>slain Israeli leader, Yitzhak Rabin, assassinated by a Jewish<BR>fanatic as he left a peace rally in Tel Aviv on November 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A lone gunman, Yigal Amir, a 27 year old one-time paratrooper<BR>in the Israeli Army, who was studying law at an Israeli seminary,<BR>shot Rabin at close range on the night of November 4 . He said he<BR>acted &quot;on God's orders.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak whose own predecessor, President<BR>Anwar Sadat, was mowed down in 1981 by Egyptian fanatics opposed<BR>to the peace deal with Israel, declared at Rabin's funeral on<BR>November 6; &quot;We must continue the long journey; peace is the only<BR>way.&quot; Mubarak who was visiting Israel for the first time said he<BR>had a duty to attend the funeral of a great peace maker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said the death of Rabin &quot;was<BR>not only a loss to Israel but to all those who were committed to<BR>peace in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African President Nelson Mandela, lamented that like<BR>another great peace maker of our time, Mahatma Gandhi of India who<BR>was gunned down by a Hindu fanatic nearly 50 years a go, Rabin had<BR>been killed by his own people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela, himself a great peace maker who has been able to bring<BR>blacks and whites together in post-apartheid South Africa, has<BR>been warned by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, that he could be the next<BR>target of assassins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And following Archbishop Tutu's warning that right wing<BR>fanatics could kill &quot;Mad iba&quot;, as Mandela is fondly known at home,<BR>the South African police have announced that they have redoubled<BR>security around Mandela and all the top leaders in the South<BR>African government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police would now be on full alert to protect Mandela whose own<BR>relaxed personal lifestyle will now be severely curtailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African Police Chief George Fivaz said there was great<BR>similarity between the Israeli-Palestinian and the South African<BR>peace process. He could not afford to take chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We must learn from the Rabin assassination,&quot; he told the<BR>Sowetan newspaper, here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile in Israel, millions wept openly as the late Israeli<BR>leader was laid to rest at the Mount Herzl National Cemetery in<BR>Jerusalem on November 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The death of the man who declared that Arabs and Jews had had<BR>enough of the bloodshed between neighbours, has brought out into<BR>the open the festering differences between the secular and<BR>orthodox Jews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Orthodox Jews considered Rabin a traitor while some secular<BR>Jews said right wing Jewish settlers on Palestinian lands should<BR>not just be evacuated but shot by the Israeli Army instead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was said by the church's charismatic leader, Ray MacCauley<BR>in Durban recent ly. He said that his church, which enjoys the<BR>support of thousands of people in the country will mobilise South<BR>Africans to press the government to take drastic steps to curb<BR>crime and violence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;We need to get a message to the government that<BR>people have had enough of crime and they feel frustrated. The<BR>government has got to admit that crime is out of control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev MacCauley's concern was echoed by police spokesman in the<BR>province, Col. Bal a Naido who said that 123 people were killed in<BR>the week ending November 5 alone, representing a big jump from the<BR>79 people reported killed the week before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to police statistics, an alarming 1,200 murders,<BR>1,000 rapes and attempted rapes and 7,000 housebreakings had been<BR>reported in the city of Durban this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Rev MacCauley's effort has been augmented by<BR>concerned citizens who are mobilising to call for the<BR>reintroduction of the death penalty which was repealed this year<BR>in June by the government of Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church leader said that the country needs something drastic<BR>to be done. &quot;We are trying to get the whole country...20 to 30<BR>million people to come together to channel frustrations and convey<BR>their message to the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that the government did not admit crime was soaring<BR>because this could jeopardise its image abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the church would launch the &quot;Stop Crime&quot; campaign soon.<BR>This would be followed by gatherings of South Africans at nine<BR>provincial government offices on November 29 to submit plans to<BR>combat crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Short-to-medium term plans include better pay, training and<BR>equipment for the police and stepped up police and army patrols.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bujumbura - At least 300 people have died, 42 of them in a<BR>single incident, after new ethnic violence erupted in racially<BR>divided Burundi early November, humanitarian sources and radio<BR>reports said on November 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State Radio Burundi said 42 people, including a soldier, were<BR>killed on November 1 in an attack by unknown assailants on a camp<BR>of displaced Tutsi people in Muruta in northern Kayanza province,<BR>which borders Ngozi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dozens more were also reported killed across the country in the<BR>previous 24 hours, a humanitarian agency source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the capital Bujumbura, five people were killed and about 10<BR>wounded in unexplained automatic weapon fire and grenade<BR>explosions overnight on November 1, the national radio said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The humanitarian source, which sought anonymity said that 147<BR>people had been killed and 26 injured during an operation a week<BR>earlier by the Tutsi-dominated army in the town of Tangara, in<BR>Ngozi province, and dozens more died in ensuing clashes in the<BR>region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National radio disputed the figure and quoted security sources<BR>saying only 50 people died in the incident in Ngozi province.<BR>However, other estimates put the death toll as high as 250.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Paris, visiting Burundian President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya<BR>blamed the killi ng in Tangara on 'complicity&quot; between &quot;certain<BR>elements of the army and the displaced,&quot; a reference to Burundian<BR>Tutsis displaced from their homes by inter-ethnic clashes that<BR>have torn the central African nation in the last two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ntibantunganya said the death toll from the clashes in Ngozi<BR>province stood at between &quot;50 and 250,&quot; but an enquiry was needed<BR>to verify the final toll. Military investigators were to visit the<BR>region on November 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What happened is part of a cycle of violence in the country<BR>over the last two years. It seems that it is part of reprisal<BR>operations that may be the result of an inter-ethnic malaise ,&quot;<BR>Ntibantunganya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still in Paris, President Ntibantunganya appealed to the United<BR>Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)<BR>to help stop broadcasts by a &quot;pirate radio station&quot; which the<BR>Burundian President said are inciting his country's people to<BR>violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing UNESCO's 28th General Conference on October 31,<BR>President Ntibantunganya said the station called Radio Democracy<BR>was promoting murderous hatred in Burundi which has been torn by<BR>ethnic strife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Burundian leader told the UNESCO General Conference meeting<BR>at its headquarters in the French capital from October 21 to<BR>November 17 that he remained confident in the future of his<BR>country and reaffirmed his commitment to a culture of development<BR>and to UNESCO's &quot;concept of tolerance, conceived not as charity of<BR>the powerful toward the weak, but as mutual recognition of<BR>different values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On his part the UNESCO Director-General Mr. Federico Mayor<BR>deplored the ethnic conflicts in Burundi and challenged the<BR>international community &quot;to rise with all possible means and<BR>resources&quot; to the challenge of democratic transition in that<BR>country. He also promised that UNESCO would pledge US dollars<BR>50,000 to help this impoverished central African country locate<BR>the source of the pirate radio broadcasts and try to jam them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The central African nation of six million people has been torn<BR>by bloody ethnic conflict between the Hutus, who constitute 80 per<BR>cent of the population, and the Tutsi who, despite their small<BR>numbers, traditionally dominate the government and army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the armed gangs that clash with the army claim to be<BR>part of a military group linked to the Council for the Defence of<BR>Democracy set up last year by former Interior Minister Leonard<BR>Nyangoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group is allegedly linked to the October 1993 abortive coup<BR>in which President Melchior Ndadaye, the country's first<BR>democratically elected president from the Hutu majority, was<BR>killed.<BR>-0South Africa</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Donor countries have pledged US dollars 145.7<BR>million to support the Liberian peace process. The amount is 4.3<BR>million dollars short of the total requested by West African<BR>leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the United States alone pledged 75 million dollars - half<BR>of the US 150 dollars requested by leaders of the Economic<BR>Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for disarmament and<BR>demobilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The administration of President Bill Clinton made the<BR>commitment here recently at a donors' conference for Liberia,<BR>organised by the United Nations and African leaders to coincide<BR>with the United Nations 50th Anniversary celebrations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain, France and other European Union countries also pledged<BR>support for the peace process. The UN made it clear that Liberia<BR>was in worse shape than Rwanda. &quot;I would compare the severity of<BR>the humanitarian crisis in West Africa with both Rwanda and the<BR>former Yugoslavia,&quot; UN Under Secretary-General for humanitarian<BR>affairs, Peter Hansen, told the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN on October 4, appealed for relief aid for Liberia,<BR>totalling US dollars 110 million and US dollars 14 million for<BR>Sierra Leone. ECOWAS leaders, led by its Chairman President Jerry<BR>Rawlings of Ghana, want US dollars 150 million for disarmament,<BR>encampment and demobilisation of more than 60,000 Liberian militia<BR>fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chairman of Liberia's Council of State, Wilton Sankawulo,<BR>has put forward a reconstruction programme of about US dollars 300<BR>million. Meanwhile, back in Liberia, the UN suspended relief<BR>operations in the central part of the country due to harassment of<BR>aid workers by members of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic<BR>Front of Liberia (NPFL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fighters are reportedly becoming increasingly lawless and<BR>out of control, and in one recent incident at Taylor's<BR>headquarters at Gbarnga, they are said to have looted a UN<BR>warehouse containing food for 500 orphans. Although the August 26<BR>ceasefire is generally holding, there have been reports of<BR>skirmishes between different factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent clashes, Taylor said Gbarnga was attacked by fighters<BR>loyal to Alhaji Kromah's United Liberation Movement of Liberia<BR>(ULIMO) factions and a week of fighting ensued before they were<BR>repulsed, but Kromah denied the allegations. However, a British<BR>Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reporter, who toured the area, was<BR>shown several identity cards and headless bodies of ULIMO<BR>fighters. He quoted NPFL commanders as saying, retreating ULIMO<BR>fighters severed the heads of their colleagues to conceal their<BR>identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, reports from Monrovia say Taylor and Kromah met last<BR>week to iron out differences following a scuffle between their<BR>bodyguards at Monrovia's Executive Mansion (State House). They<BR>also ordered their men to halt fighting at the contentious St Paul<BR>River Bridge, separating Bong and Lofa counties in Central<BR>Liberia. Both men are vice chairmen on the State Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taylor has called for the swift deployment in the area of the<BR>ECOMOG West Africa n intervention force. Relief workers say they<BR>will return to central Liberia only after the deployment of ECOMOG<BR>troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a separate development, a member of a team of journalists<BR>who visited the town of Tapeta in the NPFL stronghold of Nimba<BR>County, has confirmed that 75 people died in a massacre that<BR>occurred there on September 27. The local reporter said most of<BR>the town's inhabitants have fled into surrounding villages<BR>following the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The incident occurred on a market day -- when the town is<BR>normally crowded - following an argument between NPFL fighters and<BR>some residents, which resulted in the fighters opening fire<BR>indiscriminately. Most of the town's now teeming population is<BR>made up of refugees from regions considered to be hostile to the<BR>NPFL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Politicians from the area have called for the rapid deployment<BR>of ECOMOG troops to stamp out lawlessness. At the same time,<BR>Taylor's deputy, Major-General Enoch Dogolea, has apologised for<BR>the killings and said those responsible have been arrested and<BR>will face a court martial. &quot;Anyone found guilty will be executed<BR>immediately. This nonsense must be stopped,&quot; he told reporters. It<BR>is not clear whether the State Council will sanction such<BR>unilateral action by the NPFL.<BR>-0Burundi</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Durban - In a bid to hasten the process of unification in the<BR>racially divided Dutch Reformed Church (DRC) in South Africa, the<BR>mainly white DRC was expected to meet its sister churches on<BR>November 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to press reports, the slow rate of progress in<BR>uniting the church has seen this major grouping lag behind other<BR>church groups which have recently tied their racial knot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two years ago the &quot;coloured&quot; (mixed race) and African (black)<BR>branches of the church merged to form the Uniting Reformed Church<BR>of Southern Africa, but several pockets of the church have<BR>resisted the move, with many stating that they want to join the<BR>white church.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reports say that within the white church itself, there is<BR>resistance to some of the aspects of unity, including that some<BR>white members would not like to be part of a non-racial, united<BR>church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In terms of synod decisions in the Dutch Reformed Church, a<BR>regional synod has been held in all of the church's 11 regions.<BR>Among the issues discussed was the question of unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Rev Willie Botha, who is responsible for<BR>coordinating the unity discussion in his church, members are<BR>largely in favour of unity but express problems with one of the<BR>more important issues in the whole discussion: the Belhar<BR>Confession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Belhar Confession was adopted by the Coloured Dutch<BR>Reformed Mission Church during the height of apartheid. It express<BR>the pain suffered during the time and encapsulates the deep-seated<BR>religious revulsion felt for the system of oppression inflicted by<BR>the system of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Uniting Church has declared that unless this confession is<BR>adopted as a full confession by a new church which will<BR>incorporate the DRC, the talks will come to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The press reports say it remains a stumbling block, with almost<BR>all of the 11 synods within the white church stating their<BR>opposition to it being incorporated into a new church order as a<BR>full confession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, say the reports, some members are prepared to<BR>see it as a &quot;statement&quot; adopted by the church, while others are<BR>bitterly opposed to its incorporation anywhere in the new church<BR>order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting was also likely to discuss church property and<BR>finances. This includes the question of pensions in a situation in<BR>which racially differentiated churches mean white clergy receive<BR>more money than black clergy.<BR>-0Liberia</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>November 13, 1995 (19951113)<BR>by Kidji Nduku</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - As the campaign against the spread of AIDS continues<BR>in Uganda, custodians of morality are concerned about<BR>advertisements promoting the choice of condoms as a means of<BR>protection against the human immuno deficiency virus (HIV). The<BR>head of the Catholic Church in this East African country is not<BR>amused by such adverts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The head of the Catholic Church in Uganda Archbishop Emmanuel<BR>Wamala is an angry man. He is incensed by commercials carried by<BR>the media and the Ministry of Health roadside and strategicallypick from in order to be protected against the Acquired Immune<BR>placed billboards, advertising condoms as one of the options to<BR>Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his anger, Cardinal Wamala has harshly criticised health<BR>officials and the business community for promoting and 'peddling';<BR>condoms as an effective means of preventing the rampaging AIDS<BR>scourge in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the Ministry of Health billboards give two other options,<BR>faithfulness and abstinence, a private firm advertises condoms of<BR>a brand name 'Protector' as the &quot;surest way for a modern person to<BR>beat AIDS&quot;. The commercials have rekindled a debate on condoms as<BR>a means to fight the spread of AIDS and morality in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AIDS was first identified in the country in 1982 in Rakai<BR>District, western Uganda. Today, about 10 per cent of the 17<BR>million Ugandans are said to be infected with the human immunoAccording to the HIV/AIDS surveillance report of the Uganda<BR>deficiency virus (HIV) which causes AIDS.<BR>AIDS Commission, released in March 1995, by December 1994, there<BR>were 46,120 AIDS cases, out of whom 42,437 representing 92 per<BR>cent, were adults above 12 years of age. Out of that number, there<BR>were 19,638 males (47.3 per cent), while 21,921 were female (51.7<BR>per cent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The multi-sectoral AIDS control approach on population based<BR>studies, indicate that women have shown a much higher rate of HIV<BR>infection than men, AIDS affects women in a special way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to fight the spread of AIDS, the government tacitly<BR>approved the widespread use of condoms and back in 1991, the<BR>government-owned daily, New Vision, ran several advertisements of<BR>condoms. However, the Church, particularly the Catholic Church<BR>protested to President Yoweri Museveni and the advertisers<BR>withdrew their campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it is believed in some circles that a staunch<BR>supporter of Museveni, Rev. Misareri Kavuma, the retired Bishop of<BR>Church of Uganda Namirembe Cathedral in Kampala, did not take up<BR>the chairmanship of Uganda AIDS Commission due to the condoms<BR>issue. He was appointed about two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This time round, apart from New Vision, the two private radio<BR>stations FM capital and Sanyu' State-owned Radio Uganda and Uganda<BR>Television are carrying commercials talking boldly about condoms.<BR>One commercial even portrays the HIV virus inside a condom with<BR>the user about to throw it away in a latrine, lamenting how it is<BR>going to die instead of being hosted by a human being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is this particular commercial which many have found<BR>tasteless, in fact disgusting. In a letter to the Editor of New<BR>Vision, Peter Oporia narrates a story of his young son who after<BR>hearing the commercial on the radio asked what condo/kondo (thief)<BR>was and was slapped by an elder sister. &quot;Condoms cause problems<BR>and promote immorality,&quot; Oporia sums up the condoms issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Kizito a secondary school student and a committed<BR>Christian asks how a parent can give a child a condom as a weapon<BR>against AIDS, as it is being suggested especially by government<BR>officials and advertisers of condoms. He instead suggests the<BR>teaching of morals as condoms are not foolproof. &quot;We young people<BR>should shun what some leaders and parents are telling us as far as<BR>using condoms is concerned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kizito is silent on sex education in schools which the<BR>government had started but was opposed mainly by the Catholic<BR>Church. Despite the positive press reviews of the programme, there<BR>is still a debate on sex education. Initially, parents accepted it<BR>when people feared the AIDS epidemic but not any more, as they do<BR>not see why their children should be introduced to maturity by<BR>teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cardinal Wamala, being a Catholic does not advocate the usage<BR>of condoms but the change of sexual attitude among the people of<BR>Uganda. Ugandans should not be deceived that the use of condoms<BR>would save their lives when they continue to engage in immoral<BR>sexual habits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He laments that although the country had acquired a favourable<BR>image abroad on the political front, it had an ugly image as far<BR>as the AIDS scourge is concerned. &quot;This is alarming.  When you go<BR>abroad people no longer refer to Uganda as the country of dictator<BR>Idi Amin (former president) but as a country which is suffering a<BR>lot under the AIDS killer disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says he will never give up his call for strong family values<BR>and the appeal to people to turn to God as their saviour from such<BR>irresponsible sexual behaviour. Like Kizito, the Archbishop does<BR>not address the problem of the youth and sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Kampala private practitioner Dr. John Worst Kimbowa concedes<BR>that condoms are being used as the main weapon against HIV, a<BR>virus which causes AIDS, together with health education and clean<BR>syringes. &quot;Indeed with such a three-pronged thrust, health workers<BR>in the United States of America too have managed to bring down the<BR>incidence among homosexuals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, health workers everywhere have gone out to utilise those<BR>means especially cndoms. In Uganda, says Dr. Kimbowa, the players<BR>are mainly the Uganda AIDS Commission, individual organisations,<BR>many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and businessmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says that all these advertise, but &quot;Protector&quot; is purely a<BR>business venture. &quot;Somebody brought it and distributed to all<BR>shops. But individual programmes also bring in condoms and<BR>distribute them free of charge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Kimbowa views the condom as a harmless gadget without any<BR>medical side effects &quot;but, there is a catch, the user has to be<BR>well motivated to use it and must have some basic idea of micro<BR>biology to understand how it works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He notes that those who claim to use condoms have failed to<BR>apply this contraceptive method continuously,saying this is lack<BR>of knowledge. He does not object to the advertisements but says<BR>the content should be more explicit or else one gets poor results.<BR>In retrospect he says, nowhere in the world where condoms have<BR>been used to fight the spread of AIDS, &quot;have we seen the incidence<BR>going down except in the homosexual community referred to<BR>earlier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But since condoms are available and there is no alternative at<BR>the moment, &quot;let us use them.&quot; He however believes that the most<BR>effective preventive measure and yet cost free is the fear of<BR>death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says that fear has had a tremendous impact and adds, &quot;we no<BR>longer see gonorrhoea even among students as we did before, lodges<BR>are empty. These days I see 20 people a day without any case of<BR>gonorrhoea but before on Mondays, a doctor would see about 10. The<BR>trend today is one wife and a steady girlfriend, and women don't<BR>venture out like men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Kimbowa believes that Uganda has gone through the worst<BR>times as far as the AIDS pandemic is concerned. He says this East<BR>African country is on a plateau of AIDS and laments the continued<BR>loss of the working age group which he says could lead to a<BR>shortage of workers. &quot;But on the other hand, there is unemployment<BR>and therefore that cancels out,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Kimbowa decries the increase in dependency due to the high<BR>number of orphans in the country. &quot;This has led to more<BR>implications, that is why we have an increasing number of street<BR>children,&quot; he argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Josephine Kalule of Organisation AIDS Information Centre<BR>does not share Dr. Kimbowa's optimism. She says fear of death is<BR>no deterrent. &quot;We see more and more young people who are HIV<BR>positive,&quot; she notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The centre, a non-governmental organisation started in 1990<BR>provides free, voluntary and anonymous HIV test (the open market<BR>fee is an equivalent of US $6, prohibitive to the ordinary<BR>Ugandan), health education, counselling and creates public<BR>awareness. It further provides ongoing support to clients in order<BR>to help their psychological and social adjustment and to promote<BR>behavioural change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kalule is bailed out by the Uganda AIDS Commission whose report<BR>stresses &quot;the figures are not accurate and do not represent a<BR>complete picture of HIV(AIDS in Uganda. Epidemiologist in the<BR>country believe the number of cases reported represent as little<BR>as 15 to 20 per cent of the actual number of cases in the<BR>country.&quot;<BR>-0South Africa</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The peace process in Angola that was ushered in by<BR>the Lusaka accord of November 1994 remains fraught with many<BR>problems. A Canadian Church/Peace organisation report says if the<BR>will to reconcile is there, much of the tragedy that is synonymous<BR>with this southern African country following 19 years of civil<BR>war, would be a thing of the past)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last September 25, the two leaders in Angola's long running<BR>civil war happily sat side by side at the donors meeting in<BR>Brussels, Belgium and made a firm promise to the world - that they<BR>would fully support the one-year old peace process in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the Union for the Total<BR>Independence of Angola (UNI TA), promised that he would never<BR>again resort to the use of arms to solve the problems of Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Eduardo Dos Santos of the ruling Popular Movement for<BR>the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) said rehabilitation of Angola's<BR>war-devastated economy and infrastructure should be a priority for<BR>the peace settlement reached in Lusaka, Zambia, in November 1994,<BR>between the government and Savimbi's UNITA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unsure that donors would be well disposed towards Angola, where<BR>war flared afresh after the general elections of September 1992,<BR>Dos Santos called for money to be channelled into reconstruction<BR>projects, not handed over in cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the donors meeting, the United Nations Development<BR>Programme, (UNDP) presented a US $700 million programme for<BR>rehabilitation and development. At the end of the meet ing on<BR>September 26, the donor community pledged to give Angola US $800<BR>million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, despite an immense amount of international goodwill<BR>and the fact that the Angolan people &quot;are very tired of war,<BR>suffering and restrictions&quot; a lot will need to happen on the<BR>ground in Angola if this country is to achieve a lasting solution<BR>to her peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the message of a delegation from the Inter Church<BR>Coalition in Africa (ICCA), an affiliate of the Canadian Council<BR>of Churches who recently visited Angola on a fact finding mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their report focuses on the city of Malanje a potential flash<BR>point area in northern Angola, 80 per cent of which is controlled<BR>by UNITA. The team also visited Bailundo in South Western Angola.<BR>The report of their findings is written by John Kirkwood, a human<BR>rights volunteer with ICCA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While the ceasefire has largely held since the November (1994)<BR>signing of the Lusaka Accord, one gets the feeling that this could<BR>be broken at any time, and that a spark here or there might set<BR>off a larger conflagration,&quot; asserts Kirkwood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The observation that the peace process in Angola remains<BR>fragile, is underscored by the seizure last month by UNITA rebels,<BR>of a group of South Africans working at a mining project in the<BR>north of the country. UNITA alleges that the men are mercenaries<BR>working with the South African Executive Outcomes Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kirkwood raises concern about the leadership of the Armed<BR>Forces of Angola (FAA) , the government army who perceived<BR>themselves to be winning the war by November 1994, and have<BR>massively rearmed since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the countryside around Malanje is UNITA territory. The<BR>two sides have drawn back from battle lines and now face each<BR>other across a 10-20 kilometre strip of &quot;no man's land.&quot; Free<BR>passage here is very risky but the non-governmental organisations<BR>(NGOs) and the United Nations are the only ones doing this<BR>(crossing the strip).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In Malanje, very few NGOs are set up in UNITA territory,<BR>fearing a repeat of the confiscation of vehicles and supplies in<BR>the event of another outbreak of hostilities as happened after the<BR>elections in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lusaka Accord demands that all UNITA troops be disarmed and<BR>housed in quartering camps until they are either demobilised or<BR>recruited into the new national army. It also requires government<BR>troops to be confined to barracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By mid-September, around Malanje and Bailundo in the southwest<BR>of the country, reports Kirkwood, &quot;neither side had wanted to be<BR>first to observe this stipulation of the accord though more<BR>pressure seems to be on UNITA , and they are making signs of<BR>movement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And while they begin to cooperate, UNITA are also demanding<BR>that the Special Mobile Police be disarmed as well. &quot;Most UNITA<BR>civilian supporters were killed by the Mobile Police in late<BR>November 1992 and into 1993 in many government held cities<BR>following UNITA's overrunning of large chunks of territory after<BR>they lost the last elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kirkwood says the United Nations peacekeeping mission to<BR>Angola, UNAVEM, seems determined to do things correctly this time<BR>round in order to avoid the tragic events of three years ago.<BR>&quot;There is determination by the United Nations that demobilisation<BR>will be more completely done before the next steps are taken - the<BR>formation of the national army and government of national unity.<BR>The Canadian international peace worker believes the 7,000 UNAVEM<BR>troops now being assembled will have a better chance to accomplish<BR>the task ahead than did the meagre 400 blue helmets in 1992 .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Right now, with the coming of the rains in October/November the<BR>urgent need is for tools and seeds to plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lutheran World Federation (LWF) Christian Action in Angola<BR>and other aid agencies continue to make aid available, mainly<BR>through Christian congregations as the instruments of assistance<BR>to the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roofing sheets are very urgently needed for rebuilding houses<BR>now that the rain season is at hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Distribution of aid in UNITA areas is fraught with more<BR>problems. &quot;Yet it is in UNITA areas that people need to receive at<BR>least some initial fruits of peace and thus develop some minimal<BR>confidence in the peace process,&quot; observes the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kirkwood reports further that many displaced people in or near<BR>Malanje city would like to return to their villages but most are<BR>situated within UNITA control. A woman said some women were<BR>attacked when they went towards the UNITA &quot;border&quot; in search of<BR>cassava.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kirkwood is convinced that Angola will enjoy peace only if<BR>there is the political will to reconcile and share power at top<BR>levels in the two rival parties because the common people are<BR>&quot;very tired of war and its implication. Otherwise the stand-off<BR>between the two warring parties will continue because of the<BR>atrocities that were committed on both sides.<BR>-0Uganda</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>November 13, 1995 (19951113)<BR>by Nernlor Gruduah</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Nigeria is one of the countries featured prominently<BR>at the Commonwealth Heads of State and Government Summit which<BR>opened on November 9 in Auckland, Newzealand. Opposition parties<BR>from former coloniser Britain, have called for sanctions against<BR>this West African country whose military rule and entire<BR>democratic process have come under heavy criticism from the<BR>international community. The October 30 death sentence passed on<BR>54 year-old leader of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni<BR>People (MOSOP) Ken Saro-Wiwa, only complicates the case for<BR>Africa's most populous nation.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It appears there is no shortage of military tricksters in<BR>Nigeria. Considering it is now 35 years since the country gained<BR>independence from Britain, perhaps more than 70 per cent of its<BR>population of over 100 million have been born and bred under<BR>military dictatorship.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their contact with democracy has only been a glimpse, not more.<BR>There have actually been two short-lived civilian administrations<BR>in Nigeria's entire history. The First Republic following<BR>independence ruled from 1960 to 1966, when the then federal Prime<BR>Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, was assassinated, together<BR>with several government officials in a military coup. The Second<BR>Republic (1979- 83), led by Alhaji Shehu Shagari, was ended when<BR>Maj. Gen. Muhammed Buhari seized power in a bloodless coup in<BR>December 31, 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the most part, democracy has remained largely a dream in<BR>the continent's most populous state, and some have come to the<BR>conclusion that Nigeria is synonymous with militarism in Africa.<BR>Most theatrical amongst the military tacticians in recent Nigerian<BR>history have been Generals Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Babangida earned the nickname, &quot;Maradona&quot; for his ability to<BR>manoeuvre in playing on the psychology of Nigerians and the former<BR>strongman led the international community by the nose from 1985 to<BR>1993 until he reached the end of his thither.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he deposed Bahari (also in a peaceful coup) in August<BR>1985, Babangida promised a seven-year transitional period and a<BR>return to democratic rule in October 1992. Among the conditions<BR>set by the Babangida regime for a return to civilian rule was the<BR>disqualification of all politicians who participated in previous<BR>administrations from standing in the proposed elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military also struck off all existing political parties and<BR>created two new parties, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the<BR>National Republican Convention (NRC), which immediately absorbed<BR>the familiar North-South political divide. Although leaders of<BR>both parties had sort of transposed positions to conceal this<BR>division, the obvious was the case. While the SDP received most<BR>support from the south, NRC was boosted by northerners. Meanwhile,<BR>the ban on former politicians was later lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as the October deadline approached, uncertainty set in as<BR>Babangida postponed the hand-over date to January 2, 1993, arguing<BR>that electoral malpractices and disputes resulting from state<BR>elections needed to be sorted out before presidential elections<BR>could be held. A combination of other delaying tactics was<BR>introduced, including legislation empowering the National<BR>Electoral Commission (NEC) to disqualify any candidate considered<BR>to be unfit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process dragged on until June 12, 1993, when the<BR>presidential elections were finally held, pitting SDP candidate<BR>Bashorun Moshood K.O. Abiola, a southerner, against NRC candidate,<BR>Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa, from the north. Independent observers<BR>described the polls as the most democratic in Nigeria's history.<BR>Midway through counting, Abiola was said to be well in the lead<BR>and headed for a landslide. But, alas, Nigerians were in for a<BR>typical comedy: the military cancelled the results, claiming there<BR>were irregularities, plunging the country deeper into yet more<BR>political turmoil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tensions, coupled with international pressure, boiled to the<BR>brink, forcing Babangida to cede power to an &quot;interim government&quot;<BR>led by Chief Ernest Shonekan, who also refused to announce the<BR>results of the elections. He was seen by critics as Babangida's<BR>face in disguise. Life was not any better for Shonekan, as Nigeria<BR>was rocked by a series of riots and strikes in support of Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the midst of the chaos, another surprise package emerged.<BR>Babangida's former Defence Minister, General Sani Abacha, wrested<BR>power from Shonekan in November 1993, to &quot;save Nigeria from<BR>further disaster.&quot; A man considered to be behind a handful of<BR>previous military coups, Abacha also defied Nigerians and the<BR>international community by refusing to validate the June 12 el<BR>ection results, but instead set up a &quot;national conference&quot; to draw<BR>up a new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He soon began a crackdown on opposition and the media to<BR>consolidate his hold on power. Venting his frustration at the<BR>continued military intransigence, Chief Abiola declared himself<BR>President to mark the anniversary of the annulled elections - some<BR>say he took the matter into his own hands. He was subsequently<BR>arrested and charged with treason. The trial was on, off and is<BR>still off. The United States and the European Union responded with<BR>limited sanctions, calling on Abacha to step down and restore<BR>democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Going by recent developments, it seems Abacha is the craftiest<BR>of military dictators Nigeria has ever produced. He displayed a<BR>melodramatic subtlety that threw the international community into<BR>a chasm. When he realised pressure from within and outside over<BR>the unconditional release of Abiola had reached its peak, Abacha<BR>announced the foiling of what, analysts say, appeared to be a well<BR>thoughtout, concocted coup plot against his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The coup attempt allegedly uncovered in March involved 40<BR>military officers and civilians, including outspoken former<BR>military Head of State, retired General Olusegun Obasanjo. Thus<BR>Abacha effectively diverted the focus of attention and put a gag<BR>in the clamor for Abiola's release. Not only is Obasanjo the only<BR>former military ruler to have handed power peacefully to a<BR>civilian administration, but he has been at the forefront of the<BR>current campaign against prolonged military rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's 26-member Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) tried the<BR>alleged coup plotters in secret, convicted and presumably<BR>sentenced them to death by firing squad, provoking international<BR>outrage. The Head of State used the men as a bargaining chip amid<BR>widespread criticism of total disregard for international norms<BR>and the rule of law. The regime promised to pardon the convicts in<BR>return for Britain assistance on debt, diplomacy and transition to<BR>civilian rule. But a team that investigated human right abuses in<BR>the country in July called on Britain and other Commonwealth<BR>countries to apply comprehensive sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;By almost every human rights criterion, Nigerians are excluded<BR>from the guarantees which any Commonwealth citizen expects,&quot; says<BR>the group. Commonwealth countries were urged to stop all but<BR>humanitarian aid to Nigeria, including military cooperation and<BR>deny visas to Nigerian officials. And the November Commonwealth<BR>summit in Auckland, New Zealand, has been asked to press Nigeria<BR>to release all political prisoners or face sanctions, including an<BR>embargo on vital oil exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of the barrage of strong rebuke, Abacha looks unmoved<BR>as demonstrated in his independence day address on October 1.<BR>Going back on his earlier promise to hand over power by 1996, he<BR>said the military would rule until 1998, but quickly diluted the<BR>anger provoked by the announcement by commuting the death<BR>sentences of 40 convicted coup plotters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Originally sentences on the 40 were never made public, but<BR>Obasanjo was believed to have been jailed for life while his<BR>former deputy Shehu Musa Yar'Adua and others received death<BR>sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its latest pronouncement, the military government sentenced<BR>Obasanjo to 15 years, while Yar'Adua got 25 years. The planned<BR>return to civilian rule did not go down well with Nigeria's Nobel<BR>Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, who cast doubt on the programme<BR>and dismissed Abacha as &quot;a congenital liar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main opposition group, NADECO, was downright in its<BR>rejection of the turn-over date: &quot;The National Democratic<BR>Coalition (NADECO) rejects in its entirety the purported<BR>transition programme deceptively slated to last for three years<BR>but in reality of indefinite duration .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Michael Ajasin, Chairman of NADECO, in a statement: &quot;The<BR>programme contains several provisions designed to make it<BR>indefinitely elastic.&quot; However, Abacha came back with counter<BR>punches, telling Nigerians there was no need to complain because a<BR>three-year transition was not too long. &quot;The political programme<BR>itself is out and we believe this is the minimum time we need<BR>because our major problem as a nation is not politics itself. Our<BR>major problem as a nation is the socio-economic aspect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural<BR>Organisation has also joined those voicing their protest against<BR>political developments in Nigeria. UNESCO Director-General<BR>Federico Mayor on November 6 wrote to military ruler General Sani<BR>Abacha to express his concern over the death sentence passed on<BR>writer and minority rights leader Ken Saro-Wiwa. During UNESCO's<BR>28th General Conference, October 21 to November 17, at the<BR>organisation's headquarters in Paris, Mr. Mayor reminded Nigeria<BR>of its obligations as a United Nations member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN Under-Secretary told Nigerian Head of State; &quot;... I<BR>wish to lay stress on the importance that the Member States of<BR>UNESCO have attached to the promotion of tolerance, democratic<BR>values and human rights ever since the founding of the<BR>organisation 50 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Mayor particularly singled out the Recommendation<BR>Concerning the Status of the Artist which Nigeria, a UNESCO member<BR>had adopted. This recommendation affirms that artists are to be<BR>accorded protection by international and national legislation on<BR>human rights. The promotion of a culture of peace was a top<BR>priority of UNESCO's bi-annual conference which also coincided<BR>with the UN golden jubilee celebrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNESCO Director-General also noted that by participating in<BR>United Nations peace-keeping operations, Nigeria is playing an<BR>important role at the international level and especially in<BR>Africa, in favour of a culture of peace &quot;which depends essentially<BR>on tolerance, respect for human rights and democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Mayor's latest letter is a follow-up to an initial one sent<BR>to General Abacha at the start of the trial last January. UNESCO<BR>officially questioned Nigeria's permanent delegation about the<BR>matter on October 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of Abacha's determination to hold his countrymen to<BR>ransom, one wonders how long the world will sit and watch Nigeria<BR>slide into a catastrophe of monumental proportions in a continent<BR>that has already had more than enough bleeding.<BR>-0Angola</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The Kenya government's stand on the UN established<BR>War Tribunal to prosecute perpetrators of last years's genocide in<BR>Rwanda has elicited scathing criticisms from various groups, among<BR>them, the tribunal judge Justice Richard Goldstone, the Viceopposition Members of Parliament.<BR>President of Rwanda Major-General Paul Kagame and Kenya's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting sharply to a statement by President Moi to the effect<BR>that Kenya would not extradite Rwandese suspected of committing<BR>the genocide in their country unless those responsible for the<BR>root cause of the ethnic killings are also brought to book, MajorRwanda's problems.<BR>General Kagame said the Kenyan leader was not well placed to solve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Major Kagame, who is also his country's Minister for Defence<BR>alleged that President Moi shared all sorts of things with the<BR>Hutu killers wanted in Tanzania to answer charges of Rwanda<BR>genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rwanda VP drew comparison between Kenya's ethnic clashes<BR>between 1991 and 1993 in which hundreds of people were killed with<BR>last years' killings in Rwanda and said the two were similar.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said if President Moi wanted to get the truth about the<BR>shooting down of the plane in which President Juvenal Habyariamana<BR>of Rwanda and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi were killed, then he<BR>should look to France and not Rwanda as the evidence material had<BR>been carried to France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Goldstone on his part wrote to President Moi to clarify<BR>his October 4 comments on the UN War Tribunal on Rwanda's<BR>genocide. The South African judge warned that President Moi would<BR>be breaking international law if the Kenyan government arrested<BR>any of the UN appointed war tribunal members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the same issue, the British High Commission said<BR>that those responsible for the Rwanda killings should face justice<BR>but not by seeking refuge abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms. Gillian Uuilson speaking for the British High Commissioner<BR>to Kenya noted that those who participated in the genocide acts in<BR>Rwanda should be held individually responsible for their deeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of Kenya's opposition parties who reacted to Moi's<BR>stand, among them lawyer Paul Muite, dismissed the president's<BR>utterances on Rwanda's genocide. Muite said that it was not right<BR>for President Moi to allow his personal friendship with the late<BR>Habyarimana to prejudice Kenya's international foreign relations.<BR>He further argued that it appeared as if Kenya' s foreign policy<BR>was based on personal friendships rather than national interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muite, a member of the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy Rwandese criminals sought by the UN Security Council to stand<BR>Kenya (FORD-K) went even further to say he had evidence that the<BR>trial for genocide were staying in a residential estate in<BR>Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another opposition MP Mwai Kibaki of the Democratic Party (DP)<BR>who is also a former Vice President in Moi's government, denounced<BR>the president's stand on the war tribunal as illegal, adding that<BR>if the suspected criminals were living in Kenya, then they should<BR>appear before the tribunal for judgement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Federation for the Rights of Man in Paris in<BR>its condemnation of Moi's statement, noted that for the first<BR>time, a head of state which is a member of the United N ations had<BR>allowed himself to undermine the authority of the international<BR>tribunal set up to try those responsible for the genocide and<BR>crimes against humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The criticisms were triggered by a statement made by the Kenyan<BR>leader on October 4, 1995 while officially opening this year's<BR>Nairobi International Show to the effect that Kenya would not hand<BR>over any Rwandese to the international war tribunal to answer<BR>charges of genocide, since the UN Tribunal had not first<BR>investigated the longstanding crisis preceding the killing of the<BR>Rwandan and Burundian presidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moi said that although Kenya was a signatory to the UN<BR>convention, it would not accept partial application of the<BR>charter. Moi insisted that it was important for the UN to go<BR>beyond the genocide which arose from the killing of the two<BR>presidents last April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He particularly observed that prior to the shooting of the<BR>aircraft in which the two heads of state died, there were<BR>invasions of Rwanda and many people had been killed. Moi said the<BR>UN should therefore have in its terms of reference the reasons<BR>for these invasions and not just concentrate on the genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kenyan Head of State denied he was covering criminals from<BR>facing justice. In a somehow softer tone, he said he was not<BR>against the tribunal set up by the UN as Kenya was neither proAnd Kenya's Attorney General Amos Wako said the government was<BR>Hutu nor pro- Tutsi.<BR>not opposed to the extradition of those involved in the genocide<BR>and pointed out that Kenya would not shelter any suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No country can hide such suspects. But everything has to be<BR>dealt with in the normal way,&quot; said Mr. Wako, adding that all the<BR>president wanted was a comprehensive solution to the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Moi's view on the UN War Tribunal has since been<BR>supported by among others mainly from his ruling Kenya African<BR>National Union (KANU) party, his Minister for Education, Mr.<BR>Joseph Kamotho.<BR>-0Nigeria</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accra - Tension is rising between Christians and Muslims in<BR>Ghana following a series of religious clashes across the West<BR>African nation in the recent past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to reports compiled here in October, inter-faith<BR>clashes have occurred this year not only in Sekondi, 180<BR>kilometres west of the capital, Accra, but also in the country's<BR>second-largest city of Kumasi, 200 kilometres northwest of the<BR>capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Sekondi, a city of 220,000, an evangelist who converted from<BR>Islam said he had been forced into hiding after an attack and<BR>death threats for undertaking a mission &quot;to preach Jesus Christ to<BR>Muslims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abdramane Christian Asare claimed he had been forced to go<BR>underground after an attack in July led by Muslim youths accusing<BR>him of apostasy and said: &quot;As they charged on us they were<BR>shouting that I should be killed.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In early September, a dispute over the appointment of a new<BR>Muslim chief led to fighting in which 12 people were injured in<BR>Dawa, 65 kilometres east of Accra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of both faiths regularly fuel animosity through audio<BR>cassettes containing derogatory remarks about each other's<BR>prophets, Christ or Mohammed -- and which were played so often on<BR>state-owned buses that in March last year the corporation<BR>specifically banned their use. However, they are still often<BR>played by both Muslim and Christian preachers on private public<BR>address systems set up in public places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack on Asare took place in Sekondi during an open-air<BR>&quot;crusade&quot; by Asare 's Christ for the Muslim World Organisation,<BR>with the preacher pointing out that many Muslims regard apostasy<BR>as an offence punishable by death, unless the person concerned<BR>changed his or her mind within three days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another prominent Sekondi minister Daniel Agyare has accused<BR>the authorities of lack of interest in the evangelist's plight,<BR>charging: &quot;At the police station after the attack, we had the<BR>impression that the Muslims had a blank cheque to do whatever they<BR>wanted. Even at the police station they threatened to behead<BR>Asare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agyare warned that Christian youths in Sekondi were now arming<BR>themselves to resist any further attacks, and pointed out that<BR>freedom of religion and association were both guaranteed under<BR>Ghana's 1992 Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local Muslim youths have vowed that they will attack Asare as<BR>long as he continues to &quot;insult and attack Muslims in his<BR>preaching.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslim elders have, however, been more conciliatory, offering<BR>to pay for the damage in July's attack estimated to have been 11.5<BR>million cedis (about US dollars 10,000) in a bid to get the matter<BR>settled out of court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent years, Ghana has seen a series of religious and<BR>ethnic disputes, the most serious of which were clashes in the<BR>northeast of the country around Tamale, 420 kilometres north of<BR>Accra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting between ethnic Konkombas and their traditional<BR>overlords, the Dagombas plus allied Nanumbas and Gonjas left an<BR>official death toll of over 2,000 in February last year.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the dispute then largely centred on land rights, the<BR>rivalries had been made worse by the fact the Dagombas are<BR>traditionally Muslim, while many Konkombas are animist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>November 16, 1995 (19951116)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Uganda announced a new Constitution in October at a<BR>colourful ceremony attended by President Yoweri Museveni and his<BR>guest, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new Constitution reflects Uganda's past experience with<BR>tyrannical regimes. Consequently it has sought to limit the<BR>concentration of power in the hands of the presidency. For<BR>example, major appointments to public office will now be ratified<BR>by Parliament which will also regulate itself independently of the<BR>executive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new constitution and the occasion marking its promulgation<BR>were blessed by leaders of various religious faiths, among them<BR>Cardinal Emmanuel Wamala of the Catholic Church, Archbishop<BR>Livingstone Nkoyooyo of the Anglican Church (Church of Uganda)<BR>Theodorous Nankyama of the Orthodox Church and Muslim leader<BR>Sheikh Saad Luwemba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's new Constitution is the outcome of more than a year<BR>and a half of deliberations by over 285 Constituent Assembly<BR>Delegates (CADs), members of the Constituent Assembly (CA) who<BR>were elected countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the promulgation of the new Constitution, the CADs' tenure<BR>as people's representatives has effectively come to an end. The<BR>Constituent Assembly was duly dissolved the same day. Uganda will<BR>hold presidential and parliamentary elections before June next<BR>year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> James Wapakabulo who was chairman of the Constituent Assembly<BR>read the promulgation declaration on behalf of all CADs. But<BR>federalists in Uganda want to see greater power devolved to<BR>traditional kingdoms as was the case under the 1962 Constitution<BR>which former President Milton Obote abrogated unilaterally in<BR>1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the stipulations of the new Constitution, Ugandan<BR>aspirants to elective office will operate or organise<BR>individually, avoiding a party-style system of democracy for the<BR>next five years. At the end of five years, there will be a<BR>referendum through which voters will determine if the country<BR>should return to party-style democracy or any other representative<BR>system including independents or a mass movement system such as<BR>the National Resistance Movement of (NRM) President Yoweri<BR>Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because corruption has been the bane of all Uganda's regimes in<BR>the past including the current one of Museveni, the new document<BR>stipulates that Parliament will have absolute control over public<BR>funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new Constitution spells out radical innovations in the<BR>judiciary. The Chief Justice will no longer be head of the<BR>Judicial Service Commission. This means the Chief Justice will<BR>spend less time on purely administrative matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traditional rulers and the limits of their jurisdiction are<BR>clearly stated in the new Constitution that has eradicated the<BR>decree that abolished them 30 years ago. Federalists in Uganda,<BR>particularly in the populous central region of Buganda, want to<BR>see much more power returned to the old kingdoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the launching ceremony, Museveni said the new<BR>Constitution had ended the spate of &quot;jungle rule&quot; which he says<BR>characterised the administrations of Obote and Idi Amin. He said<BR>he was happy to have accomplished the goal he set when he came to<BR>power ten years ago -- to return Uganda to constitutional rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Constitution has restored what Obote took away from our<BR>people, enfranchising the people of Uganda. At the same time power<BR>has been decentralised from the centre to the regions, correcting<BR>the distortions made by Obote in 1966,&quot; added Museveni.<BR>-0Ghana</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - There are more than 2.5 million unemployed youths in<BR>Zambia, child, youth and sports minister Patrick Kafumukache told<BR>parliament yesterday. Kafumukache revealed the figure during his<BR>contribution to a motion for the adoption of a report of the<BR>committee on women, youth and child development.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The motion was earlier moved by Kanyama MMD MP Nakatindi Wina.<BR>He said as part of the government's efforts to solve the problem<BR>it had mobilised money from the World Bank for funding of youth<BR>projects starting next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seconding the motion, Kapoche UNIP MP Rev Ben Zulu told the<BR>house that the youth in the country were &quot;worse off &quot; because the<BR>government has abandoned many projects initially started by the<BR>UNIP government. The report was adopted unanimously. And deputy<BR>finance minister Paul Tembo said about K222.48 billion has been<BR>collected between May and September this year by the Zambia<BR>Revenue Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said K8.98 billion was contributed by government departments<BR>while K213.50 was from the private sector. Tembo was answering a<BR>question from Kafue MMD MP Yusuf Badat who wanted to know how much<BR>ZRA collected between May and September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tembo also revealed that Zambia earned about $324.9 million<BR>from traditional exports of copper and cobalt exports between May<BR>and September this year while it earned $95.1 in the same period<BR>from non-traditional exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between January and April this year, $324.9 was earned from<BR>traditional exports while $53.9 was from non-traditional ones.<BR>Tembo said the government accorded high priority to giving<BR>exporters incentives and promotion of non-traditional exports<BR>through reduction of export formalities and encouraging foreign<BR>exchange retention.<BR>-0Uganda</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Political turmoil in Africa has for a long time<BR>undermined the continent's ability to fullfil its potential in<BR>world sport, especially the world's number one, soccer, and the<BR>South African Football Association (Safa) decision to withdraw<BR>Nigeria's participation in the annual Simb Four Nations tournament<BR>again throws football in Africa into a state of confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tournaments of this nature are important because they not only<BR>strengthen our African ties but also test our weaknessess.<BR>Nigeria, currently ranked six and 35 respectively in African and<BR>world football, would have brought their experience in<BR>international competition with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's status in the finals of the African Nations Cup next<BR>year stays the same until the Confederation of African Football<BR>(CAF) rules otherwise. South Africa cannot refuse them entry if<BR>CAF has not expelled them from the competiton. However, a<BR>difficult problem would arise if any of the 16 finalists refuse to<BR>play Nigeria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's replacements Zimbabwe are also seasoned campaigners<BR>in international football. When South Africa was re-admitted into<BR>international football in 1992 they were beaten 4-1 by Zimbabwe in<BR>Harare. The secretary general of the Zimbabwe Football Association<BR>Phil Hwata could not confirm that Peter Ndlovu and Bruce<BR>Grobbelaar will be coming, saying:&quot;We have contacted both of them<BR>and they are willing to come.&quot; Ndlovu's younger brother Adam has<BR>confirmed his availability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since that famous Harare drubbing, the two sides have drawn one<BR>game and South Africa reversed the 1992 beating last year when<BR>Leeds striker Philemon Masinga scored in a friendly international<BR>in Mmabatho to give South Africa a 1-0 win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hwata said Zimbabwe's presence in Johannesburg should not be<BR>taken lightly as they hope to show that they should be in the<BR>African Nations Cup to be staged from January 13 to February 3<BR>next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the Zimbabwe players, including Ndlovu and Grobbelaar,<BR>refused to travel to Zaire for their CAF qualifying match against<BR>Zaire fearing the Ebola virus. Zimbabwe subsequently lost the<BR>game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile the Zambian squad that arrived on Tuesday were<BR>without four of their international players. Saudi Arabia-based<BR>players Harrison Chongo and Elijah Litana had not joined the squad<BR>and their coach Roald Poulsen said he was still awaiting their<BR>arrival. Johnson Bwalya and Kalusha Bwalya (no relation), who is<BR>based in Switzerland, were absent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Poulsen said they did not have most of their foreign stars but<BR>they have brought a respectable squad. He argued that one cannot<BR>read too much into these games. &quot;It is a good opportunity to test<BR>the players and the squad as a whole but it becomes a totally<BR>different situation when you play an official match as you will<BR>see when we come back in January.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa have played Zambia four times with Zambia winning<BR>two, South Africa winning the friendly international last year at<BR>Ellis Park and one draw in the CAF qualifying game in Lusaka last<BR>year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fourth team in the tournament, Egypt, will be coming here<BR>for the first time and they have never played South Africa in any<BR>capacity. But they have a strong team and will be force to be<BR>reckoned with in the African Nations Cup next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa have recalled most of their European-based players<BR>for the tournament, but unfortunately they will only arrive in the<BR>country next week. In the meantime coach Clive Barker will have to<BR>make do with local talent. Eric Tinkler, who plays in Portugal, is<BR>the only one available for the duration of the tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national team's training sessions ohave been disrupted<BR>because of domestic games, with some of the players having to<BR>return to their teams because of club commitments. Orlando Pirates<BR>requested that their players (Edward Motale, Mark Fish, John<BR>Moeti, Marks Maponyane and Innocent Mncwango), be left out of<BR>these games because of their involvement in the Africa Champions<BR>Cup final against Asec of Ivory Coast on December 2. Assistant<BR>coach Phil Setshedi said: &quot;We are still to make a decision&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another interesting question for the coach is Doctor Khumalo<BR>who has been ruled out of club soccer because of the botched<BR>transfer deal to an Argetinian team Oeste. He has not played<BR>professional football since the Mozambique friendly but the<BR>indications are that he will be played. Anyway he is training with<BR>the squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He will be considered because of his reputation,&quot; said<BR>Sethsedi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barker's boys cannot afford to slip up in any of these games.<BR>If they hope to win the public confidence for next years CAF games<BR>they have to start to impress now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tournament is played on a round robin system with South<BR>Africa tackling Zambia and Zimbabwe against Egypt in a doublethe FNB stadium next weekend.<BR>header at Mmabatho on Sunday. The next round of matches will be at<BR>-0Zambia</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>November 17, 1995 (19951117)<BR>by Niel Bierbaum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The South African Broadcasting Corporation<BR>(SABC) could be considering media mogul Rupert Murdoch as an<BR>international partner for its satellite venture. Such a deal could<BR>see the SABC exchanging an ownership share for exclusive rights to<BR>southern hemisphere rugby, which are held by Murdoch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although no deal has yet been signed, Murdoch's representatives<BR>have been in the country this week on a &quot;fact-finding mission&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have held talks with prospective broadcasters, with the<BR>Independent Broadcasting Authority and, according to SABC chief<BR>operating officer Gert Claasen, were given free rein at the SABC<BR>to &quot;ask anybody whatever questions they liked&quot;. Called at his<BR>Sandton hotel room this week, a Murdoch representative, Richard<BR>Dunn said, &quot;There is nothing to say. We are a long way from making<BR>any decisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Claasen insisted that &quot;no deal would be possible until we have<BR>decided how to structure our consortium&quot;. This consortium will<BR>involve foreign interests, but he reiterated that Murdoch is not<BR>the only player to whom they have spoken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others in the industry believe that an ownership share in<BR>exchange for rugby rights would give Murdoch a foot in the door in<BR>the South African market to the detriment of other players. One<BR>industry player proposed that South African channels should<BR>collectively agree to buy the rights from Murdoch rather do an<BR>ownership exchange with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to David Niddrie who is heading up the SABC satellite<BR>initiative, &quot;Just about everbody in the country is talking to<BR>Murdoch. South Africa should have access to broadcasters of<BR>international importance.&quot; Claasen seemed to have no problem with<BR>the fact that other commercial operators might see such a deal as<BR>treading on toes. &quot;At the end of the day, it will be a commercial<BR>decision,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some have questioned whether the SABC as the public service<BR>broadcaster should be getting involved in satellite television at<BR>all, particularly as the decision about its third channel has not<BR>yet been taken. The original idea behind the satellite service was<BR>to compensate for the expected revenue losses that the SABC claims<BR>would occur if it was to lose its third channel. The SABC has<BR>instead asked to retain its third channel, it has asked Parliament<BR>for R496-million and it wants to make money off a satellite<BR>service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jonathan Procter, managing director of potential satellite<BR>broadcaster Retcorp International, believes that the process<BR>should happen the other way around. &quot;The SABC would be an<BR>attractive partner in a local satellite initiative. It could offer<BR>terrestrial access to cross-market the satellite channels and so<BR>would warrant a shareholding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M-Net CEO Gerrie de Villiers points out that if the SABC were<BR>in the private sector they would first ask whether they could<BR>afford to do this. &quot;As a taxpayer I find it worrying that my<BR>public broadcaster could end up making losses of hundreds of<BR>millions of rands.&quot; De Villiers believes that such losses were<BR>likely as &quot;the SABC has problems making profits terrestrially.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Niddrie would not comment on the SABC's plans except to say<BR>that the satellite initiative would cost &quot;significantly less than<BR>a third&quot; of the R800-million quoted by this newspaper two weeks<BR>ago.<BR>-0South Africa</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The platinum market, although sensitive to<BR>sudden increases in supply, is unlikely to be hit too hard when<BR>the United States sells off its strategic stockpile of platinum as<BR>announced in September 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The US has not yet decided how much of its 453 000oz of<BR>platinum will be sold off or when but it is unlikely to be<BR>released into the market all at once,&quot; said Johnson Matthey<BR>marketing general manager Jeremy Coombes, speaking at the 1995<BR>interim review of the platinum industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coombes reported that platinum demand is expected to reach a<BR>new high this year, increasing four percent to 4,7-million oz<BR>compared with 1994. &quot;Much of the increase is from the industrial<BR>sector, particularly the chemical, petroleum refining, and glass<BR>fibre industry as well as from high-technology industries.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jewellery market -- led by Japan -- has moved from second<BR>place to first as the biggest consumer of platinum with 1,8Growth in the autocatalyst market -- the biggest consumer last<BR>million oz consumed in 1995 compared to 1,73-million oz last year.<BR>year -- has declined from 1,87-million oz in 1994 to 1,79-million<BR>oz this year, largely as a result of the switch to palladium<BR>autocatalysts by European manufacturers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> European manufacturers are adopting palladium rich autocatalyst<BR>systems in gasoline vehicles as it offers high temperature<BR>resistance, said Coombes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that on diesel cars -- which make up 25 percent of new<BR>cars in Europe -- there was wider use of platinum autocatalysts<BR>which would improve demand. He reported further increased demand<BR>for platinum autocatalysts from South East Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Demand for platinum investment products is expected to fall by<BR>30 000oz to 365 000oz in 1995 despite increased interest by Japan.<BR>European investment has declined as a result of Austria joining<BR>the European Union in January. Purchases of platinum coins in<BR>Austria formerly attracted no tax but with joining the European<BR>Union (EU), value added tax has now been imposed and demand has<BR>fallen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the US, stronger equity and bond markets have diverted<BR>investor attention away from platinum coins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Platinum supply is expected to increase by eight percent in<BR>1995 to reach 4,89-million ounces as a result of higher shipments<BR>from South Africa -- the world's biggest supplier of platinum --<BR>as well as an increase in Russian supplies which surged 190 000oz<BR>on last year's figure of 1,01-million oz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In our opinion, Russian sales are not equal to production and<BR>we expect at least 500 000oz to be drawn from state reserves,&quot;<BR>says Coombes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On South African supplies, he said the rise in production to<BR>3,35-million ounces was still below 1993 levels (3,36-million) but<BR>represented an increase of 190 000oz on last year's figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Additional metal is available from Amplats which is processing<BR>the concentrate backlog which occurred due to the reconstruction<BR>of its smelter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coombes said Implats' production had declined slightly as a<BR>result of an accident at the smelter in August this year and he<BR>added that he did not expect the merger between Implats and Lonrho<BR>Platinum division to affect overall platinum production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The price of platinum is expected to range between $400 and<BR>$440 an ounce during the next six months. It reached $460 in April<BR>this year but fell to below $420 in early October.<BR>-0South Africa</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A prince telling a court of law he took his<BR>orders unquestioningly from &quot;Mummy&quot;. A church minister and selffinancial records of an organisation to which he offered his<BR>appointed business consultant admitting he had no knowledge of the<BR>services. Stories of a costly and fruitless visit to a head of<BR>state to buy diamonds, supposedly in the interests of poverty<BR>relief work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such revelations in the Witwatersrand Supreme Court this week<BR>painted a chaotic picture of the workings of Co-ordinated Antihave been held together by nothing more than the magnetism of<BR>Poverty Programmes (Capp), the Section 21 company which appears to<BR>Winnie Mandela's personality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'd do anything for my mother-in-law as long as I thought it<BR>was for a good cause,&quot; Mandela's son-in-law Prince Musi Dhlamini<BR>of Swaziland insisted under cross-examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You went to see a head of state and didn't know whose business<BR>this was -- you expect the court to believe this?&quot; Sydney<BR>Nochumsohn, counsel for air charter company Foster Webb Hangars<BR>demanded incredulously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Yes,&quot; Dhlamini replied, unperturbed. &quot;I was there to introduce<BR>Ben du Preez to the president.&quot; The president in question was<BR>Angola's Eduardo dos Santos. Ben du Preez was a prospective<BR>diamond buyer, for whom Mandela had set up a meeting with Dos<BR>Santos. The meeting was to result in a diamond deal on which<BR>Mandela would take a 10 percent commission to benefit Capp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dhlamini never once referred to Mandela by name. She was always<BR>&quot;my mother-in-law&quot; or, more frequently, just &quot;Mummy&quot;. And the<BR>phrase &quot;that was none of my business&quot; ran through the prince's<BR>testimony like a refrain, as he denied all knowledge of the<BR>reasons for the Angola mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Why was a charter flight used, and not an ordinary aircraft?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That was none of my business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What was Capp's project?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;To raise funds in whatever way they thought possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What was the purpose of this trip?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I didn't know. I was asked by Mummy to take a delegation to<BR>Angola. I assumed Mummy was working for Capp and part of this<BR>would be Capp's business. I didn't ask Mummy. It was none of my<BR>business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Reverend Khumalo -- the Capp consultant -- what was he there<BR>to do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That was none of my business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev Tamasanqa Khumalo, who offered his services as a business<BR>adviser to Capp, revealed that his own knowledge of Capp's affairs<BR>was scanty. Khumalo told the court that he had never seen any<BR>business records which would have indicated whether Mandela had<BR>indeed booked the charter on behalf of Capp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet Khumalo's part-time presence in the organisation seemed to<BR>suggest that he was the only person with any financial skills at<BR>all. Khumalo said he had offered Mandela and Capp his services as<BR>a business consultant at no charge when he realised that Mandela<BR>was being exploited because she was helping companies to establish<BR>business contacts in African countries without demanding payment<BR>for this service. At the same time she was financing Capp out of<BR>her own pocket to the tune of R20 000 a month, he testified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khumalo advised Mandela to charge a commission when she set up<BR>business deals. It was one such deal which led Mandela to book a<BR>charter flight to Luanda in June 1993, the costs of which she was<BR>ordered to pay this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through her long-standing associate Peter Mokaba, Mandela had<BR>met Ben du Preez who wanted to buy diamonds in Angola -- Mandela,<BR>as a friend of Dos Santos, arranged a meeting between Du Preez and<BR>Dos Santos. At Du Preez' request, she also arranged the flight to<BR>Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Capp was set up as a Section 21 company in 1992 by Mandela and<BR>eight other directors, its stated objective being to combat<BR>poverty. Capp was in financial trouble by 1993, amid allegations<BR>that directors were using the company for their own gain. The<BR>Section 21 company still exists, but appears not to have operated<BR>since 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Capp appears to have operated on the basis of ad hoc decisions<BR>made by Mandela, sometimes acting on the advice of Khumalo. The<BR>court heard that the initial arrangements for the flight had been<BR>made by Mandela herself -- the final letter of confirmation bore<BR>Capp's letterhead and was signed by Mandela, but did not state in<BR>what capacity she was signing. Fatally for Mandela, Du Preez' name<BR>was not mentioned in the letter, which pointed to Mandela being<BR>solely responsible for the cost of the flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A post-dated cheque was offered in payment for the flight, the<BR>drawer of the cheque being Fortune Real Estate, whose owner, Zac<BR>Brainen, had also met Mandela through Mokaba. This arrangement was<BR>justified on the grounds that Capp had no cheque account. The<BR>cheque bounced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Angola trip turned out to be an expensive fiasco. Dos<BR>Santos ended the meeting after five minutes, saying that South<BR>Africans wishing to buy Angolan diamonds could do so through an<BR>agent in Johannesburg.<BR>-0South Africa</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>November 17, 1995 (19951117)<BR>by Phillip van Niekerk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa's belated determination to get<BR>tough on the Abacha regime should not blind us to the scale of<BR>President Nelson Mandela's miscalculation in initially urging the<BR>Commonwealth to go easy with the criminals of Abuja. South<BR>Africans will have some difficulty understanding the criticism,<BR>but it was picked up by the rest of the world who had looked to<BR>the prsident for moral leadership on the issue. For many Nigerians<BR>it meant nothing less than betrayal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would be unfair to imply that Mandela helped send Ken Sarobeen more open to the pleas and warnings of ordinary Nigerians,<BR>Wiwa and his colleagues to the gallows. But if the government had<BR>they would not have proved themselves so deficient in predicting<BR>events on a continent that South Africa aspires to lead.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We will never know if a strong, principled statement from<BR>Mandela -- calling not just for clemency, but condemning the<BR>whole trial as a set-up -- would have made any difference. Ken<BR>Saro-Wiwa is dead. Nor can there be doubt that Mandela's instincts<BR>would have led him to speak out more forcefully earlier. He was<BR>just hamstrung by a policy that was too clever by half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It should not have taken the murder of Saro-Wiwa to destroy<BR>South Africa's illusions about the nature of the Abacha regime.<BR>Mandela's own emissary, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, visited Chief<BR>Moshood Abiola in his cell in Abuja in April and witnessed first<BR>hand the delusional, slightly bizzarre behaviour of the ruling<BR>military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola, after all, is a man charged with &quot;treason&quot; for having<BR>proclaimed himself president after winning an election that the<BR>vast majority of Nigerians participated in. His accusers, who<BR>blithely insist that the &quot;judicial process&quot; should prevail, seized<BR>power through the gun-barrel of a tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu found Abiola's &quot;unsalubrious&quot; prison conditions so much at<BR>variance with what he had been led to expect from the generals<BR>that he wondered why they allowed him in at all. The millionaire<BR>businessman, used to the creature comforts of a luxury home at<BR>Ikeja outside Lagos, is no Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was willing to meet all of Abacha's conditions for his<BR>release, and more, including house arrest and a gag on political<BR>statements. But they were never serious about letting out such a<BR>symbol of democratisation and he is still rotting in his cell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refusing to be swayed by fancy theories, Tutu read the nature<BR>of the regime correctly and has been consistently spot-on where<BR>the official position has been off the mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha's contempt for Mandela's sweet reason prompted not a<BR>tougher official line but a softer one. Instead of supporting the<BR>democratic opposition, South Africa got drawn into a dubious form<BR>of &quot;constructive engagement&quot; with the dictators. When Deputy<BR>President Thabo Mbeki visited Abuja he did not see a single<BR>opposition leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's not as if different views are not there for the taking.<BR>Nigerians have strong opinions and are not afraid to express them.<BR>Nigeria has the most courageous, critical and well-written press<BR>in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the day Mbeki saw Abacha, 43 criminals were being executed<BR>by firing squad. The most damning fact about that, from the South<BR>African side, is that Mbeki was surprised. The executions were in<BR>public and were advertised in the newspapers days in advance. Why<BR>didn't the South African High Commission warn Mbeki?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Again, in the case of news about the confirmation of SaroPretoria would have been better served by subscribing to Reuters<BR>Wiwa's death sentence and the determination to carry them out,<BR>or monitoring the BBC Africa Service than waiting for information<BR>from the High Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But these failures belong in the domain of ineptitude which,<BR>one would hope, have their own rules of accountability. The more<BR>serious -- and now discredited -- philosophy underlying the<BR>dialogue approach is that, because we happen to inhabit the same<BR>continent as Nigeria, South Africans have a better understanding<BR>of Nigeria. Well, a thug is a thug on any continent, and Nelson<BR>Mandela has as much in common with Sani Abacha as Mussolini would<BR>have had with Mother Teresa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The adjunct to all of this -- that the British and the<BR>Americans didn't understand because they are not Africans -- was a<BR>failure to read what had been happening in Nigeria. The West has<BR>had cosy, cynical relationships with successive Nigerian regimes<BR>of every stripe. They folded their arms when the June 1993<BR>elections, the genesis of the present political crisis, were<BR>annulled by General Ibrahim Babangida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That they were finally stung into taking some kind of a stand<BR>against Abacha by Nigerian exiles and by political lobbies in<BR>their own countries is evidence that democracy sometimes works,<BR>not of western imperialism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a mark of extreme confusion that Deputy Foreign Minister<BR>Aziz Pahad can claim the softly-softly approach was correct as<BR>some sort of payback because &quot;we don't forget the role Nigeria<BR>played in our struggle&quot;. Does he not know that Nigerian support<BR>for the anti-apartheid movement came out of the monthly paychecks<BR>of ordinary people? That some of the African National Congress'<BR>strongest supporters, such as Abiola and General Olesugun<BR>Obasanjo, are in jail?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Does he really see no distinction between thieving and<BR>unpopular dictators imposing themselves through terror and murder,<BR>and the broad mass of Nigerian people?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha's attempts to undermine Abiola -- pointing that he too<BR>is tainted by corruption -- have been repeated in these parts as<BR>gospel. The fact is that Abiola won a legitimate election,<BR>declared free and fair by the international community, an election<BR>five years in the making, and -- most hopefully for a divided<BR>society such as Nigeria -- one in which a Muslim southerner won<BR>majority support from all regions, all ethnic groups, all<BR>religious factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, South Africa gave the dictators three years to<BR>implement a constitution that was produced by a conference less<BR>legitimate than South Africa's old President's Council. The<BR>document was only concluded after participants such as Shehu Musa<BR>Yar 'Adua, one of the few participants who had shown real courage,<BR>were removed from the conference and sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is my reading that Nigerians don't want the world, including<BR>South Africa, to solve their problems any more than the ANC wanted<BR>its friends in the international community to draw up the<BR>blueprint for South Africa's new constitution. International<BR>pressure was linked to specific targets: the release of political<BR>prisoners, the normalisation of politics, the creation of a fair<BR>framework to negotiate a settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerians looked to Mandela to take a strong stand, not<BR>because of our trade links with that country, but because the<BR>people of this continent see him as a fighter for justice. It will<BR>be a betrayal of all he stands for if South Africa continues to be<BR>seen as siding with corrupt elites in jackboots.<BR>-0South Africa</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)<BR>November 17, 1995 (19951117)<BR>by Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Naivety and inexperience in African affairs<BR>contributed to South Africa's failure to play a part in stopping<BR>the executions last week. Nigerian-born writer and academic,<BR>Professor Kole Omotoso -- better known to millions of television<BR>viewers as the uppity &quot;Gogo&quot; in a cellular telephone company's<BR>advertisement -- lost his dear friend Ken Saro-Wiwa to the<BR>hangman's noose, but believes Mandela is not to blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I honestly have sympathy with the South African government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">They didn't create the situation in Nigeria,&quot; Omotoso said. &quot;The<BR>ANC and PAC had relations with Nigeria, which were very helpful in<BR>the struggle against apartheid and I find it difficult now to<BR>condemn them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You cannot blame Mandela. The South African government is<BR>extremely inexperienced in foreign affairs, particularly as it<BR>applies to Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While many believed the Nigerian government was not capable of<BR>flying in the face of international outrage against the planned<BR>executions, Omotoso said he had warned the government was<BR>bloodthirsty and capable of doing it. &quot;Those who know my country<BR>know how irrational and illogical the military regime is. There<BR>wasn't a chance that it would respond to what Mandela called<BR>'softly-softly'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's support at the Commonwealth to suspend Nigeria<BR>and its withdrawal of its high commissioner for &quot;consultation&quot; was<BR>the correct approach, Omotoso said. It sent a strong message to<BR>the military regime that its actions were no longer a &quot;private<BR>affair&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omotoso welcomed the initiatives being taken by human rights<BR>and political organisations now to isolate Nigeria and support the<BR>movement for democracy there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is difficult for South Africans; there is a different kind<BR>of logic at work in Nigeria. South Africans are tremendously<BR>influenced by Western values and are now shocked that those same<BR>values do not apply in Nigeria and other parts of Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omotoso said what has pained him every day since Friday, when<BR>his friend Saro-Wiwa died, was that it had taken the deaths of<BR>nine people to wake the world up to what was happening in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;South Africans are beginning to learn that General Abacha will<BR>just laugh in their faces when they preach western values to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He supported the call for a boycott of Shell, saying<BR>multinationals could not hide behind excuses of autonomy for each<BR>country's operation -- the spoils all landed up in the home<BR>office's coffers.<BR>-0South Africa - Nigeria</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The full extent of government blundering over<BR>the Nigerian crisis began to emerge this week as officials tried<BR>to explain how they allowed the humiliation of Nelson Mandela at<BR>Auckland over the executions of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his fellow<BR>dissidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail &amp; Guardian learnt this week that a vital 24 hours was<BR>wasted before South African Foreign Affairs began moving to try to<BR>save them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was also major confusion of responsibility within the<BR>Foreign Affairs Department over the crisis. The deputy minister,<BR>Aziz Pahad, said this week that South Africa's high commissioner<BR>in Lagos, George Nene, had instructions to maintain contact with<BR>Nigerian dissidents and had been doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Nene, re-called this week for &quot;consultations&quot;, said he had<BR>not interpreted contact with the opposition as his brief; his duty<BR>had been primarily to liaise on a government level.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Not one of the civil liberty or pro-democracy groups has<BR>knocked on my door and said, 'Let's discuss things,' the high<BR>commissioner complained, arguing the onus for contact had been on<BR>the Nigerian opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's approach to Nigeria exploded in the face of<BR>President Mandela at what should have been a triumphant appearance<BR>at his first Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in New<BR>Zealand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hanging of the nine dissidents came after desperate appeals<BR>from their supporters for a tougher approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Figures like Nigerian Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka charged South<BR>Africa with &quot;appeasement&quot; and compared the strategy of &quot;quiet<BR>diplomacy&quot; to the notorious strategy of &quot;constructive engagement&quot;<BR>adopted by the Thatcher and Reagan administrations in dealing with<BR>the apartheid government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian expatriates and South African civil liberties group<BR>Lawyers for Human Rights made frantic efforts to get Foreign<BR>Affairs mobilised to save Saro-Wiwa and his comrades after the<BR>Reuters news agency first broke the news on Wednesday last week<BR>that the military junta had confirmed the death sentences. The<BR>Nigerians knew from experience this meant the executions were<BR>imminent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Department of Foreign Affairs refused to act, however,<BR>until they had received &quot;confirmation&quot; of the announcement, which<BR>they did not obtain until the following day. High Commissioner<BR>Nene then tried, but failed, to contact the Nigerian government<BR>with the appeal: &quot;Don't do this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lack of preparedness of President Mandela in Auckland for<BR>the looming tragedy was demonstrated by his statement on the<BR>Thursday that South Africa was standing by its policy of quiet<BR>diplomacy and there would be &quot;time enough&quot; to opt for stronger<BR>measures if persuasion failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the executions, virtually nothing has been heard from<BR>South Africa's Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, and Deputy President<BR>Thabo Mbeki -- the first of whom carries constitutional<BR>responsibility for his department; the latter believed to have<BR>been largely responsible for formulating policy on the Nigerian<BR>issue. Instead, Nzo's deputy, Pahad, has been left to carry the<BR>can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week Pahad told a media conference in Pretoria that South<BR>Africa's policy towards Nigeria could not be compared with the<BR>1980s &quot;constructive engagement&quot; of the United States and Britain<BR>towards apartheid. He said those countries had hidden behind the<BR>policy to avoid pushing for real change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We do not see anything wrong in principle with constructive<BR>engagement, but that does not mean weak constructive engagement.&quot;<BR>Pahad later said: &quot;The entire world was caught unawares ... so I<BR>don't think (Foreign Affairs officials) could have had a finger on<BR>the pulse of such a controversial decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pahad countered criticism that he and Mbeki had not seen<BR>opposition leaders during a visit to Nigeria earlier this year,<BR>saying time had been limited. He pointed to the success of the<BR>mission, which some feel was a deciding factor in Abacha's October<BR>1 commutation of death sentences against former Nigerian ruler<BR>General Olusegun Abasanjo and other &quot;coup plotters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Pahad said Nene had instructions to maintain contact with<BR>Nigerian opposition groups. Nene told the M&amp;G that he had had<BR>regular contact with the wives of Obasanjo and Moshood Abiola (the<BR>imprisoned, presumed winner of Nigeria's annulled presidential<BR>elections). He said he saw the wives as &quot;family representatives&quot;<BR>rather than representatives of the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rejecting criticism of South Africa by the Nigerian opposition,<BR>he said: &quot;It is easy for them to criticise President Mandela in<BR>the press.&quot; Pointing to divisions among Nigerian opposition<BR>groups, he said they could not expect stronger action from foreign<BR>governments if they could not agree on action themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nene, who was appointed high commissioner in February after<BR>serving as African National Congress representative to Nigeria<BR>since 1989, said Britain and the United States, both of which<BR>&quot;have better systems of getting information&quot;, had erred similarly.<BR>&quot;Until the sentences were carried out, all of us thought it would<BR>not happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pahad replied that if Nene had not made contact with opposition<BR>groups, &quot;he must explain&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TIMETABLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following are the events surrounding the executions of Ken<BR>Saro-Wiwa and his eight fellow dissidents at Port Harcourt:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Tuesday October 31: A military tribunal appointed by the<BR>Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) of Nigerian military dictator<BR>General Sani Abacha hands down death sentences, with no option to<BR>appeal, against Saro-Wiwa, Barinem Kiobel, John Kpunien, Baribor<BR>Bera, Saturday Dobee, Felix Nwate, Norde Eawo, Paul Levura and<BR>Daniel Gbokwo. South Africa informs Nigeria's high commissioner in<BR>Pretoria the sentences are unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Monday November 6: Deputy President Thabo Mbeki tries,<BR>apparently without success, to contact Abacha to ensure he will be<BR>attending the Commonwealth summit in New Zealand later in the<BR>week, so the sentences and Nigeria's transition to democracy can<BR>be discussed. (Abacha did not come, sending Foreign Minister Tom<BR>Okimi instead.)<BR> .* Wednesday November 8, about noon: Reuters news agency reports<BR>the PRC met earlier in the day and confirmed the death sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ...* Wednesday November 8, after 9pm: South Africa's Lawyers<BR>for Human Rights (LHR) hears from a Nigerian opposition group that<BR>the PRC had confirmed the sentences, and is told by Nigerian<BR>contacts the PRC is not bluffing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LHR calls the Department of Foreign Affairs, and ends up<BR>speaking to Johann Marx, head of the section dealing with Nigeria.<BR>Marx tells LHR no strong action can be taken until his department<BR>has had confirmation of the PRC decision. LHR tells him Reuters<BR>and other sources confirmed it. He tells LHR he would have to<BR>check it with Nene, South Africa's high commissioner in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marx calls Nene, who says he is in no position to confirm the<BR>PRC decision and suggests they wait for confirmation in the<BR>Nigerian media or work on it in the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ...* Thursday November 9, morning: Nene gets the confirmation<BR>in the Nigerian media. He tries to contact senior Nigerian<BR>government officials with the message, &quot;Don't do this&quot;. He fails<BR>to make contact. (Only after the hangings does he succeed in<BR>making contact.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the Commonwealth heads of government and their<BR>delegations gather in Auckland. Mandela and others appeal for a<BR>stay of execution, but Mandela defends his policy of quiet<BR>diplomacy, saying the time for sanctions and stronger action has<BR>not come -- and that there will be &quot;time enough&quot; to consider<BR>these if persuasion fails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ...* Friday November 10, about 11am: Saro-Wiwa and his fellow<BR>activists are hanged in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Foreign Affairs in<BR>South Africa gets the news before Nene, who confirms to them later<BR>in the day: &quot;Yes, it looks like it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ...* Saturday November 11, early morning: Mandela and other<BR>Commonwealth heads of government are told about the hangings.<BR>Mandela, in his own words &quot;almost out of control&quot; with anger,<BR>calls for Nigeria's immediate expulsion from the Commonwealth.<BR>(This position is later ameliorated, in consultation with other<BR>heads of government, to a two-year suspension. Expulsion will come<BR>if there are further gross human rights abuses or if Nigeria's<BR>movement to democracy is unsatisfactory.)<BR>-0South Africa and Nigeria</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - National coach Clive Barker will ensure that the<BR>South African squad is fired up and ready for action it takes<BR>centre stage in the forthcoming Simba Four Nations Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been mixed reaction from soccer critics about the<BR>seriousness with which the participating countries are approaching<BR>the annual tournament, with a lot of pessimists saying it will be<BR>a damp squib.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four countries -- South Africa, Zambia, Nigeria and Egypt --<BR>will take part in the soccer fiesta, which kicks off on November<BR>18, and which will be a prelude to the grand Africa Cup of<BR>Nations(ACN) taking place from January 13 to February 3 next year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is speculation that of the four countries, only South<BR>Africa will field the strongest possible side, with the other<BR>three having to opt for makeshift teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is because key players from the three countries, who are<BR>professionals in Europe, will not be available, as their countries<BR>do not take the tournament seriously enough to recall them--let<BR>alone when the continent's prestige ACN is just around the corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But what makes the pessimists' argument lose sense is the fact<BR>that a staggering R180 000 will be pocketed by the winner of this<BR>round-robin competition, while the runners-up will go home with an<BR>equally huge cash incentive R80 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There will be al lot at stake and I do not believe these<BR>nations can afford to ignore such incentives, especially as most<BR>of them are going through a lean spell,&quot; said Safa's executive<BR>president Solomon &quot;Sticks&quot; Morewa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morewa's sentiments were echoed by Barker who dismissed as<BR>&quot;unfounded&quot; allegations that the three countries would send<BR>second-rate sides to such a reputable competition&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am not taking chances and I will field my strongest possible<BR>side in the three games,&quot; said Barker who hinted that he might<BR>recall all of his overseas-based professionals to beef up the<BR>squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's irreplaceable&quot; captain Kalusha Bwalya is definitely<BR>out as his Mexican club, AS America, are campaigning strongly for<BR>league honors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, that does not mean that Zambia are a one-man team,<BR>according to Barker. &quot;They have played several matches without<BR>Kalusha and have done exceptionally well, so his unavailability<BR>does not make much difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia which has a population of nine million and more than 200<BR>registered clubs, has one of the most flawless records on the<BR>continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were runners-up for the Africa Nations Cup in 1994, thirdthis year, they beat Korea 3-2 in the Korea Cup. They also<BR>placed in 1982 and 1990, and runners-up in 1994. And on June 10<BR>finished their Africa Cup of Nations qualifying group with a<BR>comprehensive 2-0 win over Mauritius, whom they had earlier<BR>thumped 3-0.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for Egypt, with or without its overseas-based professionals,<BR>this large north African nation, which has won the ACN three<BR>times, has the potential to assemble a formidable team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a population of 55-million, Egypt has approximately 250<BR>registered clubs from which to choose players for its national<BR>side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Current ACN champions, Nigeria, need no introduction. With a<BR>population of over 90-million and a record 500 registered clubs<BR>from which to select its national squad, the west African country<BR>poses the greatest threat to South Africa's ambitions.<BR>-0South Africa and Nigeria</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - The East and Central Senior Challenge Cup is<BR>scheduled to kick off on November 25 and there is already good<BR>news that it will be an expanded version. Rwanda and Burundi on<BR>Friday confirmed that they will be in Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regional championship lost some glamour when Zambia, Malawi<BR>and Zimbabwe pulled out due to lack of incentives. Since then<BR>Djibouti, Seychelles, Eritrea and now Burundi and Rwanda have<BR>joined the CECAFA family.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to FUFA Chairman Twaha Kakaire, preparations for the<BR>challenge cup have reached final stages and he expressed<BR>confidence that it will be a smooth run during the tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kakaire further said that so far only eight countries have<BR>confirmed their participation in the two week tournament and they<BR>are; hosts Uganda who are fielding two teams, defending champions<BR>Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Burundi, Eritrea and Zanzibar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kakaire revealed that the information he has from the CECAFA<BR>Secretariat in Nairobi is that, three countries Sudan, Djibouti,<BR>and Seychelles were yet to confirm participation by last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twaha also confirmed that Nakivubo and Bugembe Stadium will be<BR>the two venues for this year's Senior Challenge Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fixtures for the championships will be released after the<BR>CECAFA Secretariat has confirmed the number of teams taking part.<BR>The teams are expected to start arriving from November 22 and<BR>those based in Kampala will be accommodated at the Post Office<BR>Hostel in Nakawa, east of Kampala and at Silver Springs while<BR>those in Jinja will reside at Kalinie and Fairway Inn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two Uganda teams, The Cranes and Kobs are in serious<BR>residential training at Lugogo and all stones are being turned in<BR>a bid to recapture the cup Uganda last won in 1992 in Mwanza. That<BR>time, Uganda played without SC Villa players who were engaged in<BR>the CAF Cup finals against Shooting Stars of Nigeria. SC Villa<BR>lost 0-3 on aggregate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cranes beat Kakuona, the Tanzania B side 1-0 to take the<BR>cup for keeps. The Cranes lost in the finals to Tanzania last year<BR>the spot kicks after drawing 2-2. The Challenge Cup was not held<BR>in 1993 due to lack of hosting nation after Ethiopia pulled out.<BR>Uganda would have hosted the meet but because of bad blood between<BR>the Semanobe FUFA and NCS, Uganda government cancelled the offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Express will represent Uganda in this year's East<BR>and Central Club Championships to be held in Tanzania's towns of<BR>Dar-es-Salaam and Mwanza. The regional club tourney starts<BR>December 23 and ends January 13, 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobia - South African clergy and Nobel Peace Prize winner<BR>Archbishop Desmond Tutu, has cited corruption, mismanagement and<BR>lack of accountability, among some African leaders as major blocks<BR>to the continent's hope for survival in the next century .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Archbishop of Cape Town nevertheless urges Africans to<BR>maintain the hope for survival although total victory, would<BR>depend on their leaders' change of heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Delivering a public lecture on October 7 under the topic,<BR>&quot;Africa's dilemma: Conflicts, Challenges and Possibilities,&quot;<BR>Bishop Tutu told his Kenyan audience; &quot;Our leaders must have a<BR>change of heart. They must be ready to say &quot;NO&quot; to issues such as<BR>corruption, mismanagement and lack of accountability if we are to<BR>be assured of our survival in the next century. This is a must<BR>that should be followed with action.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Criticising African governments in general about their spending<BR>on defence which reflects in most cases a reasonably large share<BR>of the total national budget, Tutu wondered why Africa would want<BR>to be over-militarised and questioned the role of military people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He dared his audience to show him one army in Africa that has<BR>brought peace. All have dismally failed in their defence against<BR>external aggression, he said. &quot;They are (neo-colonial) masters and<BR>instruments of repression,&quot; added Tutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arguing that Africa should endeavour by all means to reduce her<BR>military numbers and spending on defence, Tutu observed; &quot;In a<BR>normal situation, we should have less money allocated for defence<BR>and much of it going into viable and needy sectors such as<BR>education, health and agriculture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia, was<BR>said to have been spending an estimated 40 per cent of the<BR>national budget on arms in the name of national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The African persons continue to suffer from the effects of<BR>corruption and mismanagement among the leaders. As a result, we<BR>have a continent, endowed with massive natural resources, but<BR>which is unable to feed her people,&quot; lamented Tutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AACC president pointed out that the notion that political<BR>power was the gate way to prestige and riches had corrupted<BR>African leadership. He added, &quot;they (leaders) know that the<BR>minute they step down, things will go bad. Those beautiful convoys<BR>and houses will disappear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He did not spare such leaders regarding their influence on<BR>democratic systems, through which the people would effectively<BR>elect their leaders. Such systems are so eroded in some African<BR>countries that they hardly work. &quot;We must make our governments<BR>democratic and participatory, strengthen civil societies and make<BR>leaders accountable,&quot; added Tutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On military coups on the continent, the AACC president said;<BR>&quot;because of the false promises some African leaders have made to<BR>their subjects, people have tended to welcome coups wherever they<BR>occur with one simple thinking that 'this one' will bring peace<BR>and reality to the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When a coup occurs, people celebrate because they have a<BR>natural desire for freedom and when a dictator bites the dust they<BR>are happy,&quot; added the South African clergy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On refugees, the AACC president said although many of them were<BR>as a result of man-made and natural calamities, most of the<BR>problems associated with the presence of such displaced people had<BR>a lot to do with massive violation of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He nevertheless echoed a message of hope singling out South<BR>Africa as a recent show case. &quot;In a special way South Africa,<BR>should stand out as a sign of hope for Africa. In a special way it<BR>has so far proved to the rest of the world that it is possible to<BR>make colour and race irrelevant in the life of the people and the<BR>country too,&quot; Tutu noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's swift transition from apartheid to democracy<BR>should give hope to other countries that have lost hope. &quot;Who<BR>would have thought South Africa would be where it is now? Who<BR>would have known that South Africa's president Nelson Mandela<BR>would be the world's most admired and popular leader?&quot; he posed.<BR>-0Uganda</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>November 6, 1995 (19951106)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luanda - A Canadian volunteer with the inter-Church Coalition<BR>for Africa (ICCAF) an affiliate of the Canadian Council of<BR>Churches, has urged the international non-governmental<BR>organisations (NGOs) and the United Nations in Angola to value<BR>Angolan partners (Angolan NGOs) and use every opportunity to<BR>strengthen them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jim Kirkwood of ICCAFs human rights working group, at the end<BR>of a two- week mission to Angola in September, says all over<BR>Angola United Nations agencies like the World Food Programme (WFP)<BR>and the international NGOs fulfil the role of government and civil<BR>service &quot;and the people look up to these NGOs and the WFP for<BR>their needs to be supplied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is not much of an exaggeration to say the UN fulfils the<BR>role of government in Angola as far as providing direction and<BR>planning; and the International NGOs are the civil service as far<BR>as providing services is concerned,&quot; says ICCAF.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kirkwood observes, in the absence of a functioning civil<BR>administration in the northern town of Malanje, the NGOs &quot;are like<BR>new village headmen&quot;- with &quot;this garden area for World Vision,<BR>that one for Save the Children, Caritas or Action for Rural<BR>Development and Environment (ADRA) etc.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All these NGOs are either international or have international<BR>partners who control their work directly or indirectly by the<BR>resources they may choose to make available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kirkwood further notes that expatriates have much easier access<BR>to government, UN and NGO offices than Angolans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With some justification one reason for this is that the UN sees<BR>NGOs as impartial and prefers them for aid distribution. By<BR>contrast Angolan groups may well be thought of as biased towards<BR>their own members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the preference for International NGOs &quot;is very short<BR>signed,&quot; warns Kirkwood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believes this is the right time to build the capacity and<BR>expertise of the local NGOs because eventually when the crisis<BR>recedes and the international NGOs return to Europe and Africa, it<BR>is the local NGOs which will carry on the work.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Kenya's National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB), a<BR>parastatal buying and selling cereals, is in the process of<BR>exporting 270,000 metric tonnes of white maize worth US dollars<BR>45.2 million (KShs.2,486 million) to southern African countries<BR>between October 1995 and February(March 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once concluded, the maize export process will facilitate the<BR>clearing of outstanding payment to Kenyan maize farmers totalling<BR>KShs. 1.0 billion (US dollars 18.18 million) as well as the<BR>turnover of stocks currently standing at 7.56 (90 kg) million bags<BR>held by the board. This in turn is expected to clear space for the<BR>1995 bumper harvest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a press statement October 26, signed by the NCPB<BR>Managing Director Maj. Rtd. W. K. Koitaba, the contracts to export<BR>the Kenyan maize were awarded to two international commodity<BR>dealers following floating of tender in June, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NCPB statement further said that there is an acute shortage<BR>of white maize in the southern African region, a situation that<BR>has triggered off high demand for the commodity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman from the Zimbabwean High Commission here said his<BR>country needs between 400,000 to 800,000 metric tonnes of white<BR>maize, the staple food. However, he added, &quot;we have not made any<BR>contract with Kenya yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the Trade Commissioner at the South African Mission<BR>here told APS that his country was importing white maize from<BR>Kenya. He did not give further details about the deal between the<BR>two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The southern African region comprising South Africa, Lesotho,<BR>Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Mozambique, Malawi, Angola, Botswana, Namibia<BR>and Zambia experienced drought in 1994(95, with some areas so<BR>seriously affected that livestock and wildlife were reported<BR>dying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest contract brings to 350,000 tonnes of maize sold to<BR>southern African countries this year by the NCPB. The maize, worth<BR>US dollars 63 million (approximately KShs 3.5 billion ) has been<BR>sold through two commodity brokers namely M(S Glencore Grain<BR>Rotterdam B.V of Rotterdam, Netherlands, and M(S International<BR>Commodity Dealers Limited of United Kingdom. Already, some 25,000<BR>tonnes of maize are reported to have been delivered to South<BR>Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya has for the last two years experienced favourable weather<BR>conditions leading to good maize harvests. Mr. J.K. Kemei, public<BR>relations officer with the NCPB said that the board was in the<BR>process of making negotiations to sell a further 3 million (90<BR>kilogramme) bags of white maize in readiness for the new crop.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington - Republican Senator Nancy Kassebaum, Chairman of<BR>the Senate African Affairs Subcommittee, yesterday introduced a<BR>bill which, if passed, would impose additional but still limited<BR>sanctions on the Nigerian government. The bill is co- sponsored by<BR>Senators Leahy (D-VT), Feingold (D-WI), Jeffords (R-VT), Simon (Dto be introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative<BR>IL) and Pell (D-RI). A new bill on the same issue is also expected<BR>Donald Payne (D-NJ) and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kassebaum's bill adds new sanctions, including a ban on all new<BR>U.S. investment in Nigeria, including the energy sector; and a<BR>freeze on the personal assets of top officials of the Nigerian<BR>regime. The bill stops short of the comprehensive embargo on<BR>Nigerian oil which many groups are calling for. But it does call<BR>for the U.S. to build international support for a multilateral<BR>arms embargo, and for consideration of a unilateral arms embargo<BR>within three months after enactment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Groups supporting democracy in Nigeria will be considering over<BR>the next weeks whether the Kassebaum bill is strong enough to<BR>deserve support as a first step, or whether there is the<BR>possibility for finding support in Congress for even stronger<BR>legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measures in the bill move significantly beyond the<BR>sanctions already imposed by the Clinton administration, and are<BR>sure to meet intense opposition from oil companies and others<BR>opposed to economic sanctions against the Nigerian military<BR>regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The press release and summary of the bill prepared by Senator<BR>Kassebaum's office are attached below:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kassebaum Seeks Sanctions against Nigeria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - November 17, 1995 - In response to the<BR>executions of nine political activists last week in Nigeria and<BR>deteriorating economic and political conditions in the country,<BR>Senate African Affairs Subcommittee Chairman Nancy Landon<BR>Kassebaum, R-Kan., introduced legislation today imposing a series<BR>of sanctions against the Nigerian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The situation in Nigeria has reached the point where we simply<BR>must respond in a forceful and clear manner,&quot; Kassebaum said.<BR>&quot;General Abacha and the Nigerian military leadership must<BR>understand that the United States will not stand idle as they drag<BR>their country into chaos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The legislation imposes several new, tough sanctions including<BR>a ban on all new U.S. investment in Nigeria, including the energy<BR>sector, and a freeze on the personal assets of top officials of<BR>the Nigerian regime. In addition, the measure urges the President<BR>to build international support for other actions, including a U.N.<BR>arms embargo, a multilateral oil embargo, and a U.N. Human Rights<BR>Commission condemnation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bill also codifies a number of sanctions already imposed by<BR>the administration, including a ban on foreign aid, military<BR>sales, and export financing; a termination of air flights between<BR>Nigeria and the United States; an end to U.S. support for Nigeria<BR>the World Bank, IMF and other international financial<BR>institutions; and a visa ban on any Nigerian who formulates,<BR>implements or benefits from policies which hinder Nigeria's<BR>transition to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We must send an unambiguous and tough signal to General<BR>Abacha,&quot; Kassebaum said. &quot;If you move toward respecting human<BR>rights and instituting a new, civilian regime, the sanctions will<BR>be lifted and we will welcome Nigeria back as a partner and friend<BR>in the international community. If you continue to move in the<BR>wrong direction, the isolation will grow and the economic price<BR>will be high.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The brutal murder of Nigeria's minority rights<BR>campaigner, Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni leaders, by<BR>General Sani Abacha, has exposed the lack of moral authority and<BR>resolve, and the general cowardice of the present crop of world<BR>leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although when he was sentenced to death by a military tribunal<BR>on October 31, Saro-Wiwa sounded courageous, he never really<BR>thought the military authorities in Nigeria would have the nerves<BR>to carry out the sentence, given the clout of &quot;powerful friends&quot;<BR>he had in the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One such friend is President Nelson Mandela of South Africa,<BR>who was expected to use his influence with General Abacha to spare<BR>Saro-Wiwa and his co-convicts. Said the writer, playwrite and<BR>environmental activist when the verdicts were announced: &quot;I was<BR>judged guilty even before I was tried. Now you (tribunal) have<BR>confirmed that verdict, I am happy the country has benefited from<BR>the idea which MOSOP (Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni<BR>People) stood for. We in MOSOP have made a very wonderful<BR>contribution to this country.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as he arrived in Auckland, New Zealand, for the<BR>Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Mr Mandela sent out the<BR>wrong signal, arguing that it was too early to talk of imposing<BR>sanctions and harsher measures against the military regime.<BR>Instead, he advocated for a softly diplomatic approach and<BR>dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those sentiments stemmed from the fact that during the<BR>apartheid years, Nigeria led the African onslaught against racial<BR>discrimination in South Africa. However, unfortunately, Mandela<BR>failed to separate Nigeria as a nation from a regime which has no<BR>mandate to rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And so, the &quot;butcher of Abuja,&quot; as Abacha has been dubbed in<BR>some quarters, immediately saw a loophole and lack of coherence in<BR>world opinion and slapped everyone in the face. In a space of just<BR>two years, Abacha has turned Nigeria into an abattoir and marks<BR>this November the second anniversary of his coming to power, his<BR>hands stained with the blood of Saro-Wiwa and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world had been warned when death sentences were imposed on<BR>the nine Ogoni leaders in a murder trial that human rights<BR>organisations considered seriously flawed, lacking due process of<BR>law, and politically motivated. Nigerian Nobel Prize-Winner, Prof<BR>Wole Soyinka, called on Commonwealth leaders to impose &quot;total<BR>isolation&quot; on Abacha and his collaborators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Commonwealth has got surely to stop playing footsie with<BR>this regime,&quot; he told British television. &quot;It is a brutal regime<BR>and nothing but the strictest sanctions, total isolation of this<BR>regime will save their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing a news conference two days before the start of the<BR>53-nation Commonwealth Summit, Saro-Wiwa's son, Ken Wiwa, warned<BR>that the summit represented his father's last chance. &quot;It is<BR>important for the Nigerian people...that world opinion and<BR>politicians here at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting<BR>take up this challenge and do something about the human rights<BR>abuses in Nigeria,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Otherwise...I would accuse them of complicity with the<BR>Nigerian authorities in the human rights abuses in Nigeria.&quot;<BR>Declared by Amnesty International as prisoners of conscience,<BR>Saro- Wiwa, who headed MOSOP, and his colleagues were arrested and<BR>charged with murder in May last year following violence in which<BR>four pro-government Ogoni chiefs were allegedly killed by their<BR>supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the deaths of the four Ogoni chiefs must be condemned,<BR>many Nigerians and international observers believe the hangings of<BR>the MOSOP activists have more to do with silencing dissent than<BR>the murder of the chiefs. If we were to execute all politicians<BR>for the actions of their supporters rather than deal directly with<BR>the supporters, then no politicians will be left in Africa, both<BR>in the government and the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Throughout the continent, from Accra to Nairobi, and from Cairo<BR>to Cape Town, violence between opposing groups has led to the<BR>deaths, at one time or another of countless numbers of people. The<BR>real crime for which Saro-Wiwa and the eight Ogoni leaders were<BR>executed was their campaign against the pollution and degradation<BR>of Ogoniland by the giant Anglo-Dutch Shell Petroleum Company, and<BR>for a fair share of oil extracted from the land. Mr. Saro- Wiwa,<BR>who had served in various capacities under past administrations,<BR>fell out with the establishment immediately he began raising<BR>awareness about the environmental damage done to his native<BR>Ogoniland in the southern oil-rich Rivers State and their years of<BR>marginalisation by the authorities. He had shaken the foundation<BR>of the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authorities felt he was &quot;too loud&quot; as to campaign for the<BR>rights of the 500,000 inhabitants of Ogoniland out of the<BR>country's population of over 100 million. As Tribunal Chairman<BR>Ibrahim Auta pronounced the sentences in the Rivers State capital,<BR>Port Harcourt, the fallen writer's colleagues in Nigeria and<BR>Britain, the colonial power, reacted in the language they know<BR>best - the language of the pen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Booker Prize winning Nigerian author, Ben Okri, warned of<BR>terrible consequences after the death sentence was imposed on<BR>Saro-Wiwa. &quot;When you hear that writers have been inexplicably<BR>murdered, silenced... that grotesque lies are told about them...<BR>but above all, when you hear that writers have been sentenced to<BR>death by undemocratic tribunals, then you can be sure that the<BR>perils and the demons of war and the angels of fragmentation have<BR>already begun their dreaded descent...&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said British novelist William Boyd: &quot;It is a measure of the<BR>moral bankruptcy of General Abacha and his junta that they have<BR>had to flout every standard of civilised and judicial behaviour in<BR>order to quieten the voice of one brave writer fighting for his<BR>people's rights.&quot; Wole Soyinka described the trial as a &quot;lethal<BR>charade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Saro-Wiwa waited in vain for the world to act decisively to<BR>save his life, and in the event, they failed, as insanity<BR>prevailed over the civilised world. Despite pleas for clemency<BR>from various world leaders and governments, including the United<BR>States and Britain, Nigeria's Provisional Ruling Council (PRC)<BR>went ahead and confirmed the sentences on November 8, and Abacha<BR>carried out the executions on November 10, the day Commonwealth<BR>leaders began their meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saro-Wiwa was betrayed and let down by the world, including<BR>powerful countries like the United States and Britain, who have<BR>the political and economic clout to stop the jungle action of an<BR>individual member of the world community. Unfortunately, the world<BR>faces an unmitigated crisis of human rights abuses, where the<BR>powerful West, in theory, advocates for the upholding of<BR>fundamental human rights, but in practice, it has often allowed<BR>economic interests to take precedence over the sanctity of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, the United States alone consumes 75 per cent of<BR>Nigerian oil, and so it has tolerated the brutality committed by<BR>the military in that country for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behind Saro-Wiwa's back came the world outrage when<BR>Commonwealth leaders poured out the befitting epithets available<BR>in the English language to describe the Nigerian action. The<BR>hangings were described as &quot;a slap in the face of Commonwealth<BR>leaders&quot;, a heinous crime&quot;, &quot;a judicial murder&quot;, &quot;a travesty of<BR>justice&quot;, and Nigeria itself described as &quot;international peril&quot;,<BR>among other strong words from world leaders. Human rights groups<BR>called the murder charge &quot;an affront&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Nigerian Foreign Minister, Prof Bolaji Akinyomi, termed<BR>the whole affair, &quot;a jungle trial, state murder and state<BR>terrorism.&quot; He added that the trial was unfair. &quot;The World must<BR>put a stop to this mindless group of people and their<BR>collaborators,&quot; he told the British Broadcasting Corporation<BR>(BBC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After having been snubbed as a result of his soft approach and<BR>seeing the long, dark shadow the entire event cast over the<BR>Commonwealth meeting, Mandela came back strongly to placate his<BR>critics by recommending the suspension of Nigeria from the body was subsequently suspended and given two years to reform or face<BR>a move supported by British Prime Minister, John Major. Nigeria<BR>expulsion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, the reaction from around the world to the killings<BR>mainly on the diplomatic front, has been resounding, with many<BR>countries recalling their envoys from Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest measures against Nigeria, however belated, would<BR>probably put pressure on the Abacha regime to release the<BR>remaining political prisoners, including the Chief Moshood Abiola,<BR>presumed winner of the annuled June 1993 election. Without total<BR>isolation and economic blockade, however, desired results are<BR>unlikely to happen for the foreseeable future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Saro-Wiwa and his associates will go down, not only as<BR>martyrs of minority rights campaign, but also of environmental<BR>protection in this decade.<BR>-0United States and Africa</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The collective efforts of parishioners in Nairobi's<BR>Eastlands Deanery has resulted in an excellent institution of<BR>creative arts. The centre has tapped previously unexploited talent<BR>among Kenya's young men and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The brainchild of Maryknoll missionary Father Tom Burke in the<BR>late 80s the Buru Buru Institute of Fine Arts (BIFA) became the<BR>initiative of the development committee of the Blessed Sacrament<BR>Church Buru Buru, a middle income level residential area in th e<BR>Kenyan capital, Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It took the committee many hours of deliberations before<BR>determining the direction BIFA should take. Construction began in<BR>September 1991 on a piece of land donated by the government next<BR>to the church.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Archbishop of Nairobi Maurice Cardinal Otunga who is also<BR>head of the Catholic Church in Kenya was the chief guest at BIFA's<BR>first graduation ceremony on September 15 , 1995. During this<BR>occasion, when 51 students received their well deserved diplomas<BR>after a two year course, the Archbishop was visibly delighted by<BR>the progress made by the college in slightly more than two years<BR>of existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BIFA admits young men and women regardless of their religious<BR>affiliation. Students then pursue a career in art either by being<BR>employed or as self- employed persons but the curriculum is<BR>strongly tipped towards self-reliance and self- motivation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The emphasis on self-reliance is deliberate because Nairobi's<BR>Eastlands Deanery is home to countless of idle school leavers who<BR>cannot find work. A growing number of young people who cannot be<BR>absorbed by the ever narrowing private and public job market all<BR>over Kenya are turning to drugs, prostitution and violence. The<BR>situation can only get worse as the job market dwindles. Fr. Burke<BR>is convinced that many youth turn to alcoholism and violence to<BR>vent frustration arising from a feeling of worthlessness. BIFA<BR>therefore underscores the need for young people to gain selfMr. J. Gitau, chairman of the Buru Buru Parish Council and the<BR>confidence and be self-supporting.<BR>BIFA Management Committee recalls the various methods used to<BR>raise money to put up the institute; - chains of coins around the<BR>church, luncheons, sales of calendars and roast meat as well as<BR>&quot;harambees&quot;. The later Kiswahili word means pooling resources<BR>towards a funds raising venture. It is based on community spirit<BR>and everybody voluntarily chips in what ever (mainly) monetary or<BR>other contribution towards the programme. &quot;The response of the<BR>parishioners was overwhelming and we began to see the project as a<BR>reality by 1990,&quot; adds Gitau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through &quot;harambee&quot; the community of Buru Buru alone raised<BR>shillings 3.6 million (more than US dollars 65,000) while<BR>shillings 5.4 million (about US dollars 98,000) was received in<BR>form of gifts and donations from well wishers in Kenya and abroad.<BR>The money was used to put up the institute and equip it with<BR>furniture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BIFA's curriculum which was drawn up by competent art teachers<BR>in the country compares favorably with that in advanced colleges.<BR>The chairman of BIFA's Academic Board, Mr. John Kariru who is also<BR>a senior lecturer in the Department of Art at one of the state<BR>universities, Kenyatta University, says; &quot;It is a dynamic<BR>curriculum that is constantly evaluated and monitored to see where<BR>it can be improved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kariru designed the vestment with African motifs worn by Pope<BR>John Paul II and the Bishops during the papal mass in Nairobi,<BR>Kenya mid-September this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believes institutions like BIFA will help encourage the<BR>formation of authentic art in Kenya. He argues that local art has<BR>been corrupted and quality sacrificed to foreign standards and the<BR>commercialism of curio shops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Commercial galleries are mainly concerned with monetary<BR>returns at the expense of authenticity and creativity,&quot; laments<BR>Kariru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tobias Butama, the Principal of BIFA, who also teaches art at<BR>the institute says his job is &quot;very fulfilling&quot; because one<BR>participates in the blooming of young talent. &quot;It is also<BR>gratifying because our students understand what to do with their<BR>talents. Many earn commissions which we encourage while still at<BR>BIFA,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The principal is assisted by a team of competent lecturers. A<BR>lot of emphasis is put on developing a wholesome individual. &quot;The<BR>artist must be a good citizen too. Being creative and talented is<BR>not all there is in life,&quot; remarks Butama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To help mould the character of their students, BIFA invites<BR>many professionals including counsellors to speak on various<BR>subjects ranging from the power of prayer to copyright law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BIFA's main courses are drawing, painting ceramics, sculpture,<BR>textile design, graphics and history of art. Students pay an<BR>annual fee of KShs. 25,000 (US dollars 450).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The school currently has about 130 students, 30 per cent of<BR>whom are young women pursuing the two-year course. &quot;I suppose the<BR>girls are still finding their way,&quot; quipped Cardinal Otunga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To encourage more female participants, Butama hopes to extend<BR>the curriculum to include subjects like interior and fashion<BR>design as well as computer graphics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BIFA's third phase will take a few more years to develop. This<BR>will involve teaching the performing arts, dance, mime, and ballet<BR>among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An aspiring entrepreneur, Jennifer Macharia, a second year<BR>student at BIFA has a lot of praise for the institution; &quot;One's<BR>talent is nurtured because the teachers allow you the freedom to<BR>explore,&quot; she told APS.<BR>-0Nigeria</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The United Nations has indicted Sudan of &quot;grave and<BR>widespread&quot; human rights violations, including killings,<BR>kidnappings, slavery and religious persecutions, as an armed<BR>conflict looms in the region between Sudanese government and its<BR>neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations has warned that Sudan was the site of<BR>&quot;grave and widespread&quot; human rights violations, which included<BR>among other abuses murders and kidnappings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 28-page report was compiled after a fact-finding mission to<BR>neighbouring Eritrea, Kenya and Uganda. However, the mission was<BR>refused entry into Sudan. Released at the UN headquarters in New<BR>York on November 6, the report quotes UN Special investigator<BR>Gaspar Biro saying, &quot;grave and widespread violations of human<BR>rights by government agents, as well as abuses by members of rebel<BR>parties to the conflict in southern Sudan, other than the<BR>government of Sudan, continued to take place in the zones<BR>controlled by them.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his findings, Biro says the violations included &quot;extraabductions, slavery, systematic torture and widespread arbitrary<BR>judicial killings, enforced or involuntary disappearances,<BR>arrests of suspected political opponents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The document denounces the &quot;passivity of the government of<BR>Sudan regarding the cases of slavery, servitude, slave trade,<BR>including the abduction of women and children, traffic in and sale<BR>of children, forced labour and similar institutions and practices<BR>brought to its attention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN report estimates that some 1.2 million people have died<BR>in Sudan since civil war erupted in the southern part of the<BR>northeast African nation in 1983, between government forces and<BR>the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) seeking to end<BR>domination of the mainly Christian and animist south by the<BR>Arabised, Muslim north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sudan is divided into three main groups, northerners,<BR>southerners and westerners, with the north being predominantly<BR>Muslim, while the south follows traditional and Christian faiths.<BR>Religious issues, coupled with strains over whether the country<BR>should be associated with North Africa or sub-Saharan Africa, have<BR>fueled the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;During the past five years thousands of civilians are reported<BR>to have been killed in deliberate and indiscriminate attacks,<BR>including aerial bombardments on civilian targets by government<BR>forces,&quot; the UN report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Nuba Mountains, notes the report, &quot;a large number of<BR>civilians, including women and children, Muslims and Christians<BR>alike, have been killed in these attacks or summarily executed.<BR>Others are reported to have lost their lives as a result of brutal<BR>torture in secret detention centres run by the security organs or<BR>in military barracks, and dozens of army officers have been<BR>summarily executed after secret trials by special courts,&quot; writes<BR>Biro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The investigator says he confirmed previous reports of<BR>prisoners of war abuses, where &quot;those captured have been and are<BR>being tortured and summarily executed. If a prisoner is captured<BR>and he refuses to change sides, he is cruelly tortured and<BR>executed,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Biro notes in the document that other participants in the<BR>conflict besides the government are responsible for abuses in the<BR>zones they control, and denounced &quot;dissident commanders, mainly<BR>those who had split in recent years from the South Sudan<BR>Independence Movement/Army (SSIM/A), formed last year by former<BR>SPLA deputy leader Riek Machar. The SPLA &quot;bears responsibility for<BR>the violations and atrocities committed in 1995 by local<BR>commanders from its own ranks,&quot; reports the UN findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports from the Nuba region also indicated an escalation of<BR>atrocities, with hundreds of kidnappings, defacing of mosques,<BR>destruction of churches and several attacks on local religious<BR>leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;During 1995, hundreds of political opponents or people merely<BR>suspected of being potential opponents to the regime have been<BR>arrested and held in detention for days, weeks or even months<BR>without warrant or any concrete charges,&quot; the UN document says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN report comes in the wake of major gains by John Garang's<BR>mainstream SPLA rebels and looming tensions between the countries<BR>of the entire Eastern African region, threatening to erupt into<BR>political upheavals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan accuses Uganda of aiding the SPLA rebels, whose leader is<BR>a personal friend of President Yoweri Museveni while Uganda<BR>accuses Khartoum of aiding Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels<BR>currently waging a guerrilla war against Kampala in the northern<BR>and northwestern Ugandan regions bordering Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia has been drawn into the conflict due to Sudan's<BR>turbulent relations with Egypt over Khartoum's alleged harbouring<BR>and training of Islamic militants seeking to overt hrow Egypt's<BR>secular regime and replace it with a fundamentalist one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia blamed Khartoum-based Muslim militants for the attempt<BR>to assassinate President Hosni Mubarak during the Organisation of<BR>African Unity (OAU) summit in Addis Ababa last June, bringing<BR>relations between Egypt and Sudan, and Ethiopia and Sudan to an<BR>all-time low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year the Sudanese junta dismissed as &quot;mistaken&quot; Eritrean<BR>accusations that it was training 700 terrorists to topple the<BR>government in Asmara. Asmara severed diplomatic relations with<BR>Sudan on December 6, 1994 accusing the Khartoum government of<BR>seeking to destabilise the Eritrean government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya and Uganda have also been at loggerheads in recent months<BR>over accusations that Uganda was preparing to attack Kenya with<BR>the help of South African mercenaries. Uganda has since counterexiles.  Nairobi has also dismissed reports by Ugandan governmentowned daily, New Vision, to the effect that Kenya was massing<BR>accused Kenya of preparing a similar plot with the help of Ugandan<BR>troops at the common border in Western Kenya in readiness for a<BR>rebel attack against Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A follow-up visit by Kenyan journalists to the border town of<BR>Malaba on November 12 turned sour when they were arrested and<BR>later released by Ugandan police. The journalists were said to be<BR>part of a larger contingent that travelled to the border to verify<BR>whether or not Kenya was preparing to attack her neighbour in the<BR>west. And upon his return from the Commonwealth Heads of State<BR>Summit in Auckland New Zealand, President Moi on November 14<BR>castigated local journalists for betraying Kenya by writing<BR>outrageous things about their country. &quot;I am glad the journalists<BR>were arrested in Uganda the country they have been pressing all<BR>along,&quot; said Moi, reacting to the arrest of his country's<BR>journalists at the border town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rwandan ethnic genocide has played into the Ugandan-Kenyan<BR>rivalry, with suspicions that Uganda might have been involved in<BR>the death in a plane crash of Hutu presidents of Rwanda and<BR>Burundi on April 6 last year, which sparked massacres that left<BR>between 500,000 and one million people dead, most of them minority<BR>Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni is a close ally of Rwandan strongman General Paul<BR>Kagame whose minority Tutsi-backed Rwandan Patriotic Front/Army<BR>(RPF/A) swept to power in July last year after defeating the<BR>majority Hutu regime of President Juvenal Habyarimana, a close<BR>friend of Kenyan President Moi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tanzania has also warned that it would fight back deep in<BR>Burundi if the Burundi an army carried out a threat to cross into<BR>Tanzania to pursue armed Hutu living in Tanzania. Tension deepened<BR>mid-November when Sudan suddenly accused Uganda, Eritrea and<BR>Tanzania of fighting alongside the SPLA rebels, claims that were<BR>immediately denied by both Asmara and Dar es Salaam, as well as<BR>the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudanese Head of State, Lt.-General Omar Hassan al-Beshir,<BR>aggravated the situation when he declared a general mobilization,<BR>and threatened to send troops into Uganda in revenge for the<BR>latter's backing of southern Sudanese rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All youth are asked to proceed to army training camps. The<BR>arms that have plowed the earth and grow the wheat are now<BR>demanded to take up the Kalashnikov,&quot; Beshir said in a fiery<BR>speech at a rally broadcast by Sudanese state radio, and accused<BR>Uganda of having sent a division of troops and tanks across the<BR>border to back southern rebels in a new offensive that began midVowing not only to &quot;cleanse the soil of south Sudan&quot; of the<BR>November.<BR>Ugandan troops, but to strike back into Ugandan territory, General<BR>el-Beshir declared: &quot;We shall not content ourselves with repulsing<BR>the invading forces, but will repay the visit. We are not Christ,<BR>turning the other cheek for another slap.&quot; We will deal a double<BR>blow and will avenge our faith, honour and dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the man believed to be at the centre of the regional<BR>conflict has remained as calm as ever, telling the Sudanese leader<BR>that he was not worried about his threat to invade Uganda. Denying<BR>Uganda's involvement in the Sudanese conflict, Museveni said: &quot;If<BR>the Su danese president wants to attack Uganda, he is welcome. We<BR>have been proposing to these people that Sudan should be run as<BR>secular state and a modern country, some do not accept. But when<BR>some section of their people refuse and decide to fight, then they<BR>blame Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have fought many wars and I am, therefore not worried about<BR>the threat, &quot; Museveni said on November 6 in reference to the<BR>five-year guerrilla bush war he fought against successive Ugandan<BR>military regimes before he seized power in January 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the SPLA believes that Khartoum's tongue-lashing against<BR>neighbours could only come as a result of new developments in the<BR>warfront, where reports say the rebels had regained the initiative<BR>and made major gains that currently threaten the southern regional<BR>capital, Juba.<BR>-0Kenya</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - A major research project on Christian communication<BR>in Africa was launched here on November 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dubbed Media Link 2000, the research is being undertaken by the<BR>pan-Africanist Fellowship of Christian Communicators in Africa and<BR>Madagascar (FOCCAM), based here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing media practitioners and representatives of various<BR>Christian organisations at a dinner organised here to mark the<BR>official launching of the research project, FOCCAM General<BR>Secretary Rev. Dr. Stephen Njiro, said; &quot;We intend to help the<BR>church in Africa get to know who is who and what is available in<BR>Christian communication on the continent.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the research aims to institute a databank on Christian<BR>communication in Africa. &quot;We intend to effectively tell the<BR>churches in Africa how many Christian communicators there are on<BR>the continent, what they are currently engaged in, the available<BR>training facilities on the continent, the number of printing<BR>presses, periodicals (newspapers/magazines), publishers/editors;<BR>and radio stations, where they exist,&quot; added Dr. Njiro, a Kenya<BR>trained theologian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We seem to be living in the world of massive duplication,<BR>isolation and lack of networking among trained Christian<BR>communicators, which we hope the research undertaken will<BR>effectively help to clarify,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phase One of the project will involve the sending out of<BR>questionnaires and making visits to some African countries in the<BR>regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To facilitate the research FOCCAM intends to collaborate with<BR>major Christian organisations in Africa, among them the<BR>Association of Evangelicals in Africa (AEA), the All Africa<BR>Conference of Churches (AACC) and the Catholic Symposium of<BR>Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar (SECAM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked about the significance of Media Link 2000 in relation to<BR>the research, Dr. Njiro said, &quot;it is simply because we want to<BR>limit ourselves to the period between now and the year 2000 and<BR>also towards helping the churches see the challenges ahead of<BR>their Christian communication ministry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the idea of a research project was mooted in 1993,<BR>during the 1st General Assembly of FOCCAM, in Harare, Zimbabwe,<BR>where delegates deliberated on the theme- &quot;Communication<BR>Strategies for Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the dinner quests on the subject, Abundant Life For<BR>All, Kenyan career diplomat, Mr. Bethuel Kiplagat commended FOCCAM<BR>for the research project and noted that as Christians, &quot;we should<BR>feel duty bound to support it morally and financially.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Kiplagat lamented that although God expects everyone to<BR>have life and have it abundantly as the Bible teaches civil<BR>strife, famine, corruption, and mismanagement worked against such<BR>intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Kiplagat, a former Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of<BR>Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation, cautioned Africans<BR>against spending too much time talking about the good old days,<BR>and challenged people to forge ahead and build a better future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What counts is where we are now and where we are moving to. We<BR>have to be future oriented rather than being fixed on the past,&quot;<BR>he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Established in 1984, FOCCAM, seeks to unite Christian<BR>communicators throughout Africa and Madagascar for mutual<BR>fellowship, encouragement, assistance and the sharing of t he<BR>gospel. It currently has some 400 members who include individuals<BR>and Christian organisations.<BR>-0Sudan</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banjul, Gambia - Church refugee workers and administrators in<BR>Central and West Africa have proposed the formation of a regional<BR>steering committee to promote the church ministry among uprooted<BR>people in the affected regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 40 participants at the October 23-25 regional meeting,<BR>organised by the Refugee and Emergency Services Unit of the All<BR>Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) also recommended that<BR>churches immediately begin the process of sensitization on issu es<BR>pertaining to the uprooted people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting also called on the formation and promotion of<BR>diversified church programmes in healing and reconciliation aimed<BR>at resolving issues related to conflict prevention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The participants also accepted in principal the on-going<BR>process towards the decentralisation of the AACC Refugee and<BR>Emergency Services. The meeting was chaired by the vice-chairman<BR>of the Refugee and Emergency Services Committee, Bishop Johnson<BR>Tilewa of the Gambia Anglican Diocese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regional meeting recommended that churches identify a group<BR>of eminent persons, to be sent to talk to the Zairean authorities<BR>on the recent decision to have all Rwandese refugees leave the<BR>country by December 31 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were also unanimous on a decision to identify a group of<BR>eminent persons to talk to the Tanzanian authorities in regard to<BR>the latter's decision to close its borders to Burundian refugees,<BR>seeking political asylum in the East African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting also adopted a decision by the World Council of<BR>Churches (WCC) at its Central Committee meeting last September to<BR>make 1997 the Ecumenical Year for churches in solidarity with<BR>uprooted people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WCC policy document entitled, A Moment to Choose: Risking<BR>to be with uprooted people, was presented at the Banjul meeting by<BR>Mr. Malaku Kifle the coordinator for the Refugees and Migrant Unit<BR>of WCC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Banjul meeting requested churches in the affected regions,<BR>namely Central and West Africa, that make concrete and firm plans<BR>for a &quot;Week of Confession&quot; as a precursor of a concrete plan of<BR>action towards ministering to the uprooted people all over the<BR>world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A document presented at the meeting proposed the third week of<BR>June, 1996 as a suitable time for the &quot;Week of Confession&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>All Africa Press Service<BR>November 20, 1995 (19951120)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) has<BR>denied reports of massive lay-offs of its employees in a<BR>restructuring process as reported by a section of the local press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesperson for the NCCK General Secretary Rev. Mutava<BR>Musyimi also dismissed as &quot;untrue and pure exaggeration&quot;<BR>allegations that the council would &quot;sack&quot; 1,000 staff at a cost of<BR>shillings 500 million (US dollars 9 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;NCCK NOW SACKS 1,000 EMPLOYEES,&quot; was the headline of the lead<BR>story in the November 5 Sunday edition of a daily here. The Sunday<BR>edition reported that as a result of the re-organization, all<BR>current staff at the NCCK with the exception of the General<BR>Secretary Rev. Mutava Musyimi and his deputy Rev. George Kamwesa,<BR>are to be laid off by the end of the month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Expressing distaste at such distorted reports the NCCK<BR>spokesperson said, contrary to the newspaper story, the council<BR>currently has 400 staff members all over the country, thus there<BR>was no way it could be sacking 1,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> True, the spokesperson said, a well-coordinated restructuring<BR>programme was in progress as a result of financial difficulties<BR>which in any case are not exceptional to NCCK, but no employee had<BR>been &quot;sacked&quot; as the newspaper suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spokesperson said employees have been requested to apply<BR>for voluntary retirement and a handsome package has been offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About the KShs.500 million said to be the cost NCCK will incur<BR>as compensation for the retirees, the spokesperson told APS that<BR>this figure was highly exaggerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NCCK, which is an &quot;association of churches and other<BR>Christian organizations guided by scripture, empowered by the<BR>spirit and informed by tradition, sharing and acting together in<BR>the experience and extension of the Kingdom of God&quot;, was<BR>established some 52 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, its history dates to as far back as 1918 when the<BR>Church Missionary Society (CMS) United Methodist Mission, and the<BR>Church of Scotland - (Presbyterian) formed the Alliance of<BR>Protestant Missions (APM) &quot;with the aim of founding a united<BR>Christian church in Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1924 the Alliance of Protestant Missions formed Kenya<BR>Missionary Council (KMC) &quot;to facilitate activities of all<BR>Protestant missions in Kenya.&quot; The KMC became the Christian<BR>Council of Kenya (CCK) in 1943.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1957 the Christian Council of Kenya launched its first<BR>Christian newspaper, Rock, which was to be replaced by<BR>Target/Lengo in 1961. The NCCK became the National Christian<BR>Council of Kenya (NCCK) in 1966 which later translated to the<BR>National Council of Churches of Kenya in 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Council of Churches of Kenya programmes include<BR>education, economic development, ecumenical outreach and the fight<BR>for social justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the quest for these ideals, particularly for social justice,<BR>the council has often rubbed the Kenyan government the wrong way<BR>up. When Beyond, an NCCK publication, protested against what it<BR>referred to as massive rigging in the 1988 general elections it<BR>was promptly banned by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then during the 1992 general election the NCCK launched what it<BR>called &quot;Education for Participatory Democracy&quot; in form of a<BR>booklet entitled: Why You Should Vote. This was meant to inform<BR>Kenyans about their rights as voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NCCK sank even deeper into the government's &quot;bad books&quot;<BR>when it set up a task force to investigate the &quot;ethnic clashes&quot;<BR>that plunged Kenya between late 1991 through 1993. The<BR>relationship worsened when the council published its findings in a<BR>report called, The Cursed Arrow - (A report on Organized Violence<BR>Against Democracy in Kenya) which implicated the Kenyan government<BR>in the investigation and fueling of the clashes.<BR>-0Gambia</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reducing of troops as a prelude to merging them into a single<BR>national army was a key aspect of the Lusaka accord signed between<BR>UNITA and MPLA in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, in November 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resumption of talks here on November 14 will definitely<BR>please the leaders of Angola Christian Churches (EDICA), who met<BR>in Luanda early September under the theme, &quot; It is time to build<BR>Angola&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the conclusion of the church meeting, the delegates sent a<BR>special appeal to UNITA and the government to accelerate the peace<BR>process under the Lusaka agreement, &quot;in order to reduce the<BR>suffering of the great majority of Angolan peoples.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The leaders also appealed to the representatives of the United<BR>Nations peacekeeping force in Angola, UNAVEM-III, the political<BR>parties, the NGOs &quot;and the whole society in general to do their<BR>utmost best in order to win peace, social justice and love among<BR>the people of Angola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EDICA recommended also that reconciliation should be total &quot;and<BR>a priority task&quot; between individuals and between man and his maker<BR>&quot;putting into practice order of our Lord Jesus Christ as the basis<BR>for this reconciliation and building of peace in the nation. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A special appeal was made to Angolan people to the power of<BR>prayer &quot;starting with the leadership itself and all church<BR>members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Angolan churches also called for an ecumenical trust<BR>between diverse faiths of the Christian family saying, &quot;true<BR>confession, forgiveness tolerance and acceptance of the churches<BR>amongst each other must be encouraged and prioritised for a real<BR>and peaceful living together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EDICA urged the churches to lay emphasis &quot;on those things that<BR>unite rather than divide.&quot; The meeting was organised by the<BR>Evangelical Churches of Angola(AEA), and the Angolan Council of<BR>Christian Churches (CICA).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dar es Salaam - A 10-party opposition alliance to boycott a<BR>partial re-run of the historic parliamentary elections scheduled<BR>in the Dar es Salaam region on November 26 has collapsed after<BR>several parties decided to participate after all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ballot re-run in Dar es Salam's seven constituencies came<BR>after the Tanzanian High Court earlier last week dismissed with<BR>costs a legal bid by the 10 parties to have the entire election<BR>annulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition parties claim elections to the presidency and the<BR>parliament in the first multi-party polls in Tanzania's history,<BR>held concurrently on October 29, were rigged.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Election officials cancelled the results in the capital on<BR>October 30 after admitting widespread irregularities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, seven opposition groups have now decided to<BR>participate in the fresh ballot, leaving only the National<BR>Convention for Construction and Reform (NCCR-Mageuzi), the Civic<BR>United Front (CUF) and the United Democratic Party (UDP) still<BR>vowing to snub the poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now taking part are: the Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo<BR>(CHADEMA) - Party for Democracy and Progress), the National<BR>Reconstruction Alliance (NRA), the National League for Democracy<BR>(NLD), the Union for Multiparty Democracy (UMD), the Popular Natio<BR>nal Party (PONA), the United People's Democratic Party (UDPD) and<BR>the Tanzania Democ ratic Alliance (TADEA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Electoral Commission chairman Justice Lewis Makame has however,<BR>ruled any party boycotting the parliamentary poll will be struck<BR>off lists for the presidential poll, held at the same time as the<BR>ballot for the 232-seat legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exclusion from the poll of the NCCR-Mageuzi, CUF and UDP<BR>would automatically leave the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCMcandidate.<BR>Revolutionary Party) candidate Benjamin Mkapa as sole presidential</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three opposition candidates for the presidency were<BR>Augustine Mrema for NCCR - Mageuzi, Ibrahim Lipumba for the CUF<BR>and John Cheyo for the UDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to results published so far, the CCM has crushed the<BR>12 opposition parties that contested the first multi-party<BR>parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Delivering its verdict on November 13, a three-judge High Court<BR>panel said the petitioners had failed to give sufficient evidence<BR>to prove that the presidential and parliamentary elections were<BR>not fair and free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judges said the opposition had also failed to prove that<BR>the polling repeat in Dar es Salaam, which they also wanted<BR>cancelled, would adversely affect the electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also ordered the complainants to meet the costs of the<BR>case, and rejected a demand that the electoral commission be<BR>barred from announcing the results of the presidential poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court ruling brought an outpouring of anger from opposition<BR>supporters gathered around the building, with demonstrators<BR>throwing stones and chanting slogans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A crowd of opposition supporters surged forward in an attempt<BR>to storm the court immediately after the ruling, but they were<BR>stopped by riot policemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They later took to the streets, stoning cars and chanting<BR>slogans against the court and the ruling party. Shopkeepers closed<BR>their shutters, fearing possible looting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luanda - Angolan churches have proposed the establishment of a<BR>frequency modulation (FM) radio station and a newspaper to serve<BR>the church exclusively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the conference of Christian Churches of Angola (EDICA)<BR>here last September under the theme, &quot;It is time to build Angola&quot;,<BR>church leaders noted that communication is one of the principal<BR>capacities of any individual and the mission of the church is<BR>carried out essentially by communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church leaders recommended that the Angolan government make<BR>a survey of the programmes developed by its organs of<BR>communication namely, Radio Angola, the government press agency<BR>(ANGOP) and national television station, with the intention of<BR>presenting information which upgrades the population and the<BR>nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EDICA also recommended that the council of Evangelicals of<BR>Angola (AEA) and the Council of Christian Churches in Angola<BR>(CICA) jointly with the government, establish a permanent<BR>commission to reform the law into a form that sustains press<BR>freedom and abolishes censorship in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition they said the means of social communications be desocial problems of interest and impact to the population.<BR>linked from politics entirely so as to give equal importance to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile a de-mining project by the Norwegian Peoples Aid is<BR>making slow but sure progress in clearing land mines on arable<BR>land around the city of Malanje in north central Angola, according<BR>to a report by Jim Kirkwood of the Canadian Council of ChurchesThe land is very suitable for cultivation but has been unused<BR>affiliated Inter-Church Coalition on Africa (ICCA).<BR>since a land mine blew up there last year. &quot;It is an incredibly<BR>slow process; a team of two persons clears about 90 metres long by<BR>one metre wide a day, by cutting grass down to half an inch and<BR>going over the dirt with a metal detector less than two feet<BR>long,&quot; Kirkwood, who visited Angola recently, told APS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And if the search party should detect anything they must dig<BR>around it with a trowel to determine its size and then only, do<BR>they report it to the specialists who defuse it. So far Norwegian<BR>Peoples Aid have been lucky and have not lost a single person in<BR>those operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kirkwood reports that there was celebration when the road from<BR>Malanje to the capital, Luanda was opened, through territory<BR>formerly held by the opposition Union for the Total Independence<BR>of Angola (UNITA). &quot;Discussions were starting on extending the<BR>road eastwards towards Saurimo in Luanda North provinces, for<BR>which a number of bridges destroyed during the war have to be<BR>rebuilt,&quot; noted Kirkwood.<BR>-0Tanzania</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Auckland - Mozambique, a former Portuguese colony and the<BR>largely French-speaking Cameroon officially joined the<BR>Commonwealth Club, which theoretically links Britain with former<BR>chunks of its empire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During its summit in the New Zealand capital, Auckland, the<BR>Club agreed to &quot;warmly welcome&quot; Mozambique as a &quot;unique and<BR>special case,&quot; New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger told a press<BR>conference here on November 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique's admission was agreed upon during the Commonwealth<BR>leaders' weekend retreat at the Millbrook resort in South Island,<BR>Bolger said, noting that this southern African country was<BR>surrounded by Commonwealth nations - including South Africa,<BR>Zimbabwe and Tanzania - and had expressed a strong desire to be<BR>part of the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two days before the Commonwealth summit opened, the rulingManuel Tome had stressed in the Mozambican capital, Maputo that it<BR>Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) Secretary-General<BR>was a question of survival that Mozambique must join the<BR>Commonwealth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We live in a highly dependent world and we want to have the<BR>widest options possible... joining the Commonwealth is justified<BR>by the economic and development interests of our country,&quot; Tome<BR>said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A very dependent country like ours does not want to become<BR>more dependent through exclusivity. Almost 60 per cent of the<BR>state budget is financed by international creditors and that is<BR>not healthy,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambican President Joachim Chissano lamented last July that<BR>of the 12 members of the Southern African Development Community<BR>(SADC), only his country and Angola were not Commonwealth members,<BR>and said; &quot;If we are welcome, we will join.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We can only see advantages for our country from joining the<BR>Commonwealth. We would not join such an organisation if the<BR>condition was that we have to give up speaking Portuguese. As far<BR>as language is concerned, we will keep fighting for Portuguese,&quot;<BR>Chissano stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique's claim to linkage with the Commonwealth of EnglishAlthough it was Portugal that eventually set up colonial<BR>speaking countries has roots in its history and recent past.<BR>administration in Mozambique, Britain helped build its major ports<BR>and railways, to serve the neighbouring hinterland British<BR>colonies and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the late 19th century, British-owned companies administered<BR>much of central Mozambique, where the British pound once<BR>circulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique's close relationship with the Commonwealth as an<BR>observer nation also has much to do with the recent political<BR>history of the southern Africa region. The country's first<BR>independence leader Samora Machel, played a key role in the<BR>Lancaster House negotiations which brought about the independence<BR>of neighbouring Zimbabwe, formerly southern Rhodesia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique was the founding member of the Frontline States and<BR>the Southern Africa Development and Coordination Conference<BR>(SADCC) now SADC, two regional political and economic<BR>organisations which challenged apartheid in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a victim of aggressive apartheid policies since 1987,<BR>Mozambique received Commonwealth aid mainly directed to<BR>infrastructure linking Mozambique and its Commonwealth neighbours.<BR>The Auckland Summit also saw the formal return of South Africa to<BR>the Commonwealth more than 30 years after the former whiteapartheid.<BR>minority Pretoria regime quit because of Commonwealth criticism of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cameroon, on the other hand, became the 52nd member state of<BR>the Commonwealth early in November, ending a policy of neutrality<BR>followed since independence in 1960 and reawakening secessionist<BR>leanings in some sectors of its two English-speaking provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the first 30 years, the government in Yaounde had kept its<BR>distance from such groupings, and unlike the former French<BR>colonies in Africa, it has declined to join the francophone<BR>community set up by General Charles de Gaulle when he was<BR>president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in 1990, policy was switched to seek Commonwealth<BR>membership in a bid to win aid and to pacify critics in the<BR>English-speaking community who said the country was too close to<BR>French institutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Algiers - Two gunmen shot dead a French Roman Catholic nun on<BR>November 10 and seriously wounded another in a fresh attack on<BR>foreigners, six days ahead of presidential elections in strifeThe dead nun was identified by authoritative sources in Paris<BR>torn Algeria, security officials said.<BR>as Odette Prevost, 63, while the other, Chantal Galicher, 53, was<BR>hospitalised in serious condition in intensive care, church<BR>sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Algiers Archbishop Monsignor Henri Teissier went to the<BR>hospital to see Galicher the same day the nuns were shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two women, from the congregation of the Little Sisters of<BR>the Sacred Heart, were shot outside their home in Kouba district,<BR>a working-class area of central Algiers where Islamic<BR>fundamentalists opposed to the country's military-backed<BR>government are very active.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Algerian government condemned the &quot;odious attack aimed at<BR>guests of Algeria&quot; and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Paris, French government spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt<BR>described the attack on the nuns as an &quot;unqualifiable act of<BR>barbarism&quot; and an &quot;odious act,&quot; adding that &quot;security of French<BR>nationals in Algeria is a responsibility incumbent on the Algerian<BR>authorities... an inquiry must be carried out as quickly as<BR>possible to establish who was to blame .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The French Foreign Ministry urged French citizens in Algeria to<BR>return to France, and for French citizens, especially journalists,<BR>to refrain from going to Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nun's death brought to 11 the number of Christian clerics<BR>-- seven French, two Spanish, one Maltese and one Belgian - killed<BR>in Algeria since May 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 100 foreigners, including 31 French, have been killed<BR>in Algeria since September 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials in France - the former colonial power had feared<BR>attacks on foreigners in Algeria ahead of the election, especially<BR>after a series of terrorist bombings in France that have left<BR>seven dead since July. French citizens last month were urged to<BR>leave, and the Foreign Ministry urged French journalists not to go<BR>to cover the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About 1,000 French nationals remain in Algeria, most of them<BR>elderly and clerics. There are also about 1,000 temporary oil and<BR>gas workers in Algeria but they are heavily protected by the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest attack came on the Muslim prayer day for the week<BR>and also one day ahead of the beginning of absentee vowing for<BR>Algerians in France, which took place on November 11, 12 and 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Algerian head of government Mokdad Sifi called on the same day<BR>of the attack for a &quot;massive-turnout&quot; among overseas Algerians in<BR>order to &quot;put an end to the tragedy. Your votes count enormously,&quot;<BR>Sifi said over state radio. A total of 730,000 absentee voters are<BR>registered, including more than 600,000 in France, according to<BR>Algerian television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Algeria's 16 million voters cast their ballots on November 16<BR>in the first presidential poll in the civil war that has cost<BR>between 30,000 to 50,000 lives since 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition parties allied to the banned Islamic Salvation<BR>Front (FIS) boycotted what they deride as a rigged election<BR>designed to legitimise incumbent President Lamine Zeroual, who at<BR>a rally on November 9 urged Algerians to unite against &quot;bloody<BR>terrorism.&quot; Some are predicting the elections will plunge the<BR>country into full-scale civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armed movements had vowed that &quot;the ballot boxes would turn<BR>into coffins,&quot; but so far their threats had failed to stop the<BR>candidates from holding meetings, and the more fearsome episodes<BR>of bloodletting had been limited in number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zeroual, 54, a retired general, is generally viewed as the<BR>front-runner ahead of Islamic candidate Mahfoud Nahnah who<BR>advocates a &quot;tolerant and modern&quot; form of Islam. The crisis in<BR>Algeria began in January 1992 when President Chadli Bendjedid was<BR>forced by military hardliners to resign. The first round of a<BR>general election the FIS was poised to win had just been annulled.<BR>-0Mozambique and Cameroon</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Confusion marked the end of the first leg of the third<BR>national basketball championship games in Ndola at the weekend at<BR>which five teams qualified to the next stage of the competition to<BR>be held in Lusaka on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First it was the local side Bank of Zambia Celtic who reported<BR>one and half hours late during the first day of the two day event<BR>claiming they had been delayed because they were having breakfast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commissioner Frank Saliki was stunned by the explanation and<BR>kept wondering how a Ndola-based team could afford to be late for<BR>a fixture in their home town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Teams from Lusaka have managed to arrive on time but I cannot<BR>understand how a home team can report late especially because they<BR>were having breakfast,&quot; Saliki of Luanshya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Celtic were fined for the delay and the game finally took off.<BR>Second, a match commissioner caused a scene when he was barred<BR>from officiating a game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Basketball Association (ZBA) Northern Zone regional<BR>coordinator Augustine Simonda threatened to disrupt the games for<BR>not being allowed to officiate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Simonda who plays for Kitwe's Premium Baskets demanded that he<BR>officiate the game between Premium Hawks and BOZ Celtics but Hawks<BR>protested, arguing that he was an interested party as his team had<BR>lost 67-68 to them and he had been sent off after commiting the<BR>mandatory five personal fouls. His behaviour upset Lusaka City<BR>Council (LCC) Looters secretary Richard Simakomo who called the<BR>act as &quot; childish&quot; and suggested that something be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The game finally took place after Simonda released the ball<BR>following intervention by ZBA deputy national coordinator,<BR>Boniface Kambi-kambi. Only Mufulira Magnet failed to qualify from<BR>the six teams that had entered the competition whose next round<BR>would be in Lusaka this weekend.<BR>-0Zambia</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - South African tennis players have dominated the<BR>seedings of the International Tennis Federation Central Africa<BR>Men's Satellite with six being ranked among the top eight players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to information released by the ITF supervisor, Lugi<BR>Brambilla, who is overseeing the tournament, South African Yonass<BR>Saayman is the top seeded player after collecting 42 points since<BR>the tournament kicked off in South Africa three weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from the six South African players, other players seeded<BR>are Balducui, who is seeded second and last seed Bazzics, both<BR>from Italy .

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Lugi, the ITF official from Italy was worried that the<BR>rains may disrupt today's tournament at which 24 tennis players<BR>are competing for honours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All the 24 players are already in the country. They all<BR>arrived earlier than the expected days. But now the problem is the<BR>rains. We were supposed to have started today but the rains have<BR>completely affected the courts. The courts are now in a terrible<BR>state after the rains,&quot; moaned Lugi. Sixteen players are playing<BR>unseeded in the event that is expected to start in the morning<BR>today to make up for yesterday's event which was put off because<BR>of the rains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from the South African players, the other African country<BR>represented is Ivory Coast, who is represented by unseeded Tomboveteran from Italy who managed a semi final berth at last year's<BR>olino Alessanjro.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have only managed to get two tents from National Milling and<BR>I don't know what will happen if it rains and we don't find enough<BR>tents,&quot; disclosed Fuliwa to local tennis officials at the Lusaka<BR>Club last evening.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Lack of action by the government is like trying to hide our<BR>heads in the sand or we simply don't care about human rights<BR>violations,&quot; he said.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If this country believes in democracy and human rights, they<BR>should take action against Nigeria for the execution of nine human<BR>rights activists in that country,&quot; he said adding: &quot;If big powers<BR>like USA and Britain have cut relations with Nigeria, then who are<BR>we to remain aloof?&quot; asked Sayila.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a letter to the human rights organisation, Afronet, Amnesty<BR>International was keen to know the circumstances of Nkumbula's<BR>death. &quot;What is the latest information regarding the death of<BR>Baldwin Nkumbula?

Africa must brace itself<BR>for a 50 per cent cut in aid in the next five years because much<BR>of the aid it has received has not been used to improve the<BR>welfare of the African people. It has instead found itself in the<BR>pockets of government officials,&quot; he said. &quot;American taxpayers are<BR>now wondering why they should contribute to donor aid when it only<BR>benefits a small group of politicians.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the aid that went to the private sector was excellently<BR>utilised while &quot;government-to-government&quot; aid has been a wasted<BR>effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This kind of aid just up in the bank accounts of government<BR>officials and does not improve the welfare of the suffering<BR>majorities,&quot; he said. He also said any African country which<BR>completely cuts off corruption, privatises its parastatals and<BR>makes people rich will attract great amounts of money from foreign<BR>investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is much corruption especially where foreign aid is<BR>concerned. In Zimbabwe, for example, donor food is used to promote<BR>the ruling ZANU-PF. This tendency promotes one-partyism when in<BR>fact the aid comes from a multi-party country -- USA,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cripps described the practice by the ruling party in Zambia to<BR>use donor food as a means to compel voters to decide in its favour<BR>as &quot;corrupt&quot;. But finance minister, Ronald Penza, was not bothered<BR>by Cripp's criticism because it was not part of US government's<BR>policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Cripps is free to express his opinion. I would only comment if<BR>his views were expressed by an American government official,&quot;<BR>Penza said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when reminded that US assistant secretary of state for<BR>Africa George Moose had expressed similar sentiments on US aid to<BR>Africa, Penza replied: &quot;It is not just the American government<BR>that has changed its stance on the issue of aid but governments<BR>all over the world. We have decided to change the scope of<BR>Overseas Development Aid (ODA) and we all agree development should<BR>no longer revolve around donor aid,&quot; he said. Moose had said the<BR>American government will now only give aid to countries that were<BR>serious with economic success. Cripps has been invited to Zambia<BR>by the Zambia Chambers of Commerce Trade and Industry (ZACCI) and<BR>the Economic Association of Zambia (EAZ). He holds a free lecture<BR>on &quot;Revolutionising management&quot; at Pamodzi Hotel on November 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The management expert, who has worked extensively all over the<BR>world, also said the Zambian economy may not pick up if the<BR>country continued to segregate against talent on the basis of<BR>nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The secret of America's success lies in its acceptance and<BR>utilisation of people - whether they are American or not -- on the<BR>basis of their talents and not their nationality,&quot; he said, adding<BR>the so called &quot;indiginisation&quot; in African countries, was not good<BR>for development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cripps said the emphasis on nationality rather than skill may<BR>incapacitate Zambia's ability to produce world class products.<BR>According to Cripps, there is stagnation in the management skills<BR>presently in use in strategic industries in the country and lashed<BR>out at the retrogressive red-tape regulating business conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Old people must move aside and let new ideas blossom. I find<BR>the case of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) very<BR>interesting. Bureaucracy is actually what is holding the<BR>privatisation of the conglomerate,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The people managing the economy and the companies must<BR>themselves make concerted efforts to employ more modern management<BR>styles so that the workers under them work harder. Government<BR>interference and the bureaucratic nature of most management<BR>strategies in Africa have been detrimental to the success of<BR>business,&quot; he said.<BR>-0Zambia</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Sudan Democratic Gazette (London)<BR>November 24, 1995 (19951124)<BR>by Bona Malwal, editor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - Human rights have all but disappeared in Sudan<BR>following the regime's response to the September demonstrations,<BR>yet the international community has paid little attention. The<BR>exception was the coverage given to the visit of the Archbishop of<BR>Canterbury, Dr George Carey, during September. However, now that<BR>the visit has come and gone, Sudan has once again disappeared from<BR>the pages and screens of the international media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are many reasons why the world's attention has been<BR>diverted away from Sudan. Not least because of the regime's<BR>adeptness at promoting its own position. Another reason is that<BR>Sudan has never been a popular topic for the international media.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan has yet to provide as attractive stories as Somalia, Rwanda<BR>and Bosnia. Besides, successive Sudanese regimes have closed the<BR>door to the international media and the present regime is the<BR>worst. Could the genocidal campaign in the Nuba Mountains have<BR>taken place if the world's media were to be encamped inside Sudan?<BR>Would the regime's forces have been able to violate the Guinea<BR>Worm cease-fire with impunity if the world's media had been<BR>present in Southern Sudan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime has recently attempted to convince the world that it<BR>is aspiring to improve its human rights record. Long term<BR>observers know that these impressions are false but there are many<BR>willing to accept them at their face value. Perhaps the most<BR>outrageous attempt by the regime to curry favour with the world<BR>was the announcement in August that it would shortly release all<BR>its political prisoners from detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime has thousands of its opponents held in hidden<BR>detention centres, and it would have been particularly naive to<BR>think that it would release all of them in one go. A few high<BR>profile individuals were released in August but the nameless<BR>masses remained incarcerated. Following the September<BR>demonstrations, the regime's jails and ghost houses have swelled<BR>once more, and August's gesture has remained an empty one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why has the international media chosen to ignore Sudan at a<BR>time when repression is on the increase? The answer is difficult<BR>to ascertain considering the high profile terrorism trials in<BR>America and the assassination attempt on the Egyptian president,<BR>Hosni Mubarek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two events have given some hope. Dr Carey's frank assessment of<BR>the poor human rights situation in Sudan and the religious<BR>persecution of Christians was one. The other was the European<BR>parliament's resolution calling on the international community to<BR>take the regime's human rights abuses seriously by imposing<BR>sanctions. The &quot;Gazette&quot; has called for such action in the past<BR>and endorses the European parliament's moves today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hopefully the United States Congress will support the call for<BR>sanctions through its House of Representatives sub-committee on<BR>Africa. That committee has been at the forefront of the<BR>international efforts to highlight the regime's human rights<BR>abuses. Hopefully it will add its support by sponsoring a similar<BR>resolution of its own urging the US administration of President<BR>Bill Clinton to lead the way towards punitive sanctions against<BR>the NIF regime. Without such punitive measures it will be<BR>impossible to change the regime's ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Undoubtedly the people of Sudan will eventually rid themselves<BR>of the twin scourges of Islamic Fundamentalism and terrorism.<BR>However, firm international resolve in the present situation will<BR>bring that day closer and reduce the cost that the Sudanese will<BR>have to pay to return their country to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lack of real concern from the world for the plight of the<BR>Sudanese people is entirely the fault of the world's media which<BR>has failed to sufficiently highlight the real conditions of<BR>suffering in Sudan. Now that there are signs that the Bosnian<BR>tragedy is nearing a peaceful conclusion, perhaps the media will<BR>switch its attention to the repressed and suffering in Sudan,<BR>where Christians' and non-Moslems are being persecuted and Moslems<BR>are being repressed by Islamic fundamentalists. Fairness and<BR>justice demands that the international media do this.<BR>-0Zambia</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Sudan Democratic Gazette (London)<BR>November 24, 1995 (19951124)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khartoum - Seasoned Sudan observers have become used to the<BR>National Islamic Front (NIF) regime's annual dry season offensive.<BR>Each year it is planned and billed as the final offensive which<BR>will militarily defeat the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)<BR>and end the war in the South once and for all. This year's targets<BR>have a familiar ring to them, Nimule on the border with Uganda,<BR>Western Equatoria and civilian targets behind SPLA lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The border with Uganda has become an important target for the<BR>regime since the break in relations with the government of Yoweri<BR>Museveni. The regime is supporting and supplying the Lords<BR>Resistance Army (LRA) which is fighting against the Museveni<BR>government in northern Uganda. Control of the border will make the<BR>support easier.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Western Equatoria Fronts: The regime hopes to open up<BR>several routes into Western Equatoria, the only part of the South<BR>totally controlled by the SPLA. Following the success last year of<BR>re-taking Kaya by infiltrating troops back into Sudan from Zaire,<BR>the regime hopes to repeat this by infiltrating troops across the<BR>border and towards Maridi. A second column will move from Yei<BR>through the old Ngamunde Mountains road. A third through Lanya and<BR>Mundri. A fifth will move through the old second world war route<BR>from Rumbek through Macharanga. A fourth column will attempt to<BR>move from Wau to Tombura and may make use of a road inside the<BR>border of the Central African Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening disused roads, and trying to transport convoys of heavy<BR>mechanised equipment along them will lead to slow progress for the<BR>regime's forces. It will also make them sitting targets for the<BR>SPLA's more mobile guerrilla forces. Even in the dry season,<BR>Western Equatoria's terrain provides more than sufficient cover<BR>for a guerrilla army. In any case, these routes have been tried in<BR>previous offensives did not work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime's forces need to make considerable progress and take<BR>Maridi or Tombura before the end of March when the rains begin<BR>once more. What has happened in recent years is that the<BR>mechanised columns make slow progress and then have to return to<BR>their point of origin or risk becoming stranded en route when the<BR>rains make progress impossible. Those units that have been<BR>stranded in the past have only served to resupply the SPLA with<BR>captured weapons and ammunition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Progress from Wau to Tombura will be as difficult as ever<BR>because the SPLA still controls the south bank of the River Bo<BR>some sixty miles south of Wau. The regime will have immense<BR>problems trying to ferry troops across. Without achieving this,<BR>the front may be closed in defeat before it is opened in victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nimule Front: the regime has been trying to capture Nimule<BR>for several years without any success. The only new advantage that<BR>the regime can claim is the control of Kajokeji and Kaya. Even<BR>then it is difficult to see how the control of these two posts<BR>might constitute an advantage if both are under siege by the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps the real advantage and difference this year is that the<BR>regime has well resupplied its bases in the South during the four<BR>months of the so-called Guinea Worm cease-fire. It is known that<BR>three Chinese ships have been unloaded at Port Sudan and they were<BR>believed to be full of weapons destined for the South. They docked<BR>in June and so there has been plenty of time for the weapons to<BR>have been transported to the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, China has remodelled the Sudan army's American F5<BR>fighter planes that had fallen into disrepair. The United States<BR>had refused to supply spare parts. The army's American supplied<BR>C130 transport planes and their Soviet made Antonov long range<BR>bombers have all been maintained and will be used for the resupply<BR>of troops and for attacking civilian targets behind the SPLA<BR>lines, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iranian Connection: It is far from clear where the money for<BR>the new supplies has come from. China deals with Sudan on a<BR>strictly cash only basis. Iran has paid China for Sudan's weapons<BR>in the past but has shown little interest in doing so in the past<BR>eighteen months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, as we were preparing this article, the Iranian deputy<BR>minister for foreign affairs, Mohamed Juaad Lorigan told the<BR>London based Arabic Language daily newspaper &quot;Al Hayat&quot; that his<BR>country is &quot;supplying arms and ammunition to the regime to help<BR>them in their civil war in the South&quot;. The Sudanese minister of<BR>foreign affairs, Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, naturally played this<BR>down in another interview with another London based Arabic<BR>language magazine, &quot;Al Wasat&quot;, a few days later by only confirming<BR>the earlier military aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is also rumoured that the Gulf state of Qatar has footed the<BR>bill. The NIF regime has had close relations with the ruler of<BR>that state, both the father and the son who deposed him in a coup<BR>recently. The regime has also developed close relations with<BR>Moslem rulers in Asia. Both Malaysia and Indonesia have hosted<BR>visits from Lieutenant General Omer Hassan El Beshir, the regime's<BR>military dictator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Impact of the Cease-fire: Before the Guinea Worm cease-fire<BR>was brokered by former US president Jimmy Carter, the regime's<BR>forces in the South were in considerable disarray. The cease-fire<BR>was seized upon as an ideal opportunity to resupply, reinforce and<BR>reequip the regime's garrisons in the South. Such moves clearly<BR>violated the cease-fire but there was no provision for monitoring<BR>it in place in the South. The SPLA had no choice but to accept the<BR>cease-fire, given its humanitarian aspect, although it could have<BR>demanded proper monitoring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international community will be able to decide for itself,<BR>once the offensive gets going, whether the advantages of<BR>immunising a few thousand Southern children during the cease-fire<BR>outweigh the havoc wreaked in their communities by the resupplied<BR>troops of the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not Total Darkness: In spite of the clear abuse of the ceaseThe Lafon Declaration from April instituted an understanding<BR>fire by the regime, it is not all dark and gloomy for the South.<BR>between the forces of William Nyuon in the Southern Sudan<BR>Independence Movement(SSIM) and the SPLA. This has meant a<BR>decrease in the fighting in Upper Nile between the different<BR>Southern factions. As a result it will be far more difficult for<BR>the regime to assist and reinforce its forces in Eastern Equatoria<BR>from Malakal, as was the case in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another development has been the switch in allegiance by the<BR>Mundari tribal militia which had been supporting the regime's<BR>forces against the SPLA. The militia is reported to be cothat the regime will have difficulty using the river route to<BR>operating with the SPLA and if this is indeed true, it will mean<BR>resupply Juba from the North. The Mundari militia control a<BR>significant part of the river as it passes through their<BR>territory. It will be good to see the Dinka of Bor and Yirol corule tactics of the regime which caused their disagreements in the<BR>operating once more with the Mundari because it was the divide and<BR>first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of the regime's offensive, Southern Sudan is likely to<BR>emerge from the current dry season at the end of the day in much<BR>the same way as it has always done at the end of each dry season,<BR>still a force to reckon with.<BR>-0Sudan</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Presidential aide Richard Sakala and a man claiming to<BR>be President Chiluba's uncle, Maxwell Chisoko Kalesha yesterday<BR>accused The Post of working in collusion with former president<BR>Kenneth Kaunda to discredit the<BR>President as elections were around the corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kalesha said his family would take the newspaper to court so<BR>that the issue<BR>of his nephew's disputed origin was settled once and for all. At a<BR>specially arranged State House afternoon press briefing to deny<BR>yesterday's Post's front page story &quot;FTJ was born in Zaire&quot;<BR>Kalesha complained about the negative reporting by the newspaper<BR>on the President alleging that its motives were to bring him down<BR>from the presidency. &quot;It's a pity that we should allow a bad paper<BR>like The Post to exist in this country. The Post is full of lies,<BR>and no one should believe it, &quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pleaded with the people not to doubt the origin of President<BR>Chiluba<BR>because he was a true Zambian born in Wusakili and still had some<BR>of his<BR>paternal and maternal relatives alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Kafupi's claims that he was President Chiluba's biological<BR>father,<BR>Kalesha rebuffed these claims, insisting that he (Kafupi) had<BR>failed to<BR>substantiate anything and was consequently convicted by Mwata<BR>Kazembe's<BR>court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, Sakala said that The Post were using a Mr Simusokwe<BR>and a Mr<BR>Kapusa, once used by the UNIP regime to investigate President<BR>Chiluba's<BR>origins and warned the paper that the government would soon move<BR>decisively<BR>and prove to the people that the paper was telling lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are concerned with the manner in which The Post has been<BR>gathering<BR>and fabricating false information about the origins of the because<BR>of the<BR>presidential and general election next year&quot; he said.<BR>He said the newspaper had offered K300, 000 to try and bribe some<BR>people in<BR>Zaire so that they could provide information on the birth records<BR>of the<BR>President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sakala the issue of the President's origin had been started in<BR>1981 but<BR>that The Post, together with Kaunda's men, had intensified the<BR>search<BR>because of the forthcoming elections in 1996. He promised to bring<BR>the<BR>people from where The Post bought the information before the press<BR>within<BR>the week.<BR>-0Tunisia</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The United States of America has made a public call to<BR>the Zambian government to be transparent in the handling of the<BR>constitutional reform and the voters registration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A high ranking US government official said in Lusaka yesterday<BR>that the confidence of citizens in the integrity of the political<BR>process is essential in gaining public support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;To this end we encourage the government to undertake such<BR>critical programmes as constitutional reform and voter<BR>registration in the kind of open, transparent and realistic<BR>fashion which serves to build this confidence,&quot; said Carol<BR>Lancaster, deputy administrator of the United States Agency for<BR>International Development (USAID).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was speaking at the Lusaka International Airport prior to<BR>her departure after a two-day visit with Zambian government and<BR>non-governmental organisation officials. Her remarks come in the<BR>wake of increased public resentment towards the manner in which<BR>the MMD government is attempting to adopt and enact the next<BR>Zambian constitution against popular will.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week hundreds of members of civic organisations, political<BR>parties, student, women's movement, farmers and chiefs resolved at<BR>a national conference in Lusaka to block government effort to rush<BR>the constitution to parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have planned counter action which includes their own<BR>citizens convention on December 16, and a Constituent Assembly on<BR>January 13, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting also resolved to mobilise countrywide protests<BR>against the government move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lancaster also warned government against tolerance for<BR>corruption. She said the government should take steps to ensure<BR>the independence of investigatory bodies &quot;in order to eliminate<BR>any perception of the kind of high-level corruption that so badly<BR>corrodes public faith in, and support for, essential reform<BR>programmes on which so much progress has been made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The US stance comes within weeks of a warning by an American<BR>management expert, Jeremy Cripps, who attacked the Zambian<BR>government for misusing donor assistance in an exclusive interview<BR>with The Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But yesterday's official statement is the second open<BR>expression of increasing donor displeasure against the Zambian<BR>government for lack of transparency and good governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the good governance meeting on October 30 donors were said<BR>to be firm in criticising Zambia's record and tied their aid to<BR>specific demands. &quot;A majority of donor countries made it clear<BR>that the amount of aid to Zambia will be related to good<BR>governance,&quot; a government official who attended the meeting told<BR>The Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He claimed that donors also insisted on a constituent assembly<BR>to adopt Zambia's constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The revelations of donor concerns as published in The Post<BR>displeased the government who warned its, &quot;cooperating partners<BR>that the substance of discussions at such meetings should be<BR>respected and not carelessly discussed with persons not involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lancaster yesterday disclosed that President Chiluba has made<BR>assurances to her about his government commitment to<BR>democratisation, structural adjustment and transparency.She<BR>described her meeting with the President as &quot;good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a cabinet minister revealed yesterday that pressure has<BR>been mounting on the Zambian government from donors who are<BR>reluctant to support the MMD programme if it departed from<BR>specific good governance demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The pressure has been increasing as the Paris Club meeting<BR>approaches. I am not surprised at the US position,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This position comes ahead of a consultative meeting in Lusaka<BR>on December 5 next week and a dinner expected to be hosted by<BR>State House for participating donors on December 7 in preparation<BR>for the Paris Club meeting on December 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lancaster however said the MMD government &quot;deserves credit for<BR>broad gains in economic liberalisation,&quot;including parastatal<BR>closures and privatisation. She said the Zambia Privatisation<BR>Agency &quot;will show the way for other African countries struggling<BR>to privatise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was flanked by the deputy director of the USAID Center for<BR>Democracy, Jennifer Windsor, who said she was impressed by the<BR>progress made in democratisation in Zambia and the level of debate<BR>on various issues which symbolised real democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the U.S.government has been assured by the ViceZambia for hunger relief &quot;will be dealt with firmly.&quot;<BR>President's office that any sale of food donated by the US to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US embassy spokesman Lincoln Dahl said this in response to a<BR>query about whether his government was aware of claims that 20,000<BR>tonnes of donated sorghum was being sold on the open market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As noted earlier, US relief food is not to be sold and 90 per<BR>cent of it is intended for food-for-work programmes,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He expressed confidence that both the World Food Programme and<BR>the Office of the Vice President were capable of securely<BR>distributing the 20,000 tonnes of relief food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tuesday, Mpika MP Guy Scott told parliament that 20,000 tonnes<BR>of relief food donated by the US government was being offered for<BR>sale to traders on the open market by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said this when making a contribution to a speech by Viceavert hunger following the drought.Miyanda pleaded ignorance of<BR>President Godfrey Miyanda on steps the government had taken to<BR>such sales of but offered to investigate the matter to establish<BR>the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If that is happening I must state that it is wrong and does<BR>not reflect well on the people that donated the food. I will not<BR>allow such a thing to happen, so I will follow it up,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 20,000 tonnes of relief sorghum was donated last week by<BR>the US government.<BR>-0Zambia</SPAN></P>
