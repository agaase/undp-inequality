<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - As part of its three-year transition programme to democracy, expected to end in october 1998, Nigeria's military regime has created six new states, making the west African country a 36-state federation of 100 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The exercise of state creation is not new to our nation,&quot; the military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, said Tuesday when announcing the creation of the new states in a broadcast to mark Nigeria's 36th anniversary of independence from Britain in 1960.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a-three-regional structure at independence, a fourth region (The Mid- West Region) was carved out of the old Western Region in 1963. In May 1967, the Gowon administration, exploiting the political mood of the period, transformed Nigeria into a-12-state federation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Murtala administration that overthrew the Gowon regime, restructured Nigeria into a federation of 19 states. The Babangida government increased the number to 30 with 593 local councils and the Federal capital territory, Abuja, before the latest addition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha also announced the creation of 183 additional local councils to bring the overall total to 776.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He conceded that &quot;this rapid and enormous expansion of our political and administrative structure within less than four decades has continued to exert heavy pressure on our economy and system of governance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said the latest exercise was &quot;to ensure fair spread and balancing within the geo-political zones of the country applying such criteria as population and land mass, among others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new states include Bayelsa, carved out of the old southeastern state of Rivers with Yenegoa as its headquarters. Others are Ekiti from the former western state of Ondo, with Ado-Ekiti as capital, and Ebonyi, excised from the eastern states of Enugu and Abia, with Abakiliki as capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three other states are Nasarawa, with headquarters in Lafia, carved out of the old middle-belt state of Plateau, while Gombe and Zamfara are the two new states from the north. Gombe, with capital in Gombe, is from the old Bauchi state and Zamfara with Gusau as capital is from the former Sokoto state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abacha administration in December, 1995 set up a committee on the creation of states, local governments and boundary adjustment. The committee received a total of 72 requests for new states, 2,369 for local councils and 286 on boundary adjustment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new committee is to continue work on the boundary demarcation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an apparent move to assuage those whose requests were not met, Abacha warned against &quot;festivities and jubilation among communities over the creation of new states and council areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agitators often see state creation as passport to larger share of the national wealth and for bringing governance closer to their doorsteps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Abacha warned that the latest exercise should be seen in the light of &quot; administrative convenience and necessity rather than the separation of peoples and communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the transition programme, he called for &quot;a disciplined and orderly conduct of partisan politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His government has registered as parties for the transition politics, five of the 15 political associations that applied for registration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha warned politicians to &quot;avoid the pitfalls of the past, learn from the bitter experiences we have passed through and build a strong and virile democratic culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his address, which also touched on socio-economic issues, he announced the setting up of a high-powered national committee on the education problem in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee of &quot;eminent professionals and well-meaning Nigerians,&quot; would examine past and present policies on eduction, study the problems that had retarded education growth and proffer solutions, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers of Nigeria's 38 federal and state-run universities have been on strike since April 9, demanding improved conditions of service and better funding of the universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha also named businessman Ernest Shonekan, as chairman of another high- powered committee on Nigeria's economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shonekan was head of the interim civilian administration, which former military ruler Gen. Ibrahim Babangida installed when he stepped out of office in August 1993, after annulling the presidential election in June that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha took over power from Shonekan on 17 Nov. 1993 in the heat of political crisis over the annulled presidential poll. Abacha charged the Shonekan committee with implementing the military government's new 'vision 2010' programme, to lay a solid economic foundation for national progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the short run, he said his administration would consolidate the economic gains of the immediate past by putting in place &quot;appropriate policy measures to bring down cost of food stuff, goods and services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Families of political detainees were disappointed that Abacha's speech said nothing about those in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There had been high public expectation that he would have addressed the issue, especially that of politician Moshood Abiola, the acclaimed winner of the annulled presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abiola is awaiting trial for treason after declaring himself president of Nigeria in June 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABIDJAN, Cote d'Ivoire - The police in Cote d'Ivoire can now physically conduct searches on individuals, vehicles and homes and private places at any time of the day under a law adopted by parliament here Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, whose objective is to curb the spiral of banditry in this West African country of about 14 million people, was approved by 155 votes while 13 voted against it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The searches would be conducted on any suspicion that there has been a breach of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before its adoption into law, the bill was vehemently criticized by certain politicians and humanitarian organizations, including the Ivorian Human Rights League.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The League argued the proposed legislation would be in violation of the universal declaration of human rights and the freedom of citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, at an earlier luncheon organized for the law makers, President Henri Konan Bedie had asked them to pass the law to give the security forces the means to combat the rise in organized crime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in an interview with journalists, Moose said the meeting was to help redefine joint notions between the two countries on conflict management and how best to rationalize them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia Railways and Zimbabwe's National Railways have 84 million British pounds sterling stuck in the liquidated Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's deputy communications and transport minister, Gilbert Mululu, disclosed in Lusaka Monday that the money was transferred into the failed bank's account from a Barclays Bank account three days before the bank ran into trouble.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BCCI was closed in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are hopeful that the money may be recovered when the liquidators of the bank declare proceeds to various creditors... We shall receive our share of the money as soon as the liquidators of the bank declare how much we shall receive,&quot; Mululu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the money was held in trust for the defunct Rhodesia Railways, whose assets were shared between Zimbabwe and Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mululu explained that some assets could not be practically divided such as buildings and similar infrastructure, which was sold, from which the money locked up in the bank was realized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent meeting between Zambian and Zimbabwean officials decided that a new company be formed to handle the sale of infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new company known as Emerged Railways Properties, will have offices registered both in Zambia and Zimbabwe, and would be handling non-divisible assets of the old railway company and the Victoria Falls Bridge in southern Zambia, which was also jointly owned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique - The man named by a South African police defector Dirk Coetzee as the assassin of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme is living in Beira and working for a company called Transport Commodity Trading (TCT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony James White's presence in Beira is far from clandestine: in 1994 he was among representatives of timber companies who protested loudly at attempts by the former rebel movement, Renamo, to extort money from businesses working in hardwood forests under Renamo control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's issue of the independent newsheet, Mediafax, cites anonymous South African sources as saying that White was involved in contraband operations in the 1980s, and was linked to both the South African and the Mozambican security services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper says that its sources seemed afraid of White. The sources contacted by the well-informed Mediafax in Beira and in Pretoria warned:&quot; Be careful with him&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notorious South African spy Craig Williamson, whom the apartheid regime boasted infiltrated the upper echelons of the liberation movement, the ANC, admits that he worked with White in a company called &quot;Longreach&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the word &quot;Longreach&quot; seems to have very sinister connotations. For Coetzee, and his successor at the head of the South African police Vlakplaas death squad, Eugene de Kock, what really existed was &quot;Operation Longreach&quot;, a plan to assassinate the outspokenly anti-apartheid Swedish Premier (and perhaps other foreign leaders too - less than eight months after Palme's death in February 1986, Mozambican President Samora Machel died in a mysterious plane crash on South African soil).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mediafax writes that Williamson had a &quot;dual relationship&quot; with Mozambique.  He claimed to have acted as a channel between the Mozambican and South African governments in the late 1980s, but also had a business link with TCT, widely viewed as a company set up by the now defunct Mozambican Security Service, SNASP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Security Minister Mariano Matsinhe, however, denied Williamson's boast. He told Mediafax that he never needed to use a lower level figure like Williamson when he could go directly to much higher figures in the apartheid military apparatus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a direct channel with the South African army&quot;, he said. 'I didn't need any liaison officer. My contact was Gen (Jannie) Geldenhuis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matsinhe claimed that he knew Willimason through TCT, and believed that he was also involved in the Mozambican fisheries sector. (Williamson has confirmed to the Swedish paper, Aftonbladet, that he had interests in lobster fishing south of Beira).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether he knew White, Matsinhe said &quot;there's a White in Beira. I think he's managing a sector of TCT&quot;. He is. White runs a TCT sawmill on the outskirts of Beira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matsinhe denied that TCT was a company run by Mozambican security. But he admitted it was set up by Filipe Franco, a Mozambican with known security links.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matsinhe said he believed that Franco is currently in Angola. That is also where Williamson is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from its Beira operations, TCT also has an office in Maputo. On Monday it was locked up with no sign of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mozambique news agency, AIM, has been unable to contact TCT in Beira, because many of Beira's phone numbers still have no contact with Maputo following the collapse of the telecommunication company's parabolic antenna at the Beira earth station in mid-September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the French news agency, AFP, managed to speak to White from Harare: He categorically denied any involvement in the Palme assassination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently de Kock, who started the latest round of investigations into the Palme murder by naming Williamson as the man who masterminded it, does not agree with Coetzee that it was White who pulled the trigger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the daily Johannesburg newspaper, The Star, of Monday, another South African death squad member, Peter Casselton, said he had spoken personally with de Kock in prison on Sunday, and de Kock excluded White from operation Longreach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did, however, link White and Williamson in the smuggling of 84 tons of ivory from Burundi in the early 1980s, and in the trafficking of rhinoceros horns in South Africa itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, it seems that the Swedish authorities themselves are not taking Coetzee's denunciation seriously enough to press the Mozambican government into taking any action. As of Monday afternoon there had been no official Swedish contact with the office of the Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - This is number 28 (23 - 29 September 1996) in a series of weekly reports from IRIN on general developments in the Great Lakes region. Sources for the information below include UN agencies, NGOs, other international organisations and media reports. IRIN issues these reports for the benefit of the humanitarian community, but accepts no responsibility as to the accuracy of the original sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee (RSCC) held its second meeting in Kigali, Rwanda on Wednesday and said that Pierre Buyoya, leader of Burundi's regime, should be &quot;available&quot; for the next regional summit. Noting the 'positive steps' taken by the regime towards meeting the conditions set out by the Arusha II summit, the Committee emphasized that the 'most important condition yet to be fully met is the immediate and unconditional negotiations with all groups.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Other leaders of parties to the conflict' may also be invited to to the next regional summit, according to the RSCC statement. This is thought to include Leonard Nyangoma, leader of the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), whose armed wing, the FDD, is fighting within Burundi. The Committee decided that sanctions 'have so far been effective' and will stay in place, although fertilizer and vegetable seeds have been exempted from the embargo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No date has been set for the proposed third regional summit, but preparations for this will take place at a Ministerial meeting to be held on 10 October, and the summit, at the Heads of State level, is expected to follow soon afterwards. The next meeting of the RSCC will take place in Arusha, Tanzania, on 8 October. The full RSCC statement is available from IRIN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RSCC's decision to invite Major Buyoya to the next regional summit was welcomed by Jean-Luc Ndizeye, his spokesman, as &quot;a very good step, but a small step.&quot; Ndizeye again called for the total lifting of the sanctions, saying that &quot;the embargo is killing any chances of peace in Burundi&quot;.  Buyoya's spokesman would not comment on the part of the statement inviting leaders of other parties to the conflict to attend the next summit, saying only &quot;we will analyse the issue when the time comes.&quot; On 22 September Pierre Buyoya had said in an interview with the East African newspaper that he was &quot; ready to start negotiations with armed factions&quot; but that &quot;on the other side they are not ready&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope John Paul II on Wednesday called for the sanctions to be eased, saying they are &quot;creating a greater burden for the civilian population&quot;. His remarks came at the end of his weekly general audience when making a tribute to Burundian Archbishop Joachim Ruhuna, who died in an ambush on 9 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The power struggle within FRODEBU intensified on Wednesday with 34 party activists in Nairobi declaring their support for Leonard Nyangoma, leader of the CNDD. Their declaration followed Mr Nyangoma's announcement on 19 September that he had taken over the party's presidency from former parliamentary speaker Jean Minani. This had been rejected by Mr Minani and by Augustin Nzojibwami, the secretary-general of FRODEBU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nzojibwami was one of five FRODEBU officials reported last week to have left the German ambassador's residence in Bujumbura, where they had taken refuge. Mr Nzojibwami said that they had left their refuge to fill the vacuum in which Mr Nyangoma had made his announcement. He claimed FRODEBU would need to hold a party congress to turn its policy away from &quot;non-violence and consensus&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The town of Bukavu in South Kivu, Zaire, was reported calm at the end of the week after Zaire and Rwanda agreed on a ceasefire following exchanges of mortar fire on Sunday 22 September, Monday and Tuesday. Both Governments accused the other of having started the shelling, which killed at least one Zairean and injured five others on Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean version of events is that the exchange of fire first began on the Sunday after prisoners escaped from the central prison in Cyangugu, Rwanda. The Rwandese Patriotic Army was said to have shot at them as well as some Zairean soldiers near the border. The Zaireans claim that this was when they began firing at Rwanda. The Rwandans claim, however, that the shelling was started by Zaire. A ceasefire was negotiated on Tuesday, but on Wednesday the deputy governor of South Kivu, Lwabandji Lwasi, accused the Rwandans of breaking it by firing shots over the border. No further incidents have been reported since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The insecurity prompted the United Nations to relocate 23 'non-essential' expatriate aid agency personnel to Nairobi on Tuesday. The International Federation of the Red Cross also evacuated three of its seven delegates in Bukavu after two shells landed in the garden of a hotel where IFRC staff were staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shelling between Rwanda and Zaire reflects growing tension between the two countries following accusations by the Zairean authorities that the RPA have been training Banyamulenge near Uvira, South Kivu, and encouraging them to destabilise eastern Zaire, using Burundi as a rear base. This claim has been categorically rejected by the Governments of Rwanda and Burundi.  Meanwhile, a UN Special Envoy of the Secretary- General, Ibrahima Fall, arrived in Kinshasa on 22 September to seek clarification on Zairean allegations that UNHCR had provided logistic support to armed groups infiltrating from Zaire and Rwanda. The charge was categorically rejected by the UN Secretary-General on 17 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge are Zairean Tutsis who migrated from Rwanda into Zaire over several centuries and who say they have been targetted in recent months by the Zairean Army and authorities. According to reports from a Banyamulenge spokesman in exile, the Zairean authorities executed 40 Banyamulenge held in detention on Sunday 22 September. This was said to have been in retaliation for the killings of Zairean soldiers by Banyamulenge militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction: IRIN would like a correct a factual error in last week's Weekly Roundup (22.9.96). In a section on accusations against the local authorities in Uvira by Amnesty International the District Commissioner was named incorrectly. A subsequent Amnesty statement corrected this to Shweka Mutabazi.  We apologize for any misunderstandings which may have arisen from this error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) agreed on Wednesday to postpone the trial of Georges Rutaganda, suspected of genocide and crimes against humanity, until 6 March 1997 on grounds of ill health. Mr Rutaganda is accused of being the second vice-president of the Interahamwe militia and of having played a leading role in the genocide. The court rejected, however, a request by Rutaganda's defence counsel that he be allowed to go to Europe for treatment of his illness, saying that he was receiving adequate care in a local civilian hospital in Arusha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Luc de Temmerman, the defence counsel, nor the court have revealed what illness he is suffering from, but Mr de Temmerman claimed that &quot;if he is not treated in Europe, he won't be there in March to be tried&quot;. Meanwhile, the ICTR accepted on Friday a prosecution request that names of witnesses should not be disclosed to the public on security grounds. Yakob Haile Mariam, prosecting counsel, said one witness in Rwanda had already been told she would be killed if she went to Tanzania to testify against Mr Rutaganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICTR began the trial last week of Jean-Paul Akayesu, the former mayor of Taba in central Rwanda, also accused of having played a major role in the genocide. Before the trial got underway, African Rights, the London-based human rights organisation, released a report detailing Akayesu's actions during the genocide and showing that he 'went to extraordinary lengths to ensure the wholesale slaughter of Tutsis in his commune'. The full report is available from IRIN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial of Akayesu, however, has also been postponed - this time for one month. Johan Scheers, his defence counsel, threatened on Friday to resign unless the court granted his request for a postponement of the case, saying that he had been given insufficient time to prepare his case. On Thursday the ICTR was also attacked by the Governments of Rwanda and Zimbabwe for slow progress since its establishment. They accused the UN of racial bias, saying that the Tribunal had acted more quickly to bring Bosnian war criminals to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The UNHCR announced on Tuesday that it was excluding from refugee status 20 Rwandans indicted by the International Tribunal in connection with the genocide. The list includes people who are currently being held in Arusha as well as others known to be in Europe and in refugee camps and elsewhere in Africa. The UNHCR is urging Governments not to provide those listed with asylum. They are: Ignace Bagilishema, Charles Sikubwabo, Aloys Ndimbati, Vincent Rutaganira, Mika Muhimana, Ryandikayo, Obed Ruzindana, Clement Kayishema, Jean-Paul Akayesu, Georges Rutaganda, Alfred Musema, Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, Gerard Ntakirutimana, Andre Ntagerura, Ladislas Ntaganzwa, Anatole Nsengiyumva, Elie Ndayambaje, Ferdinand Nahimana, Theoneste Bagosora and Eliezer Niyitegeka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The South African Government has been criticized by South African human rights groups, arms officials and politicians for its decision on Thursday to approve private sales of weapons to Rwanda. The decision has predictably been criticized by the RDR (Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda), the umbrella organisation representing Rwandan refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rwanda's Ambassador to France, Christophe Mfizi, resigned from his post on Tuesday according to media reports. The embassy did not say why Mfizi, who was appointed to Paris in March 1995, had resigned. The first secretary, Modeste Rutabayiru, will temporarily replace him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Human Rights Watch and the Federation Internationale de Ligues des Droits de L'Homme called on Monday for the International Tribunal to investigate and prosecute rape and other gender-related crimes. The ICTR has to date issued no indictments for rape or other forms of sexual violence. The call followed the release of an HRW/FIDH report entitled, 'Shattered Lives: Sexual Violence During the Rwandan Genocide and its Aftermath', which details 'horrific' attacks on women and their families during the genocide. HRW/FIDH's recommendations included a call on donors to ensure that aid programmes meet women's needs, especially in the areas of criminal justice, health care, housing, credit, education, vocational training and trauma conselling, and on the Government of Rwanda to improve coordination between ministries seeking to issues relating to women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Some 284 people were killed in Rwanda in August according to a report by the UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) released on Wednesday.  HRFOR blamed the RPA for 159 of these deaths, while responsibility for the other killings lay with Hutu rebels who continued to target local officials and survivors of the genocide. The prison population reached 81,300 at the end of August, an increase of 2,800 since July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The peace agreement between the Ugandan and Sudanese Governments came under strain last week after the Sudanese Government all but admitted having bombed northern Uganda on Sunday 22 September. On Monday Amama Mbabazi, Uganda's Minister of Defence, had said that two Sudanese MiG planes dropped bombs aimed at the army barracks in Moyo on Sunday 22 September, but missed their target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese Government at first denied the claim, but later admitted that the attack had taken place. Iran's deputy foreign minister, Sheikul Islam Hessein, heading a five-member Iranian delegation to Uganda to investigate the incident, said that the attack could have been the result of a navigational error or an intelligence failure. The Iranians have recently mediated a normalisation of relations between Uganda and Sudan, and in a recent peace agreement the two countries committed themselves to preventing attacks from their territories against each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement was further thrown into doubt, however, following reports on Friday that 30 people, including 28 civilians, were killed when rebels from the Lord's Resistance Army attacked Kitgum town on Wednesday. The civilians were caught in the cross fire during fighting between the army and the rebels.  The Ugandan Government claims that the LRA fighters entered the country last week from bases in Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - Following is a letter dated September 20, 1996 to His Excellency Bernard Bududira Bishop of Bururi, president, Conference des Eveques du Burundi, from the president of the National Catholic Bishops Conference in the United States,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is with great sadness that I have learned of the tragic death of our brother bishop Joachim Ruhuna, Archbishop of Gitega, Sister Concessa of the Sisters of Charity, and the other individuals who were caught in the ambush.  I offer my heartfelt condolences to you, the brother bishops of your Conference, to the families of the victims and to the faithful of the diocese.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">I join with the Holy Father in deploring this heinous murder &quot;which joins a chain of unheard of violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Ruhuna's death is a heartbreaking reminder of the urgent need for the continued pursuit of reconciliation and justice in Burundi. I pledge our Conference's continued solidarity with the Burundian bishops, and the continued support of your Conference's efforts to bring God's peace to your troubled land. I have attached, for your information, a statement which I issued in response to the archbishop's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a prayerful hope that we may never be witness to such an act of cruelty again, and that the archbishop's sacrifice may lead to dialogue and mutual understanding, I remain,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraternally your in Christ, Most Reverend Anthony M. Pilla, Bishop of Cleveland, President, NCCB/USCC</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is the text of an address by Omar Kabbaj, president of the African Development Bank (AfDB), to the Overseas Development Council on September 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is for me a pleasure and welcome opportunity to join you, President Sewell and distinguished guests, this afternoon in exchanging views on the role of the AfDB Group in African development. Our special thanks go to the Overseas Development Council not only for hosting this event, but also for the important role it plays in seeking to inform and improve the multilateral approaches and institutions that promote international development. In line with this basic objective of ODC, I will therefore take the next few minutes to share with you some ideas about the African Development Bank -- by taking up aspects of its past, present and future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AfDB Group</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you may know, the African Development Bank Group comprises mainly the Bank itself, established in 1964, which is the non-concessional window with a capital base of about US$24 billion 20($24,000 million); and the African Development Fund, the principal concessional resource affiliate, with total subscriptions of over $11 billion ($11,000 million) (before the latest Seventh Replenishment).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Agreement establishing the Bank stipulates that it shall contribute to the economic development and social progress of its regional member countries, individually and jointly. At the beginning, the membership was composed only of African countries, but today total membership stands at 77 regional and non-regional countries, with the United States as the leading non-regional shareholder, having 5.7 percent of the total voting power. Additionally, the United States accounts for some 13 percent of subscriptions to the African Development Fund (before the latest Seventh Replenishment).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These contributions have enabled the United States to work in concert with other donors in the provision of finance and technical assistance supporting development programmes in Africa. This is reinforced by the representation of the United States in the governing bodies of the Institution, which gives it a strong voice in the policies and management of the Bank Group. U.S.  participation has also enabled firms in this country to compete in the provision of goods and services for projects and programmes financed by the Bank Group. Thus, at the end of 1995, cumulative Bank Group disbursements for procurement of goods and services to non-regional country suppliers amounted to US$10.8 billion ($10,800 million); of this total, about US$765 million was made to U.S. suppliers. Clearly, therefore, the participation of the United States in the Bank Group has not only been supportive of Africa but also beneficial to U.S. business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank Group has, over the years, pursued the traditional functions of MDBs by mobilizing and deploying resources to finance projects and programmes.  In these areas, the Bank has made major strides from its modest beginnings in the 1960s so that by the end of 1995, the Bank Group had cumulatively approved over 1900 loans and grants amounting to nearly $30 billion ($30,000 million). While financing projects has constituted the primary preoccupation, the institution has, in response to the crisis of the 1980s, also been substantially engaged in policy-based operations to support reform and adjustment programmes, in close cooperation with the World Bank. For the period 1987 to date, policy-based operations have accounted for some 20 percent of Bank Group commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent Institutional Reforms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank Group, like other MDBs, has been seeking ways to enhance the quality of its operations and to foster overall development effectiveness.  For the past one year or so, specific reforms have been implemented in respect of operational quality, financial management, institutional management and organization, and overall governance and related matters. With regard to operations, the main thrust has been the implementation of an Action Plan for improving the quality of operations centering on issues of portfolio performance and lending policies and practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Country assistance strategies are now systematically guiding all lending operations which (have) fully taken into account country risk and country performance. Along with these, there has been active work to complete an overall review of the Bank Group's Portfolio. The first Annual Portfolio Performance Review Report has been considered by our Boards of Directors this month -- revealing reasonable overall performance so far, although more remains to be done. Attention has also been given to strengthening post- evaluation activities as a means of organizing and using lessons of experience in designing new projects. Consultations with other MDBs are also going on for exchanging experiences and advancing on technical methodologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to procurement of goods and services for projects funded by the Bank Group, a revamped system has been put in place to ensure complete transparency and unambiguous implementation procedures. Efforts have also been sustained to cancel non-performing loans and grants. In this regard, a major cancellation of loans and grants -- adding up to over US$2 billion ($2, 000 million) for the Bank Group over September 1995 to July 1996 -- has been concluded after extensive consultations with the borrowers. The resources so freed will be returned to the appropriate common pools for reallocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the area of financial management, emphasis has been placed on controlling loan arrears by tightening the policy on sanctions, by systematically applying directives on cancellations, and by increasing coordination with the Bretton Woods Institutions. Beyond these, recent internal studies and Board Discussions have addressed the Bank's lending rate, currency management, and net income management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the organizational side, the Bank's leaner structure put in place early this year, is now well in place. The new structure entailed the compression of supervisory posts by well over a third of the previous size; and separation, with compensation of about 20 percent of staff members. More recent efforts have been focused on efficient and transparent recruitment as well as on determination of training requirements. A number of training programmes, for example, in macro-economic analysis and environmental management, have already commenced. We are also proceeding with plans to relaunch the Young Professionals Programme to ensure renewal of staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On overall institutional governance, a Special Study on Governance and Related Issues is being considered by the Bank's Ad-Hoc Committee of Governors on the Fifth General Capital Increase. Aspects of the Study that do not require actions by Governors are already being addressed by Management and the Boards of Directors. There are other ongoing exercises relating to the review of policies and operations as well as to financial control and management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme of reforms has come a long way and received the endorsement of our shareholders, regional and non-regional -- as partly reflected in the conclusion this year, of consultations on the Seventh General Replenishment of the African Development Fund. As a result, total concessional resources amounting to about US$3.0 billion ($3,000 million) will be available to fund projects and programmes over the period 1996-98 in the low-income regional member countries. On this basis, we should be able to support a combined -- concessional and non-concessional -- annual lending programme of about US$2.5 billion ($2,500 million) over the same period. To supplement our own resources, we will step up our catalytic role by intensifying Bank Group collaboration and co-financing activities with bilateral and other multilateral development institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development and Operational Policies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Permit me to address next some issues in development policy and operations.  The current development policy priorities of the Bank Group emanate from Africa's over-arching development objectives in the 1990s. These focus on accelerating production growth, promoting human resource development, poverty reduction, and attending to the foundations of longer-term development. In furtherance of these objectives, the Bank Group would also provide support for critical cross-sectoral concerns, such as women in development, environmental management, and private sector promotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank Group accords high recognition to the central role that should be accorded to poverty reduction in the continent. Estimates by international institutions, for instance, indicate that, on current trends, while the number of poor people elsewhere in the developing world would decrease by 300 million over the fifteen years to the turn of the century, the number in low- income Africa is projected to increase by 85 million. And this situation is being exacerbated by the AIDS pandemic threatening a rising share of the population. Consequently, therefore, the Bank is evolving deliberate approaches to supporting the attack on poverty. A substantial share of Bank Group interventions (as much as 65 percent in the case of concessional resources) would be directed to projects and programmes in agriculture and the social sectors; and some programmes would be direct and targeted at poverty reduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our overall approach to poverty reduction and related issues -- like the environment -- we have been seeking cooperation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs). For as you know, NGOs have often made the greatest impact in areas like grassroot activities, gender issues, and community participation, which have eluded official development assistance. We have a policy in place to increase collaboration with NGOs. Already, the Bank has held several consultations with regional and non-regional NGOs, and a major conference is scheduled for November 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preparatory discussions have focused on issues of enhancing collaboration between the Bank and NGOs on policy concerns and other activities, especially the Bank's poverty reduction programme. We will be making further strides in this area, with the finalization of a new micro- enterprise assistance strategy which will set the framework for extending micro-credit to the poorest groups, using NGOs and other grassroot organizations. In working with NGOs and with others in the development community, we intend to systematically provide information on all relevant activities of the Bank Group -- to encourage transparency and dialogue. The Bank Group's Policy on Disclosure of Information -- including a proposal to establish an Information Centre -- is under consideration of our Boards of Directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I should also mention, in the context of poverty reduction and social development, a major issue -- the debt of the poor countries -- currently on the active agenda of the international community. We in the Bank have supported and participated in the international consultations on the issue.  Internal reflections are, therefore, under way in consultations with the Bretton Woods Institutions, on the possible options and modalities that may be applied by the Bank Group for participating in the debt initiative -- of course, subject to our own financial constraints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sustainable, the goal of poverty reduction should be linked with the pursuit of broad-based economic growth, partly through raising the investment rate. In many of the low-income countries, the investment rate is inadequate to meet replacement needs, let alone supporting new production capacity. The goal should be to lift the investment rate not only through increased mobilization of official flows, but also by tapping potentials from domestic sources, especially that coming from the private sector. Indeed, it would not at all be an exaggeration to say that achieving sustained growth would critically depend on the extent to which the private sector succeeds in mobilizing the requisite resources for investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given this importance of private investment, we have in the Bank recently revamped our private-sector strategy to emphasize the aspect of leveraging our financing by acting as catalyst and mobilizer of private capital, both domestic and international. In all these efforts, we will work closely with other financing institutions such as IFC, the World Bank, and bilateral agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five main areas of action, that are more or less being pursued also in other MDBs, will underpin our interventions. First, the Bank will assist more actively in the creation of an enabling environment beyond macroeconomic management -- participating in building up supporting institutions such as land registries, security exchanges and legal regimes that are vital for private enterprise development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, we will consolidate areas of past support by using loans and equity instruments in a more selective manner. And the Bank will seek investment opportunities in countries where enabling environments exist, as well as promote interaction between foreign and local investors so as to create enduring and profitable business relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, the Bank will seek to play a significant role in the private financing of infrastructure, including Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) schemes; and will also provide technical advice to governments on the development of the necessary legal and regulatory framework to attract private financiers for such projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth, the Bank will also play an enhanced role in assisting with privatization. In this field, too, there is need for technical assistance which we could provide. The Bank may also invest directly in the privatized companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the Bank will provide a more focused and enhanced assistance to small and medium-scale enterprises, through lines of credit to performing commercial banks and other financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chairman, private capital has a major role to play in the growth process, and we all welcome the recent encouraging trends in flows to the developing world. But as we also know, these flows have been concentrated in a few countries and have mostly shied away from the low-income ones, partly because of the weak creditworthiness and infrastructural base of such countries. For some time to come, the low-income countries would continue to rely substantially on concessional resources to finance their development programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the context of the African Development Bank Group, consideration of country creditworthiness has entailed that no less than 39 regional member countries, out of a total of 53, remain without access to our non- concessional window for sovereign loans. This means that apart from IDA and other concessional sources, support for these countries will have to come from the African Development Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we speak now, however, the contribution of the United States to the ADF- VII, although pledged, has not been approved by Congress for the coming fiscal year. We are, of course, grateful for the leadership role that has been taken by the U.S. as well as for the pledge, and are sensitive to the constraints facing the U.S. and other donors. But, given the conditions in low-income Africa, it would not be fully practical to engage in accelerating economic development, if concessional resources would not be available in magnitudes that would significantly support the attack on poverty and finance social overhead investments -- that would otherwise remain unattended. And, as we know, improvements in the economic conditions of these countries generate increased demand for the goods and services produced in U.S. and other industrial countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conclusion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's development prospects today stand at crossroads. The process of economic reforms is gaining momentum by the year as the majority of governments are embracing widening dimensions of these reforms and as domestic consensus is growing. Africa's development partners, on their part, have invested both financially and in terms of widening international consensus in what should be done to sustain recovery and development. Yet, we still face major obstacles like the inadequate external capital flows, especially to the poorer countries. These problems, however, are certainly within the abilities of the international community to resolve -- if we could all continue pulling together in the desired direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African Development Bank, as the continent's own institution, has grown to enjoy a unique confidence and trust with government and non-government bodies throughout Africa; and has generated support from development partners beyond the continent. The Bank will, of course, work closely with the World Bank and other multilateral institutions operating in Africa. It will use its locational advantage in the continent, its mostly African staff, and its Africa-specific technical and cultural knowledge to promote socioeconomic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also use its political proximity and closeness to advance policy dialogue with member governments on matters which may be sensitive but yet important for development management. And, it will as well address and assist in important developmental approaches -- like regional cooperation and integration -- that are often so important for faster growth. As a financing institution, the Bank contributes to the additionality of development resources by providing diversity and therefore the spreading of financial risk. The additional financing channel, in turn, could be used and has been used beneficially for co-financing with bilateral and multilateral institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ongoing institutional reforms I outlined earlier are placing the Bank Group on a much stronger footing to meet its mandate of supporting the development and integration of African economies. Importantly, the reforms should go a long way in efforts to ensure the development effectiveness of our operations. Recognizing the positive role of the Overseas Development Council and its friends in promoting international development, I do hope that we can count on your influence and support for Africa and the African Development Bank.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is the text of remarks on September 26 by David F.  Gordon, director of U.S. policy programs at the Overseas Development Council, before the House Subcommittee on Africa, during hearings on the Clinton administrations Africa policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to thank the Subcommittee Chair, Representative Ros-Lehtinen, and members of the Committee for inviting me to testify on the topic of the Clinton Administration's performance in Africa. This is an important topic and I commend the Chair for calling this hearing today. I am particularly pleased to be sharing the table with Ambassador Hempstone, with whom I had the great privilege to serve when he was U.S. Ambassador to Kenya. I also want to commend the Chair, the Ranking Member, Mr. Ackerman, and other members of the Committee for the diligent work of their very talented and hard-working staffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The views that I express this afternoon are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues at the Overseas Development Council or its Board of Directors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF U.S. AFRICA POLICY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent issue of the journal Foreign Policy, as an exception to his generally favorable assessment of the Clinton Administration's conduct of foreign affairs, Richard Ullman, a relatively liberal analyst, gave the Administration a failing grade for its Africa policy, with the tart comment: &quot; No Cold War = No Policy.&quot; This afternoon, my colleagues around this table, none of whom will take umbrage at the label conservative, are presenting their own critical comments concerning the Clinton Administration's Africa policy. So, the Administration's Africa policy has come under criticism from both sides of the spectrum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe that, while not without weaknesses, the Administration's performance in Africa has been basically sound. Before moving on to the details of my assessment, let me comment briefly on the context within which U.S. Africa policy operates. Several elements of the political context have been major determinants of that policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First is the peculiar limbo status of Africa in post-Cold War foreign policy. Stuck between ill-defined, but real, American interests and Africa's peripherality to U.S. strategic or vital concerns, Africa policy is inherently very tricky. Absent the Cold War framework where all regions were part of the chess board of the great game of superpower competition, determination of U.S. interests for several regions has been under dispute, but nowhere has this been more difficult than in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this context, continuing U.S. engagement in Africa has often been justified by an ever-expanding litany of &quot;new&quot; issues and threats that demand immediate American attention. Approaches to Africa by advocates of many political stripes tend to veer among absolutes -- either complete handwashing, domination by a single theme (be it the environment, democracy, or trade promotion), or massive overextension. The Administration has been generally successful in balancing disparate views and moderating extreme pressures from all camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the Administration has been inundated with immediate crises and disasters in Africa. Assistant Secretary Moose has expressed, on several occasions, frustration at his inability to focus on the larger goals of U.S.  policy because of the day-to-day crush of responding to Africa's multiple crises. The proliferation of crises has complicated efforts to articulate and implement broader conceptual themes for policy. Hopefully, Secretary Christopher's impending trip to Africa will help address this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, anti-internationalism in general and anti-Africa sentiment in particular has reared its head in the Congress. In the aftermath of the loss of U.S. lives on the streets of Mogadishu in October 1993, and especially after the 1994 election, U.S. Africa policy has been under something of a &quot; state of siege.&quot; Somalia was a watershed in encouraging congressional and public hostility toward the U.N. and toward active U.S. engagement in Africa.  A barrage of anti-internationalist pressures from the public and Congress, specific calls from Senators Helms and McConnell to substantially cut U.S.  assistance to Africa, and large cuts in the international affairs budget have left Africa policymakers on the defensive, scrambling to justify continued American involvement and to find the resources needed to support that engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this very challenging political context, on the whole the Clinton Administration record on Africa is positive. Moreover, in Africa policy, as in other areas of foreign policy, the Administration is settling onto a more steady tack after some initial rough waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- The Administration worked effectively for change in South Africa, supporting the long negotiating process, providing an ample aid package for the transition period, and working to build a broad relationship with the new South Africa based on the principle of mutual benefit and respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- It played a crucial role in reinvigorating the peace process in Angola, where we now stand on the verge of a decisive breakthrough that holds the promise of ending Africa's longest war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- It has increased pressure on the terrorist-supporting Islamic fundamentalist regime in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- It has provided strong international leadership on humanitarian relief, especially in the Horn of Africa, and has been in the driver's seat on multilateral efforts to promote Africa's own capacities for conflict resolution and peacekeeping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- It has utilized new policy instruments to foster improved human rights, the consolidation of democracy, and more effective governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Finally, the Administration has made Africa a priority within the U.S.  foreign aid program, protecting the African account from the draconian cuts taken from programs to Asia and Latin America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Administration has been somewhat less successful in some other areas:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- It has had difficulty in generating consensus and action in response to the derailing of the democratic transition in Nigeria, Africa's most populous state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Chastened by Somalia and allowing its skepticism towards the U.N. and Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali to overcome fundamental humanitarian considerations, the U.S. (as well as other countries) failed to take preventive action that might have mitigated the tragedy in Rwanda in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- While successfully defending bilateral aid, the Administration has been less successful in defending the U.S. contribution to the International Development Association, the soft-loan window of the World Bank, nearly one- half of whose resources are lent to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFRICA POLICY: THEMES AND IMPLEMENTATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support for democratization, facilitation of conflict resolution, and promotion of economic reform and sustainable development comprise the tripod of the Clinton Administration's Africa policy. These themes reflect the essential continuity of U.S. Africa policy in the post-Cold War era. The Clinton Administration has built upon efforts begun in the Bush Administration to shift U.S. Africa policy away from the negative elements of the Cold War legacy toward more positive ends. It is unfortunate that the bipartisan continuity in U.S. policy towards Africa has not been better recognized since it is a positive sign of consensus in U.S. foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. has stopped supporting dictators and military regimes in Africa.  Instead, there has been a substantial shift in American aid and attention toward countries undertaking transitions to more open political systems and freer economies. In the 1980s, much U.S. aid was wasted in Mobutu's Zaire, Sergeant Doe's Liberia, and Siad Barre's Somalia. But today, U.S. aid resources are directed to those African countries most dedicated to reform and with the best prospects for trade and investment. Among our leading recipients are South Africa, Uganda, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Mali, all of which are going through difficult &quot;dual transitions&quot; to democracy and a market economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. aid is playing an important role in facilitating the return to economic growth and stability that is occurring in most African countries.  Our assistance promotes development by facilitating better economic policies, helping to entrench democratic governance, and supporting basic human resource investments in child survival and girls' education. Partially as a result of these efforts, most African countries have growth rates of over three percent per year and U.S. exports to Africa have been growing at a rate of more than twenty percent annually for the last two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking into account the inherent difficulties involved in promoting democracy in Africa, the Clinton Administration's record is strong. As one of Africa's most astute observers, Professor Ali Mazrui, noted in testimony before this Subcommittee, &quot;the U.S. must recognize the paradox of a strong African desire for democracy combined with a fragile African capability for it.&quot; An oft-heard critique, from democracy advocates and some human rights groups, is that the Administration has failed to live up to the promises concerning democratization made in the 1992 presidential campaign. But the fact that the Administration has not made democracy promotion the be-all and end-all of its Africa policy is a sign of flexibility and maturity rather than failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Administration has signaled U.S. support for democratization by increasing aid programs in new democracies and closing down programs in countries like Cameroon and Togo, where autocrats hijacked democratic transitions. U.S. support, through training and monitoring, has been crucial in the success of &quot;transitional elections&quot; in nearly twenty African countries.  The U.S. has played an important role in all of southern Africa's democratic transitions and, as a result, has an influence in the region far in excess of the still limited formal U.S. presence and economic ties. This influence is already paying dividends for the United States. In the debate on the extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, South Africa lent its considerable moral stature to the U.S. effort to achieve an extension of the Treaty, and was a significant factor in our success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Administration has also worked to advance conflict-resolution and conflict-prevention activities in Africa. Working with members of this Committee from both parties, the Administration supported, and helped shape, the Africa Conflict Resolution Act of 1994. It has supported the efforts of the Organization of African Unity to build an indigenous capacity for conflict resolution, and is now undertaking an intense effort, along with a number of European states, to develop a strategy for enhancing the military capacity of African peacekeeping forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again working with a bipartisan group of members of Congress, the Administration is currently developing a more coordinated approach to facilitating U.S. trade and investment in Africa. The U.S. has played a significant role in promoting economic reform in Africa, and has an interest in maximizing the impact of those reforms on U.S. trade and investment. The Administration has been in intense consultations with the Africa Trade and Investment Caucus, led by Representatives Phil Crane and Jim McDermott, on a set of legislative and executive branch initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUIDEPOSTS FOR THE FUTURE: U.S. INTERESTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Chair, you asked the panelists today for suggestions on how the U.S.  should approach various issues affecting the African continent. In looking at future U.S. engagement in Africa, it is useful to begin by laying out U.S.  interests. Here we must distinguish among actual threats to national security, significant national interests, and mere aspirations. Any hard-headed analysis of Africa must conclude that, with the exception of Sudan's ties to international terrorist organizations, U.S. security concerns in Africa are marginal by any measure. But America does have real interests in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First and foremost is a humanitarian interest. Fifty years ago, in announcing post-World War II reconstruction plans, Secretary of State George Marshall committed U.S. foreign policy to a fight &quot;against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos.&quot; The geographical focus of that fight shifted over the years, from Europe in the late 1940s, to Latin America, and then to Asia.  Today, the focal point for America's spirit of generosity must be Africa.  Although famine and the dire crises Americans readily associate with Africa are in fact rare, Africa remains the world's poorest, least educated, and least healthy region. Indeed, recent polls suggest that public support is strongest for American aid and intervention abroad for humanitarian reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also have economic interests in Africa. Despite the low level of existing commerce, Africa remains a huge potential untapped market for U.S.  trade and investment. Economic opportunities in Africa have improved dramatically in the past several years. The ideological climate in Africa has shifted to a remarkable degree with almost every country at least moving in the right direction of economic reform. Africa boasts more than a dozen active stock markets (with at least five more in the works) and many countries have liberalized their investment codes and begun to attract substantial investment, most notably Ghana, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, U.S. exports to Africa increased by over twenty percent, and recently released Commerce Department figures show that this expansion has continued in the first half of this year. South Africa, because of its sheer economic size and regional domination, is already an important economic partner. On the investment side, numerous Africa-related funds, touting the continent as the &quot;final frontier,&quot; have sprung up in some of the world's biggest investment houses, including Morgan Stanley, Baring Brothers, and Alliance Capital. We need to keep in mind that it was not so long ago that countries in Latin America and Asia that are now lucrative markets for U.S.  trade and investment were considered hopeless, much of the way that Africa is perceived today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several transnational issues directly affect the United States and can only be adequately addressed through bilateral and multilateral cooperation with African partners. The lesson from the battle against smallpox and AIDS is that global efforts are necessary to wipe out some public health threats.  International drug trafficking and crime syndicates are a rising problem that can only effectively be dealt with through cooperative efforts. The U.S. also has a substantial interest in preventing the further expansion of drug and crime networks in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the African-American community wants the U.S. to be engaged in Africa. The end of the Cold War has made regional and issue-specific constituencies increasingly influential in U.S. foreign policy. Such ethnic influence in foreign policy has a long history in American politics and is certainly well within the American tradition. A successful foreign policy must reflect and incorporate the views, values, and concerns of all segments of American society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROMOTING U.S. INTERESTS: SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM APPROACHES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Cold War, the central policy debate concerning Africa was between those who favored a short-term approach based on Cold War calculations and those who proposed a long-term strategy based on fostering more rapid economic growth and development. In 1987, Congress put its weight decisively behind the latter approach by creating the Development Fund for Africa (DFA). But, as long as the Cold War continued, a long-term approach based on the development paradigm could never prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past few years a new, and largely unaddressed, tension has emerged between long-term and short-term involvement. On the one hand, the underlying logic of the DFA legislation remains valid. Encouraging and supporting &quot; development&quot; -- social, political, and especially economic -- is the basic long-term strategy for attaining many, indeed most, of the United States' goals in Africa. On the other hand, events on the ground in Africa and political pressures at home have pushed U.S. Africa policy into a much more short-term mode. To some extent, this is unavoidable and appropriate. Yet, the increasing pressures for immediate response, combined with the insistence by NGOs and many in the Congress that U.S. development assistance efforts focus on child-survival and other immediate social expenditures, threaten to take the U.S. &quot;out of the game&quot; of long-term development. We need to restore a balance between short-term and long-term approaches in order to effectively promote U.S. interests in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: The Short Term: Criteria for Crisis Intervention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many African countries, it clearly makes little sense to think long- term as they face political, economic, or social crises. The U.S. clearly has a role in these situations in providing humanitarian and emergency assistance, but the question is how can the U.S. decide where and when to act, beyond emergency relief, in crisis or potential-crisis situations? The cold realities are that in most instances the U.S. will not be able to successfully engage or intervene. But there are a number of cases where the U.  S. will not be able (to), and should not, disengage. What specific criteria justify intervention?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- The first is large states that hold the key to regional stability. This would only include a few countries, most notably Nigeria and Zaire (as well as Kenya and South Africa, should a major crisis arise). While the disintegration of the Togolese state would be a tragedy for Togo, it would have no regional implications and pressure for external assistance would fall into the lap of the intimately engaged French. But the collapse of Nigeria into chaos or civil war would likely have regional repercussions that could unleash waves of instability and mass migration throughout West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Second are countries where the U.S. has significant economic interests.  Again, this would involve only a very limited number of countries, with Angola and Nigeria being the two obvious cases due to the vast quantities of oil we import from them. The United States annually purchases over $5 billion ($5,000 million) of Nigerian oil and $2 billion ($2,000 million) from Angola.  Major American companies, including Mobil, Chevron, Exxon, and Texaco, have significant production and exploration interests in those two countries, with total U.S. private investment topping $6 billion ($6,000 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Third are countries with close historic ties to the United States, in which there is a broad consensus within the international community and in Africa that the U.S. is the relevant dominant external power. Only Liberia and Ethiopia fall into this category. Decisive American engagement in Ethiopia in 1991 was crucial in facilitating the stable political transition following that country's civil war. Unfortunately, the failure of the U.S. to take decisive action at several key moments has been one reason why the Liberian conflict has been so difficult to end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Finally, given the American humanitarian tradition, the U.S. should not ignore crises where, barring international action, large numbers of people face imminent death. While the defining lines would necessarily be fuzzy, in instances of impending mass starvation (Somalia in 1992) or genocide (Rwanda in 1994 and Burundi today), policymakers should be prepared for such contingencies. Simply reacting to emotional public outbursts is no basis for policy. It must be recognized that massive intervention can be dangerous, costly, and fraught with unforeseen complications. But, despite the risks, there will sometimes be no alternative to intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In countries that fall within one of these four categories, the U.S. must be willing to undertake serious diplomatic efforts and to commit both real resources and/or impose real costs in order to invigorate such diplomacy. In this regard, often the U.S. will need to work with other major powers and shape and support United Nations initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B: The Long Term: Focused Support for Development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Successful development will be the long-term key for preventing crises, addressing humanitarian concerns, and taking advantage of economic opportunities. While most of the important challenges and problems facing Africa -- managing ethnic diversity, controlling the population explosion, creating effective and stable polities, promoting higher rates of economic growth -- do not threaten the U.S. directly, there will be costs to the United States should they fail to be successfully addressed. In that context, the interests that the United States does have in Africa -- avoiding human suffering and the need for large-scale emergency relief, developing markets for American products, addressing global health, drug, and crime problems, preventing breeding grounds for international terrorism -- will be much harder, and probably impossible, to achieve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is that the prospects for development in Africa, and the ability of international assistance to facilitate development, have never been better. A number of long-standing conflicts have been resolved, misguided experiments with socialism have been abandoned, and a new generation of highly competent political and economic managers now occupy senior roles in most countries. Some twenty-five Africa countries are moving forward, if in many cases slowly, on economic reform and democratization and/or national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, within Africa a broad consensus has emerged on a strategy for development that is consistent with U.S. interests. This strategy emphasizes the following themes: first, the importance of effective macro-economic management; second, the need to promote the market and private sector as the engine of economic growth; third, the centrality of sustainable investment in basic education and health; fourth, the continuing need to reduce the rate of population growth; and fifth, the importance of strengthening the institutional underpinnings for development, both within the government and in the non-governmental sectors. At the center of the new consensus is the belief that while external assistance can be helpful, the primary impetus for development can only come from within.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can the United States best support this agenda?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, by continuing to support the International Development Association (IDA), the soft-loan window of the World Bank. IDA resources remain central to both the ongoing process of economic policy reform and to the vast bulk of major investment activities ranging from human resource development through improved basic health and education, the expansion of the financial systems, and the rehabilitation and construction of basic infrastructure needed for economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, by ensuring that as African countries recover economically and begin to increase their exports, they do not run into restrictive trade barriers. Particularly problematic are the rules of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, in which a percentage increase in a country's exports to the U.S.  within each category of textile goods automatically triggers a quota response. African countries are starting from such a low base that even modest success can provoke such a quota, as the U.S. recently slapped on Kenyan textile exports. Although such incidents are rare and relatively minor today, as Africa grows, these barriers may become more onerous in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, by better concentrating bilateral assistance both substantively and geographically. American bilateral programs should be concentrated in those countries showing strong commitments to private-sector-based development, effective human resource investments, improved governance, liberalization of their political sphere, and respect for international human rights norms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Substantively, U.S. assistance programs should focus on key areas in which the U.S. has a comparative advantage, which are high priorities within the African development consensus, and which will serve to create a broader range of economic linkages between the U.S. and Africa. Existing U.S. aid programs are spread too thin and in some ways lag behind the current African consensus.  They often pay too little attention to the opportunities that exist for promoting expanded trade and investment ties between the U.S. and Africa, and are increasingly looking away from programs aimed at improving governmental performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reformed U.S. bilateral aid program in Africa should focus in four areas: first, reducing population growth rates through provision of family planning services and better child and maternal health care; second, improving governance by strengthening the capacity of African governments and enhancing non-governmental voices; third, promoting more dynamic microenterprise development to unleash the latent talents of Africa's hidden entrepreneurs and create expanded employment opportunities; and fourth, developing an African trade and investment partnership that will both provide a stimulus for economic growth in Africa and deepen the trade linkages between U.S.  firms and 600 million potential consumers of American goods in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the crisis-ridden political context within which it has had to operate, the Clinton team's overall record in Africa is positive. By emphasizing the areas that I have highlighted, the next Administration, whether led by President Clinton or Senator Dole, can do even a better job of focusing policy in more deliberate ways and best serve U.S. interests in Africa into the next century.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is testimony by Walter Kansteiner, senior associate at The Forum for International Policy, in a September 26 hearing before the House Subcommittee on Africa, during hearings on the Clinton administrations Africa policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past 10 years, U.S. policy towards Africa has focused on a few core issues -- conflict resolution, political reform, and economic and commercial development being the dominant concerns. The Clinton Administration has not differed from previous administrations. It too has articulated its policies based upon these three central issues. Resolving conflict, encouraging democratic political institutions, and building a strong economy are interlinked, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This testimony is a very brief attempt at examining the Administration's policies and performance on economic and commercial issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a somewhat slow start, the Clinton Administration realized that Africa has commercial potential. With U.S.-Africa trade increasing and direct foreign investment growing substantially, the Administration began searching for ways to promote U.S.-Africa commercial activity. Last year trade with Africa grew 12 percent to $18 billion ($18,000 million). U.S. exports to Africa were about on the same level as our exports to Eastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Direct equity investment has also been expanding. U.S. companies now have as much invested in South Africa alone as they have in Turkey, Israel, or India. (It is interesting to note that the average return on investment in African holdings is 28 percent -- far higher than the 8.5 percent worldwide average.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These impressive economic statistics helped encourage the Clinton Administration to organize a White House Conference on Africa in June 1994.  The message from this conference was on target as senior officials discussed the importance of supporting a strong private-sector throughout Africa. And U.  S. corporations were encouraged to seek out African trading partners, and to look for investment opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference, however, was followed by very little concrete support, but for one important exception, the late Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown. In his three years in office Ron Brown averaged two trips per year to Africa. He led commercial missions, he pushed for greater trade, he encouraged U.S.  companies to invest in Africa. But most importantly he diplomatically but forcefully explained to African leaders that they had to get their economic houses in order if they wanted to succeed in attracting investment dollars.  Ron Brown's voice was heard, and he helped both the African states as well as American companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, since his death, the Commerce Department does not seem to have the same level of interest or energy in pursuing his initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton Administration has also attempted to encourage business contacts with programs such as the U.S.-South Africa Binational Commission, which has a business council component.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These limited efforts at supporting commercial activity between the U.S.  and Africa have been quite helpful. But the next administration, whether Democrat or Republican, should begin to consider how the U.S. can influence, persuade, cajole, and push African states towards more aggressive free market economic policies. The U.S. voice in Africa carries far, and we need to demonstrate our commitment to a strong private sector throughout the continent. African governments have long dominated their own economies and their country's commercial activity. But if Africa is to prosper, governments must give up the reins of economic power and release the private sector from excessive regulations and restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privatizing state-owned companies is an important first step in taking governments out of critical commercial sectors. Often, African political leaders are reluctant to carry out privatization programs. But privatization of state assets is the most efficient way of transforming equity structures and making these companies preform on a commercial basis. The U.S. government must support privatization efforts, bilaterally, as well as through the international financial institutions like the World Bank, IMF, and African Development Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next Administration must also focus on the region's most likely economic success story -- southern Africa. Along with the rest of the world, the current Administration has thoroughly enjoyed the success of Nelson Mandela's new South African government. But the honeymoon is over, South Africa and the southern African region must make some tough economic decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Africa has a population of about 125 million; it is a region that has excellent resources and commercial infrastructure. It could develop internal trading patterns that would benefit all of the countries in the region. What is desperately needed is some type of free-trade agreement or structure. The U.S. government should be actively encouraging the region's political and commercial leaders in discussing and building plans for a Southern Africa Free Trade Zone. Perhaps the nucleus institutions already exist with the South African Customs Union and SADC (Southern African Development Community). But the next administration could assist in building an African economic institution that would have long-term commercial benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next administration needs to continue the hands-on type commercial activity that Ron Brown actively pursued. But it also must become engaged in helping African countries take the right steps toward building private-sector- dominated economies. Our active participation in privatization processes, either bilaterally or via international financial institutions, is critical.  We must also become involved in helping Africans formulate economic strategies that appear overwhelming, like a Southern African Free Trade Zone, yet are absolutely necessary if Africa is to become economically viable in the next century.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rossi was speaking in Lusaka today when he presented to Tourism Minister Gabriel Maka, the Africa Travels Association (ATA) award given to Zambia for outstanding leadership in the tourism industry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambia lacked a proper information system that would provide information to tourists within and outside Zambia. There was need to create an information system that would include some magazines,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the private sector in the tourism industry should also cooperate with government to strengthen the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rossi who received the prize on behalf of Zambia recently in Namibia said the award showed that Zambia's tourism industry was recognised by many internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said ATA is based in New York and deals with tourists travelling to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr Maka paid tribute to ATA and concurred with Mr Rossi that tourism enterprises should cooperate among themselves and government ministries to boost tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said tour operators should present their personal complaints to the ministry of tourism through their respective associations and not individually as was the case at present.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZPTF fund manager, Abdul Munshi, in an interview yesterday, said they had re-issued more shares to the public in addition to the 328 million shares.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign applications had to be scaled down by 80 per cent to give Zambians first priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the share allocation, a total of 56.4 million shares have been secured by individual Zambians while local institutional investors acquired 104.5 million shares. Off-shore investors - institutional and individuals - secured 185.5 million shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Munshi further disclosed that the remaining three per cent Zambia Sugar Plc shares in the custody of ZPTF would released on the secondary market later, depending on favourable market conditions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Panic-stricken Mozambique Football Association (MFA) officials have warned their new coaching staff that they will be fired should Mozambique lose to Zambia in this Sunday's Africa Cup of Nations match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;endangered&quot; new coaching staff took over after MFA fired Portugues Rui Casador only months after he replaced Ukranian Viktor Bonderenko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The coaching staff has been told in no uncertain terms that they will be fired should Mozambique lose against Zambia,&quot; a reliable source said in an interview yesterday, advising: &quot;Zambia should be careful as they (Mozambique) will take the game very seriously.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panic in the Moza-mbiquan camp was further heightened when the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) disclosed last week that all Zambia's professional players, including inspirational skipper Kalusha Bwalya, would be available for the weekend game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the source, the news sent stand-in coach, Arnaldo Salvado, scuttling around for the services of aging Chiquino Conde, currently plying his trade with Portugal's Sporting Lisbon, Mateus Tchaka Tchaka of Boavista in Portugal and another player identified only as Jojo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was total panic when they heard that Kalusha Bwalya and the other professionals were coming for this weekend's game,&quot; the source disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But things seem not to be working for the Mamba's as they are reportedly having difficulties in getting their European-based players as they are said to be tied down with their club programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Second Secretary at the Mozambique High Commission in Lusaka, Jose Antonio Matsinha, said in an interview yesterday that all the professionals will be available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are expecting a delegation comprising 25 people,&quot; Matsinha said. &quot;All the professionals are coming. From Portugal we are expecting Chiquinho, Jojo, Tchaka Tchaka and from South Africa, we are expecting Tico Tico, Cashela and Nuro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, declined to be drawn into discussing the outcome of the game opting instead to say: &quot;let's wait until after the game&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matsina, who comfirmed that the Mamba's will be arriving today, disclosed that the team has just returned from Oman where they had a series of friendlies against that country's national team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salvado is coach for Ferraoviario de Maputo, the team that eliminated Zamsure in the CAF cup last year via a 2-1 defeat in the second round after a one-all draw.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambeef and Colcom, two Zambian businesses engaged in the beef industry, have approached the Zambia National Farmers' Union(ZNFU) with the intention of setting up a modern meat processing plant in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two companies are targeting the quality processed meat market held by South Africa and Zimbabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, Zambia is importing quality processed beef sold in supermarkets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the latest issue of ZNFU publication, The Zambian Farmer, the two companies are considering importing carcasses or live animals from Zimbabwe for processing and slaughtering here in the initial stages of the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the union is still weighing the advantages of a declining import quota system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Zambian beef producers will soon be able to benefit from exports to Mozambique, arranged by the Beef Cattle Producers Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the union, the BCPAZ has been talking to the Red Meat Producers Association of South Africa and it is hoped that a bilateral trade agreement will be reached that would allow at least a limited amount of Zambian beef onto the South Africa market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association is also looking into the supply of long weaners to Mozambique, having managed to negotiate higher prices than the local market would pay. They expect to export more than 100 heifers a month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda, on Thursaday told parliament that the new Constitution has already been enacted into law and &quot;the matter is closed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kunda, however, contends that under the current Constitution, &quot;the presidential term is tied up with the life of the National Assembly&quot;, meaning President Frederick Chiluba may continue ruling up to November 29, 1996 when Parliament is scheduled to dissolve by operation of law and effluxion of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, according to Kunda, is a departure from the old Article 38 (1) in the 1991 Constitution, which required that presidential elections are held before the expiry of the five year presidential term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kunda also pointed out that another major flaw in the new Constitution is the provision in Article 88 (9) which presupposes that after Parliament is dissolved, the president can still recall a dissolved National Assembly owing to a state of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is, if the presidential term comes to an end by virtue of Article 38 ( by reason of the dissolution of the National Assembly), how can such a President ( who is no longer president) recall a dissolved National Assembly?&quot; Kunda asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kunda is also not happy with Article 38 (2) in the new Constitution which provides for the vice-president, or a member of the cabinet elected by the cabinet, to take over the performance of presidential functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This provision, would appear to contradict Article 45 (2) of the same Constitution in that the vice-president in terms of Article 45 (2) is appointed by the President from among members of the National Assembly.  Members of cabinet are also appointed from members of the National Assembly (Article 46 (1) ). Hence if the National Assembly is dissolved, where does the vice-president or any cabinet member, who is part of the same dissolved National Assembly, get his legitimacy to rule the country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Again, how can the vice-president or member of cabinet, take over the performance of presidential functions, if the appointer (the President) has ceased to hold office by virtue of the dissolution of the National Assembly?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LAZ chairman also contends that in view of Article 45 (3) which provides that the vice-president shall vacate that office upon the assumption by any person of the office of the President, there is no justification for the vice-president to perform presidential functions after the dissolution of the National Assembly, since such dissolution also terminates the presidential term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Again how can you refer to a member of cabinet, when there is no cabinet?  From which cabinet will such a minister be elected from, to perform presidential functions and which cabinet members will elect him?&quot; Kunda asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, opposition UNIP's publicity secretary, Bweendo Mulengela, stres- sed that &quot;come October 31, Chiluba should not be at State House&quot; while Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) President, Alfred Zulu, said &quot;Midnight of November 2, 1996 is the maximum period&quot; for President Chiluba to stay at State House.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Chuulu Kalima, Zambia Democratic Congress chairman of the Lands Committee, on Sunday tore up a pamphlet used by the lands ministry in explaining the Land Act, calling it &quot;a mere piece of propaganda&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalima was speaking on ZNBC's Open Fire , television programme on Sunday evening which was discussing the 1995 Land Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is shameful to see senior civil servants, government officers, using this piece of party propaganda to explain the Land Act,&quot; Kalima charged, adding that the information was not worth the paper it was written on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants from the opposition, who included Michael Chileshe from UNIP, Leslie Zulu from the Liberal Progressive Front, Ludwig Sondashi from the National Party, criticised the MMD for not consulting the people - especially - the chiefs before enacting it into law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalima, a former lands minister in the MMD government, explained that at the time he went around the country to introduce the bill, majority of the people in rural areas were opposed to it because it was bad law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sondashi said that if his party came to power it would, within a short time, repeal the Act and bring back to what it was before so that chiefs could have a bigger say in customary land affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sondashi said that negotiations over land sales should be between the buyer and the seller and there should be little interference from the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I want to sell land to my neighbour, we should be able to agree between the two of us instead of going to ask for consent which opens loopholes for bribing government officers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sondashi explained that land was a very sensitive issue which needed to be handled with care unlike in the present case where villagers holding traditional land had now been turned into squatters on their own land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But MMD deputy national secretary, deputy minister without portifolio Paul Tembo, defended his party, saying it had provided for customary land under the new Land Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembo said chiefs had been given the rights to administer their land and maintained that the ruling party had delivered what it had promised in their manifesto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kalima accused Tembo of having not read the Land Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think Tembo has read this document. The President has got all title to land. It belongs to him and it is up to him to grant it to whosoever he wishes. That is what we are talking about,&quot; Kalima said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Strange as it may sound, President Chiluba and the current National Assembly have constitutional mandate to stay in office for the next five years. And there may not be elections in Zambia this year, after all.  Wait, before you cut me off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the furore of the citizenship clauses arguments, some clauses may have slipped past our legal minds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's reason from the following questions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When and how does this National Assembly's term end?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When and how does President Chiluba's term end?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Can the President or Parliament do anything to prolong their terms?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. How soon can elections be held after dissolution of National Assembly?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current National Assembly was elected October 31, 1991 under the 1991 Constitution which stated that their term of office was five years. By the 1991 Constitution, the current National Assembly's term ends on or about October 31, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the 1991 Constitution is no longer in effect. On May 28, 1996, when President Chiluba assented, the 1996 Constitution became the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In enacting the 1996 Constitution, the National Assembly made provision for continuity of the office bearers. While Article 9 states that any person who, under the law amended, would have been required to vacate his office at the expiration of any period or on the attainment of any age shall vacate his office at the expiration of that period or upon the attainment of that age, Article 10 of 1996 Constitution provides different notion for the National Assembly: It states that &quot; the existing National Assembly shall be the National Assembly during the period beginning on the commencement of this Act and ending on the date set for the holding of elections to the office of President and the National Assembly under the Constitution as amended&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so when is this date set for elections? The 1996 Constitution is not clear. Article 88 states that the National Assembly: &quot;(a) shall, unless sooner dissolved, continue for five years from the date of its first sitting after the commencement of this Constitution or after any dissolution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this mean that the current National Assembly has five more years, since its first sitting after commencement of the 1996 Constitution was a few weeks ago? From a layman's assumption, I believe it to be so. And I fear this was either a genuine error or a deliberate loophole for a reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the President, Article 34 of the 1996 Constitution states that: (2) An election to the office of President shall be held whenever the National Assembly is dissolved and otherwise as provided by Article 38. Article 38 says: (1) If the office of the President becomes vacant by reason of his death or resignation or by reason of his ceasing to hold office by virtue of Article 36, 37, or 88, an election to the office of President shall be held in accordance with Article 34 within ninety days from the date of the office becoming vacant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 36 deals with Removal of President on grounds of incapacity while Article 37 deals with impeachment of President for violation of Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba is not in danger of losing office due to grounds of incapacity or impeachment for violation of constitution. He also does not look like he wants to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the only reason, his office would become vacant would be by dissolution of Parliament or at the end of his term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 35 deals with Tenure of office of President and says every President shall hold office for a period of five years unless he resigns, dissolves Parliament or is incapacitated. But when did Chiluba's five-year mandate start and when will it end?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He took office on November 2, 1991 for a five-year term but did the1996 Constitution change that? It appears so. Article 8 which provides for Continuation in office of President states that: &quot;The person holding the office of President immediately before the commencement of this Act shall, unless he ceases to hold office by virtue of the provisions of Article 34 or 35 of the Constitution or resigns, continue in office and shall exercise the executive powers of the President under the Constitution as amended until the person elected at the first election to the office of President under the Constitution as amended assumes office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can President Chiluba hold on to power past this year? Yes, so long the National Assembly has not been dissolved. This bring us to the question No. 3.  - prolonging the terms of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1996 Constitution gives the President option to prolong his term in office by extending the term of the current National Assembly. Article 88 (5) states that &quot;The President may at any time prorogue Parliament.&quot; This section does not give a limit on how long he can prorogue (discontinue or prolong) the meetings of parliament without dissolving it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution does not also state under which conditions he can use this power. It's all up to the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President can also postpone elections under a state of emergency. The brewing tensions between UNIP and MMD may be reason enough for him to declare a state of emergency. Also if there's an uproar over the treason trial outcome, the President can use that to declare a state of emergency and delay elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even if the current National Assembly's term ends on October 31, and it is dissolved, there will not be enough time to hold elections in 1996. The three-months requirement would mean that elections are held during the rainy season and that would compound the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, since only Parliament can change the constitution, President Chiluba can delay elections by conceding to demands to change the constitution and it will take National Assembly several sessions and months to change the 1996 Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, don't hold your breath about elections this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There might not be any. And the sad thing is it might not be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">God, I pray, my conclusions are wrong!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - This is number 28 (23 - 29 September 1996) in a series of weekly reports from IRIN on general developments in the Great Lakes region. Sources for the information below include UN agencies, NGOs, other international organisations and media reports. IRIN issues these reports for the benefit of the humanitarian community, but accepts no responsibility as to the accuracy of the original sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee (RSCC) held its second meeting in Kigali, Rwanda on Wednesday and said that Pierre Buyoya, leader of Burundi's regime, should be &quot;available&quot; for the next regional summit. Noting the 'positive steps' taken by the regime towards meeting the conditions set out by the Arusha II summit, the Committee emphasized that the 'most important condition yet to be fully met is the immediate and unconditional negotiations with all groups.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Other leaders of parties to the conflict' may also be invited to to the next regional summit, according to the RSCC statement. This is thought to include Leonard Nyangoma, leader of the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), whose armed wing, the FDD, is fighting within Burundi. The Committee decided that sanctions 'have so far been effective' and will stay in place, although fertilizer and vegetable seeds have been exempted from the embargo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No date has been set for the proposed third regional summit, but preparations for this will take place at a Ministerial meeting to be held on 10 October, and the summit, at the Heads of State level, is expected to follow soon afterwards. The next meeting of the RSCC will take place in Arusha, Tanzania, on 8 October. The full RSCC statement is available from IRIN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RSCC's decision to invite Major Buyoya to the next regional summit was welcomed by Jean-Luc Ndizeye, his spokesman, as &quot;a very good step, but a small step.&quot; Ndizeye again called for the total lifting of the sanctions, saying that &quot;the embargo is killing any chances of peace in Burundi&quot;.  Buyoya's spokesman would not comment on the part of the statement inviting leaders of other parties to the conflict to attend the next summit, saying only &quot;we will analyse the issue when the time comes.&quot; On 22 September Pierre Buyoya had said in an interview with the East African newspaper that he was &quot; ready to start negotiations with armed factions&quot; but that &quot;on the other side they are not ready&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope John Paul II on Wednesday called for the sanctions to be eased, saying they are &quot;creating a greater burden for the civilian population&quot;. His remarks came at the end of his weekly general audience when making a tribute to Burundian Archbishop Joachim Ruhuna, who died in an ambush on 9 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The power struggle within FRODEBU intensified on Wednesday with 34 party activists in Nairobi declaring their support for Leonard Nyangoma, leader of the CNDD. Their declaration followed Mr Nyangoma's announcement on 19 September that he had taken over the party's presidency from former parliamentary speaker Jean Minani. This had been rejected by Mr Minani and by Augustin Nzojibwami, the secretary-general of FRODEBU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nzojibwami was one of five FRODEBU officials reported last week to have left the German ambassador's residence in Bujumbura, where they had taken refuge. Mr Nzojibwami said that they had left their refuge to fill the vacuum in which Mr Nyangoma had made his announcement. He claimed FRODEBU would need to hold a party congress to turn its policy away from &quot;non-violence and consensus&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The town of Bukavu in South Kivu, Zaire, was reported calm at the end of the week after Zaire and Rwanda agreed on a ceasefire following exchanges of mortar fire on Sunday 22 September, Monday and Tuesday. Both Governments accused the other of having started the shelling, which killed at least one Zairean and injured five others on Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean version of events is that the exchange of fire first began on the Sunday after prisoners escaped from the central prison in Cyangugu, Rwanda. The Rwandese Patriotic Army was said to have shot at them as well as some Zairean soldiers near the border. The Zaireans claim that this was when they began firing at Rwanda. The Rwandans claim, however, that the shelling was started by Zaire. A ceasefire was negotiated on Tuesday, but on Wednesday the deputy governor of South Kivu, Lwabandji Lwasi, accused the Rwandans of breaking it by firing shots over the border. No further incidents have been reported since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The insecurity prompted the United Nations to relocate 23 'non-essential' expatriate aid agency personnel to Nairobi on Tuesday. The International Federation of the Red Cross also evacuated three of its seven delegates in Bukavu after two shells landed in the garden of a hotel where IFRC staff were staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shelling between Rwanda and Zaire reflects growing tension between the two countries following accusations by the Zairean authorities that the RPA have been training Banyamulenge near Uvira, South Kivu, and encouraging them to destabilise eastern Zaire, using Burundi as a rear base. This claim has been categorically rejected by the Governments of Rwanda and Burundi.  Meanwhile, a UN Special Envoy of the Secretary- General, Ibrahima Fall, arrived in Kinshasa on 22 September to seek clarification on Zairean allegations that UNHCR had provided logistic support to armed groups infiltrating from Zaire and Rwanda. The charge was categorically rejected by the UN Secretary-General on 17 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge are Zairean Tutsis who migrated from Rwanda into Zaire over several centuries and who say they have been targetted in recent months by the Zairean Army and authorities. According to reports from a Banyamulenge spokesman in exile, the Zairean authorities executed 40 Banyamulenge held in detention on Sunday 22 September. This was said to have been in retaliation for the killings of Zairean soldiers by Banyamulenge militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction: IRIN would like a correct a factual error in last week's Weekly Roundup (22.9.96). In a section on accusations against the local authorities in Uvira by Amnesty International the District Commissioner was named incorrectly. A subsequent Amnesty statement corrected this to Shweka Mutabazi.  We apologize for any misunderstandings which may have arisen from this error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) agreed on Wednesday to postpone the trial of Georges Rutaganda, suspected of genocide and crimes against humanity, until 6 March 1997 on grounds of ill health. Mr Rutaganda is accused of being the second vice-president of the Interahamwe militia and of having played a leading role in the genocide. The court rejected, however, a request by Rutaganda's defence counsel that he be allowed to go to Europe for treatment of his illness, saying that he was receiving adequate care in a local civilian hospital in Arusha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Luc de Temmerman, the defence counsel, nor the court have revealed what illness he is suffering from, but Mr de Temmerman claimed that &quot;if he is not treated in Europe, he won't be there in March to be tried&quot;. Meanwhile, the ICTR accepted on Friday a prosecution request that names of witnesses should not be disclosed to the public on security grounds. Yakob Haile Mariam, prosecting counsel, said one witness in Rwanda had already been told she would be killed if she went to Tanzania to testify against Mr Rutaganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICTR began the trial last week of Jean-Paul Akayesu, the former mayor of Taba in central Rwanda, also accused of having played a major role in the genocide. Before the trial got underway, African Rights, the London-based human rights organisation, released a report detailing Akayesu's actions during the genocide and showing that he 'went to extraordinary lengths to ensure the wholesale slaughter of Tutsis in his commune'. The full report is available from IRIN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial of Akayesu, however, has also been postponed - this time for one month. Johan Scheers, his defence counsel, threatened on Friday to resign unless the court granted his request for a postponement of the case, saying that he had been given insufficient time to prepare his case. On Thursday the ICTR was also attacked by the Governments of Rwanda and Zimbabwe for slow progress since its establishment. They accused the UN of racial bias, saying that the Tribunal had acted more quickly to bring Bosnian war criminals to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The UNHCR announced on Tuesday that it was excluding from refugee status 20 Rwandans indicted by the International Tribunal in connection with the genocide. The list includes people who are currently being held in Arusha as well as others known to be in Europe and in refugee camps and elsewhere in Africa. The UNHCR is urging Governments not to provide those listed with asylum. They are: Ignace Bagilishema, Charles Sikubwabo, Aloys Ndimbati, Vincent Rutaganira, Mika Muhimana, Ryandikayo, Obed Ruzindana, Clement Kayishema, Jean-Paul Akayesu, Georges Rutaganda, Alfred Musema, Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, Gerard Ntakirutimana, Andre Ntagerura, Ladislas Ntaganzwa, Anatole Nsengiyumva, Elie Ndayambaje, Ferdinand Nahimana, Theoneste Bagosora and Eliezer Niyitegeka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The South African Government has been criticized by South African human rights groups, arms officials and politicians for its decision on Thursday to approve private sales of weapons to Rwanda. The decision has predictably been criticized by the RDR (Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda), the umbrella organisation representing Rwandan refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Rwanda's Ambassador to France, Christophe Mfizi, resigned from his post on Tuesday according to media reports. The embassy did not say why Mfizi, who was appointed to Paris in March 1995, had resigned. The first secretary, Modeste Rutabayiru, will temporarily replace him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Human Rights Watch and the Federation Internationale de Ligues des Droits de L'Homme called on Monday for the International Tribunal to investigate and prosecute rape and other gender-related crimes. The ICTR has to date issued no indictments for rape or other forms of sexual violence. The call followed the release of an HRW/FIDH report entitled, 'Shattered Lives: Sexual Violence During the Rwandan Genocide and its Aftermath', which details 'horrific' attacks on women and their families during the genocide. HRW/FIDH's recommendations included a call on donors to ensure that aid programmes meet women's needs, especially in the areas of criminal justice, health care, housing, credit, education, vocational training and trauma conselling, and on the Government of Rwanda to improve coordination between ministries seeking to issues relating to women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Some 284 people were killed in Rwanda in August according to a report by the UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) released on Wednesday.  HRFOR blamed the RPA for 159 of these deaths, while responsibility for the other killings lay with Hutu rebels who continued to target local officials and survivors of the genocide. The prison population reached 81,300 at the end of August, an increase of 2,800 since July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The peace agreement between the Ugandan and Sudanese Governments came under strain last week after the Sudanese Government all but admitted having bombed northern Uganda on Sunday 22 September. On Monday Amama Mbabazi, Uganda's Minister of Defence, had said that two Sudanese MiG planes dropped bombs aimed at the army barracks in Moyo on Sunday 22 September, but missed their target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese Government at first denied the claim, but later admitted that the attack had taken place. Iran's deputy foreign minister, Sheikul Islam Hessein, heading a five-member Iranian delegation to Uganda to investigate the incident, said that the attack could have been the result of a navigational error or an intelligence failure. The Iranians have recently mediated a normalisation of relations between Uganda and Sudan, and in a recent peace agreement the two countries committed themselves to preventing attacks from their territories against each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement was further thrown into doubt, however, following reports on Friday that 30 people, including 28 civilians, were killed when rebels from the Lord's Resistance Army attacked Kitgum town on Wednesday. The civilians were caught in the cross fire during fighting between the army and the rebels.  The Ugandan Government claims that the LRA fighters entered the country last week from bases in Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is with great sadness that I have learned of the tragic death of our brother bishop Joachim Ruhuna, Archbishop of Gitega, Sister Concessa of the Sisters of Charity, and the other individuals who were caught in the ambush.  I offer my heartfelt condolences to you, the brother bishops of your Conference, to the families of the victims and to the faithful of the diocese.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">I join with the Holy Father in deploring this heinous murder &quot;which joins a chain of unheard of violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Ruhuna's death is a heartbreaking reminder of the urgent need for the continued pursuit of reconciliation and justice in Burundi. I pledge our Conference's continued solidarity with the Burundian bishops, and the continued support of your Conference's efforts to bring God's peace to your troubled land. I have attached, for your information, a statement which I issued in response to the archbishop's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a prayerful hope that we may never be witness to such an act of cruelty again, and that the archbishop's sacrifice may lead to dialogue and mutual understanding, I remain,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is the text of an address by Omar Kabbaj, president of the African Development Bank (AfDB), to the Overseas Development Council on September 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is for me a pleasure and welcome opportunity to join you, President Sewell and distinguished guests, this afternoon in exchanging views on the role of the AfDB Group in African development. Our special thanks go to the Overseas Development Council not only for hosting this event, but also for the important role it plays in seeking to inform and improve the multilateral approaches and institutions that promote international development. In line with this basic objective of ODC, I will therefore take the next few minutes to share with you some ideas about the African Development Bank -- by taking up aspects of its past, present and future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AfDB Group</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you may know, the African Development Bank Group comprises mainly the Bank itself, established in 1964, which is the non-concessional window with a capital base of about US$24 billion 20($24,000 million); and the African Development Fund, the principal concessional resource affiliate, with total subscriptions of over $11 billion ($11,000 million) (before the latest Seventh Replenishment).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Agreement establishing the Bank stipulates that it shall contribute to the economic development and social progress of its regional member countries, individually and jointly. At the beginning, the membership was composed only of African countries, but today total membership stands at 77 regional and non-regional countries, with the United States as the leading non-regional shareholder, having 5.7 percent of the total voting power. Additionally, the United States accounts for some 13 percent of subscriptions to the African Development Fund (before the latest Seventh Replenishment).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These contributions have enabled the United States to work in concert with other donors in the provision of finance and technical assistance supporting development programmes in Africa. This is reinforced by the representation of the United States in the governing bodies of the Institution, which gives it a strong voice in the policies and management of the Bank Group. U.S.  participation has also enabled firms in this country to compete in the provision of goods and services for projects and programmes financed by the Bank Group. Thus, at the end of 1995, cumulative Bank Group disbursements for procurement of goods and services to non-regional country suppliers amounted to US$10.8 billion ($10,800 million); of this total, about US$765 million was made to U.S. suppliers. Clearly, therefore, the participation of the United States in the Bank Group has not only been supportive of Africa but also beneficial to U.S. business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank Group has, over the years, pursued the traditional functions of MDBs by mobilizing and deploying resources to finance projects and programmes.  In these areas, the Bank has made major strides from its modest beginnings in the 1960s so that by the end of 1995, the Bank Group had cumulatively approved over 1900 loans and grants amounting to nearly $30 billion ($30,000 million). While financing projects has constituted the primary preoccupation, the institution has, in response to the crisis of the 1980s, also been substantially engaged in policy-based operations to support reform and adjustment programmes, in close cooperation with the World Bank. For the period 1987 to date, policy-based operations have accounted for some 20 percent of Bank Group commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent Institutional Reforms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank Group, like other MDBs, has been seeking ways to enhance the quality of its operations and to foster overall development effectiveness.  For the past one year or so, specific reforms have been implemented in respect of operational quality, financial management, institutional management and organization, and overall governance and related matters. With regard to operations, the main thrust has been the implementation of an Action Plan for improving the quality of operations centering on issues of portfolio performance and lending policies and practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Country assistance strategies are now systematically guiding all lending operations which (have) fully taken into account country risk and country performance. Along with these, there has been active work to complete an overall review of the Bank Group's Portfolio. The first Annual Portfolio Performance Review Report has been considered by our Boards of Directors this month -- revealing reasonable overall performance so far, although more remains to be done. Attention has also been given to strengthening post- evaluation activities as a means of organizing and using lessons of experience in designing new projects. Consultations with other MDBs are also going on for exchanging experiences and advancing on technical methodologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to procurement of goods and services for projects funded by the Bank Group, a revamped system has been put in place to ensure complete transparency and unambiguous implementation procedures. Efforts have also been sustained to cancel non-performing loans and grants. In this regard, a major cancellation of loans and grants -- adding up to over US$2 billion ($2, 000 million) for the Bank Group over September 1995 to July 1996 -- has been concluded after extensive consultations with the borrowers. The resources so freed will be returned to the appropriate common pools for reallocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the area of financial management, emphasis has been placed on controlling loan arrears by tightening the policy on sanctions, by systematically applying directives on cancellations, and by increasing coordination with the Bretton Woods Institutions. Beyond these, recent internal studies and Board Discussions have addressed the Bank's lending rate, currency management, and net income management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the organizational side, the Bank's leaner structure put in place early this year, is now well in place. The new structure entailed the compression of supervisory posts by well over a third of the previous size; and separation, with compensation of about 20 percent of staff members. More recent efforts have been focused on efficient and transparent recruitment as well as on determination of training requirements. A number of training programmes, for example, in macro-economic analysis and environmental management, have already commenced. We are also proceeding with plans to relaunch the Young Professionals Programme to ensure renewal of staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On overall institutional governance, a Special Study on Governance and Related Issues is being considered by the Bank's Ad-Hoc Committee of Governors on the Fifth General Capital Increase. Aspects of the Study that do not require actions by Governors are already being addressed by Management and the Boards of Directors. There are other ongoing exercises relating to the review of policies and operations as well as to financial control and management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme of reforms has come a long way and received the endorsement of our shareholders, regional and non-regional -- as partly reflected in the conclusion this year, of consultations on the Seventh General Replenishment of the African Development Fund. As a result, total concessional resources amounting to about US$3.0 billion ($3,000 million) will be available to fund projects and programmes over the period 1996-98 in the low-income regional member countries. On this basis, we should be able to support a combined -- concessional and non-concessional -- annual lending programme of about US$2.5 billion ($2,500 million) over the same period. To supplement our own resources, we will step up our catalytic role by intensifying Bank Group collaboration and co-financing activities with bilateral and other multilateral development institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development and Operational Policies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Permit me to address next some issues in development policy and operations.  The current development policy priorities of the Bank Group emanate from Africa's over-arching development objectives in the 1990s. These focus on accelerating production growth, promoting human resource development, poverty reduction, and attending to the foundations of longer-term development. In furtherance of these objectives, the Bank Group would also provide support for critical cross-sectoral concerns, such as women in development, environmental management, and private sector promotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank Group accords high recognition to the central role that should be accorded to poverty reduction in the continent. Estimates by international institutions, for instance, indicate that, on current trends, while the number of poor people elsewhere in the developing world would decrease by 300 million over the fifteen years to the turn of the century, the number in low- income Africa is projected to increase by 85 million. And this situation is being exacerbated by the AIDS pandemic threatening a rising share of the population. Consequently, therefore, the Bank is evolving deliberate approaches to supporting the attack on poverty. A substantial share of Bank Group interventions (as much as 65 percent in the case of concessional resources) would be directed to projects and programmes in agriculture and the social sectors; and some programmes would be direct and targeted at poverty reduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our overall approach to poverty reduction and related issues -- like the environment -- we have been seeking cooperation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs). For as you know, NGOs have often made the greatest impact in areas like grassroot activities, gender issues, and community participation, which have eluded official development assistance. We have a policy in place to increase collaboration with NGOs. Already, the Bank has held several consultations with regional and non-regional NGOs, and a major conference is scheduled for November 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preparatory discussions have focused on issues of enhancing collaboration between the Bank and NGOs on policy concerns and other activities, especially the Bank's poverty reduction programme. We will be making further strides in this area, with the finalization of a new micro- enterprise assistance strategy which will set the framework for extending micro-credit to the poorest groups, using NGOs and other grassroot organizations. In working with NGOs and with others in the development community, we intend to systematically provide information on all relevant activities of the Bank Group -- to encourage transparency and dialogue. The Bank Group's Policy on Disclosure of Information -- including a proposal to establish an Information Centre -- is under consideration of our Boards of Directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I should also mention, in the context of poverty reduction and social development, a major issue -- the debt of the poor countries -- currently on the active agenda of the international community. We in the Bank have supported and participated in the international consultations on the issue.  Internal reflections are, therefore, under way in consultations with the Bretton Woods Institutions, on the possible options and modalities that may be applied by the Bank Group for participating in the debt initiative -- of course, subject to our own financial constraints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sustainable, the goal of poverty reduction should be linked with the pursuit of broad-based economic growth, partly through raising the investment rate. In many of the low-income countries, the investment rate is inadequate to meet replacement needs, let alone supporting new production capacity. The goal should be to lift the investment rate not only through increased mobilization of official flows, but also by tapping potentials from domestic sources, especially that coming from the private sector. Indeed, it would not at all be an exaggeration to say that achieving sustained growth would critically depend on the extent to which the private sector succeeds in mobilizing the requisite resources for investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given this importance of private investment, we have in the Bank recently revamped our private-sector strategy to emphasize the aspect of leveraging our financing by acting as catalyst and mobilizer of private capital, both domestic and international. In all these efforts, we will work closely with other financing institutions such as IFC, the World Bank, and bilateral agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five main areas of action, that are more or less being pursued also in other MDBs, will underpin our interventions. First, the Bank will assist more actively in the creation of an enabling environment beyond macroeconomic management -- participating in building up supporting institutions such as land registries, security exchanges and legal regimes that are vital for private enterprise development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, we will consolidate areas of past support by using loans and equity instruments in a more selective manner. And the Bank will seek investment opportunities in countries where enabling environments exist, as well as promote interaction between foreign and local investors so as to create enduring and profitable business relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, the Bank will seek to play a significant role in the private financing of infrastructure, including Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) schemes; and will also provide technical advice to governments on the development of the necessary legal and regulatory framework to attract private financiers for such projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth, the Bank will also play an enhanced role in assisting with privatization. In this field, too, there is need for technical assistance which we could provide. The Bank may also invest directly in the privatized companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the Bank will provide a more focused and enhanced assistance to small and medium-scale enterprises, through lines of credit to performing commercial banks and other financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chairman, private capital has a major role to play in the growth process, and we all welcome the recent encouraging trends in flows to the developing world. But as we also know, these flows have been concentrated in a few countries and have mostly shied away from the low-income ones, partly because of the weak creditworthiness and infrastructural base of such countries. For some time to come, the low-income countries would continue to rely substantially on concessional resources to finance their development programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the context of the African Development Bank Group, consideration of country creditworthiness has entailed that no less than 39 regional member countries, out of a total of 53, remain without access to our non- concessional window for sovereign loans. This means that apart from IDA and other concessional sources, support for these countries will have to come from the African Development Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we speak now, however, the contribution of the United States to the ADF- VII, although pledged, has not been approved by Congress for the coming fiscal year. We are, of course, grateful for the leadership role that has been taken by the U.S. as well as for the pledge, and are sensitive to the constraints facing the U.S. and other donors. But, given the conditions in low-income Africa, it would not be fully practical to engage in accelerating economic development, if concessional resources would not be available in magnitudes that would significantly support the attack on poverty and finance social overhead investments -- that would otherwise remain unattended. And, as we know, improvements in the economic conditions of these countries generate increased demand for the goods and services produced in U.S. and other industrial countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conclusion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's development prospects today stand at crossroads. The process of economic reforms is gaining momentum by the year as the majority of governments are embracing widening dimensions of these reforms and as domestic consensus is growing. Africa's development partners, on their part, have invested both financially and in terms of widening international consensus in what should be done to sustain recovery and development. Yet, we still face major obstacles like the inadequate external capital flows, especially to the poorer countries. These problems, however, are certainly within the abilities of the international community to resolve -- if we could all continue pulling together in the desired direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African Development Bank, as the continent's own institution, has grown to enjoy a unique confidence and trust with government and non-government bodies throughout Africa; and has generated support from development partners beyond the continent. The Bank will, of course, work closely with the World Bank and other multilateral institutions operating in Africa. It will use its locational advantage in the continent, its mostly African staff, and its Africa-specific technical and cultural knowledge to promote socioeconomic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also use its political proximity and closeness to advance policy dialogue with member governments on matters which may be sensitive but yet important for development management. And, it will as well address and assist in important developmental approaches -- like regional cooperation and integration -- that are often so important for faster growth. As a financing institution, the Bank contributes to the additionality of development resources by providing diversity and therefore the spreading of financial risk. The additional financing channel, in turn, could be used and has been used beneficially for co-financing with bilateral and multilateral institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ongoing institutional reforms I outlined earlier are placing the Bank Group on a much stronger footing to meet its mandate of supporting the development and integration of African economies. Importantly, the reforms should go a long way in efforts to ensure the development effectiveness of our operations. Recognizing the positive role of the Overseas Development Council and its friends in promoting international development, I do hope that we can count on your influence and support for Africa and the African Development Bank.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is the text of remarks on September 26 by David F.  Gordon, director of U.S. policy programs at the Overseas Development Council, before the House Subcommittee on Africa, during hearings on the Clinton administrations Africa policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to thank the Subcommittee Chair, Representative Ros-Lehtinen, and members of the Committee for inviting me to testify on the topic of the Clinton Administration's performance in Africa. This is an important topic and I commend the Chair for calling this hearing today. I am particularly pleased to be sharing the table with Ambassador Hempstone, with whom I had the great privilege to serve when he was U.S. Ambassador to Kenya. I also want to commend the Chair, the Ranking Member, Mr. Ackerman, and other members of the Committee for the diligent work of their very talented and hard-working staffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The views that I express this afternoon are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues at the Overseas Development Council or its Board of Directors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF U.S. AFRICA POLICY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent issue of the journal Foreign Policy, as an exception to his generally favorable assessment of the Clinton Administration's conduct of foreign affairs, Richard Ullman, a relatively liberal analyst, gave the Administration a failing grade for its Africa policy, with the tart comment: &quot; No Cold War = No Policy.&quot; This afternoon, my colleagues around this table, none of whom will take umbrage at the label conservative, are presenting their own critical comments concerning the Clinton Administration's Africa policy. So, the Administration's Africa policy has come under criticism from both sides of the spectrum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe that, while not without weaknesses, the Administration's performance in Africa has been basically sound. Before moving on to the details of my assessment, let me comment briefly on the context within which U.S. Africa policy operates. Several elements of the political context have been major determinants of that policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First is the peculiar limbo status of Africa in post-Cold War foreign policy. Stuck between ill-defined, but real, American interests and Africa's peripherality to U.S. strategic or vital concerns, Africa policy is inherently very tricky. Absent the Cold War framework where all regions were part of the chess board of the great game of superpower competition, determination of U.S. interests for several regions has been under dispute, but nowhere has this been more difficult than in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this context, continuing U.S. engagement in Africa has often been justified by an ever-expanding litany of &quot;new&quot; issues and threats that demand immediate American attention. Approaches to Africa by advocates of many political stripes tend to veer among absolutes -- either complete handwashing, domination by a single theme (be it the environment, democracy, or trade promotion), or massive overextension. The Administration has been generally successful in balancing disparate views and moderating extreme pressures from all camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the Administration has been inundated with immediate crises and disasters in Africa. Assistant Secretary Moose has expressed, on several occasions, frustration at his inability to focus on the larger goals of U.S.  policy because of the day-to-day crush of responding to Africa's multiple crises. The proliferation of crises has complicated efforts to articulate and implement broader conceptual themes for policy. Hopefully, Secretary Christopher's impending trip to Africa will help address this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, anti-internationalism in general and anti-Africa sentiment in particular has reared its head in the Congress. In the aftermath of the loss of U.S. lives on the streets of Mogadishu in October 1993, and especially after the 1994 election, U.S. Africa policy has been under something of a &quot; state of siege.&quot; Somalia was a watershed in encouraging congressional and public hostility toward the U.N. and toward active U.S. engagement in Africa.  A barrage of anti-internationalist pressures from the public and Congress, specific calls from Senators Helms and McConnell to substantially cut U.S.  assistance to Africa, and large cuts in the international affairs budget have left Africa policymakers on the defensive, scrambling to justify continued American involvement and to find the resources needed to support that engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this very challenging political context, on the whole the Clinton Administration record on Africa is positive. Moreover, in Africa policy, as in other areas of foreign policy, the Administration is settling onto a more steady tack after some initial rough waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- The Administration worked effectively for change in South Africa, supporting the long negotiating process, providing an ample aid package for the transition period, and working to build a broad relationship with the new South Africa based on the principle of mutual benefit and respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- It played a crucial role in reinvigorating the peace process in Angola, where we now stand on the verge of a decisive breakthrough that holds the promise of ending Africa's longest war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- It has increased pressure on the terrorist-supporting Islamic fundamentalist regime in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- It has provided strong international leadership on humanitarian relief, especially in the Horn of Africa, and has been in the driver's seat on multilateral efforts to promote Africa's own capacities for conflict resolution and peacekeeping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- It has utilized new policy instruments to foster improved human rights, the consolidation of democracy, and more effective governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Finally, the Administration has made Africa a priority within the U.S.  foreign aid program, protecting the African account from the draconian cuts taken from programs to Asia and Latin America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Administration has been somewhat less successful in some other areas:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- It has had difficulty in generating consensus and action in response to the derailing of the democratic transition in Nigeria, Africa's most populous state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Chastened by Somalia and allowing its skepticism towards the U.N. and Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali to overcome fundamental humanitarian considerations, the U.S. (as well as other countries) failed to take preventive action that might have mitigated the tragedy in Rwanda in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- While successfully defending bilateral aid, the Administration has been less successful in defending the U.S. contribution to the International Development Association, the soft-loan window of the World Bank, nearly one- half of whose resources are lent to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFRICA POLICY: THEMES AND IMPLEMENTATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support for democratization, facilitation of conflict resolution, and promotion of economic reform and sustainable development comprise the tripod of the Clinton Administration's Africa policy. These themes reflect the essential continuity of U.S. Africa policy in the post-Cold War era. The Clinton Administration has built upon efforts begun in the Bush Administration to shift U.S. Africa policy away from the negative elements of the Cold War legacy toward more positive ends. It is unfortunate that the bipartisan continuity in U.S. policy towards Africa has not been better recognized since it is a positive sign of consensus in U.S. foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. has stopped supporting dictators and military regimes in Africa.  Instead, there has been a substantial shift in American aid and attention toward countries undertaking transitions to more open political systems and freer economies. In the 1980s, much U.S. aid was wasted in Mobutu's Zaire, Sergeant Doe's Liberia, and Siad Barre's Somalia. But today, U.S. aid resources are directed to those African countries most dedicated to reform and with the best prospects for trade and investment. Among our leading recipients are South Africa, Uganda, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Mali, all of which are going through difficult &quot;dual transitions&quot; to democracy and a market economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. aid is playing an important role in facilitating the return to economic growth and stability that is occurring in most African countries.  Our assistance promotes development by facilitating better economic policies, helping to entrench democratic governance, and supporting basic human resource investments in child survival and girls' education. Partially as a result of these efforts, most African countries have growth rates of over three percent per year and U.S. exports to Africa have been growing at a rate of more than twenty percent annually for the last two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking into account the inherent difficulties involved in promoting democracy in Africa, the Clinton Administration's record is strong. As one of Africa's most astute observers, Professor Ali Mazrui, noted in testimony before this Subcommittee, &quot;the U.S. must recognize the paradox of a strong African desire for democracy combined with a fragile African capability for it.&quot; An oft-heard critique, from democracy advocates and some human rights groups, is that the Administration has failed to live up to the promises concerning democratization made in the 1992 presidential campaign. But the fact that the Administration has not made democracy promotion the be-all and end-all of its Africa policy is a sign of flexibility and maturity rather than failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Administration has signaled U.S. support for democratization by increasing aid programs in new democracies and closing down programs in countries like Cameroon and Togo, where autocrats hijacked democratic transitions. U.S. support, through training and monitoring, has been crucial in the success of &quot;transitional elections&quot; in nearly twenty African countries.  The U.S. has played an important role in all of southern Africa's democratic transitions and, as a result, has an influence in the region far in excess of the still limited formal U.S. presence and economic ties. This influence is already paying dividends for the United States. In the debate on the extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, South Africa lent its considerable moral stature to the U.S. effort to achieve an extension of the Treaty, and was a significant factor in our success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Administration has also worked to advance conflict-resolution and conflict-prevention activities in Africa. Working with members of this Committee from both parties, the Administration supported, and helped shape, the Africa Conflict Resolution Act of 1994. It has supported the efforts of the Organization of African Unity to build an indigenous capacity for conflict resolution, and is now undertaking an intense effort, along with a number of European states, to develop a strategy for enhancing the military capacity of African peacekeeping forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again working with a bipartisan group of members of Congress, the Administration is currently developing a more coordinated approach to facilitating U.S. trade and investment in Africa. The U.S. has played a significant role in promoting economic reform in Africa, and has an interest in maximizing the impact of those reforms on U.S. trade and investment. The Administration has been in intense consultations with the Africa Trade and Investment Caucus, led by Representatives Phil Crane and Jim McDermott, on a set of legislative and executive branch initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUIDEPOSTS FOR THE FUTURE: U.S. INTERESTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Chair, you asked the panelists today for suggestions on how the U.S.  should approach various issues affecting the African continent. In looking at future U.S. engagement in Africa, it is useful to begin by laying out U.S.  interests. Here we must distinguish among actual threats to national security, significant national interests, and mere aspirations. Any hard-headed analysis of Africa must conclude that, with the exception of Sudan's ties to international terrorist organizations, U.S. security concerns in Africa are marginal by any measure. But America does have real interests in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First and foremost is a humanitarian interest. Fifty years ago, in announcing post-World War II reconstruction plans, Secretary of State George Marshall committed U.S. foreign policy to a fight &quot;against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos.&quot; The geographical focus of that fight shifted over the years, from Europe in the late 1940s, to Latin America, and then to Asia.  Today, the focal point for America's spirit of generosity must be Africa.  Although famine and the dire crises Americans readily associate with Africa are in fact rare, Africa remains the world's poorest, least educated, and least healthy region. Indeed, recent polls suggest that public support is strongest for American aid and intervention abroad for humanitarian reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also have economic interests in Africa. Despite the low level of existing commerce, Africa remains a huge potential untapped market for U.S.  trade and investment. Economic opportunities in Africa have improved dramatically in the past several years. The ideological climate in Africa has shifted to a remarkable degree with almost every country at least moving in the right direction of economic reform. Africa boasts more than a dozen active stock markets (with at least five more in the works) and many countries have liberalized their investment codes and begun to attract substantial investment, most notably Ghana, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, U.S. exports to Africa increased by over twenty percent, and recently released Commerce Department figures show that this expansion has continued in the first half of this year. South Africa, because of its sheer economic size and regional domination, is already an important economic partner. On the investment side, numerous Africa-related funds, touting the continent as the &quot;final frontier,&quot; have sprung up in some of the world's biggest investment houses, including Morgan Stanley, Baring Brothers, and Alliance Capital. We need to keep in mind that it was not so long ago that countries in Latin America and Asia that are now lucrative markets for U.S.  trade and investment were considered hopeless, much of the way that Africa is perceived today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several transnational issues directly affect the United States and can only be adequately addressed through bilateral and multilateral cooperation with African partners. The lesson from the battle against smallpox and AIDS is that global efforts are necessary to wipe out some public health threats.  International drug trafficking and crime syndicates are a rising problem that can only effectively be dealt with through cooperative efforts. The U.S. also has a substantial interest in preventing the further expansion of drug and crime networks in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the African-American community wants the U.S. to be engaged in Africa. The end of the Cold War has made regional and issue-specific constituencies increasingly influential in U.S. foreign policy. Such ethnic influence in foreign policy has a long history in American politics and is certainly well within the American tradition. A successful foreign policy must reflect and incorporate the views, values, and concerns of all segments of American society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROMOTING U.S. INTERESTS: SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM APPROACHES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Cold War, the central policy debate concerning Africa was between those who favored a short-term approach based on Cold War calculations and those who proposed a long-term strategy based on fostering more rapid economic growth and development. In 1987, Congress put its weight decisively behind the latter approach by creating the Development Fund for Africa (DFA). But, as long as the Cold War continued, a long-term approach based on the development paradigm could never prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past few years a new, and largely unaddressed, tension has emerged between long-term and short-term involvement. On the one hand, the underlying logic of the DFA legislation remains valid. Encouraging and supporting &quot; development&quot; -- social, political, and especially economic -- is the basic long-term strategy for attaining many, indeed most, of the United States' goals in Africa. On the other hand, events on the ground in Africa and political pressures at home have pushed U.S. Africa policy into a much more short-term mode. To some extent, this is unavoidable and appropriate. Yet, the increasing pressures for immediate response, combined with the insistence by NGOs and many in the Congress that U.S. development assistance efforts focus on child-survival and other immediate social expenditures, threaten to take the U.S. &quot;out of the game&quot; of long-term development. We need to restore a balance between short-term and long-term approaches in order to effectively promote U.S. interests in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: The Short Term: Criteria for Crisis Intervention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many African countries, it clearly makes little sense to think long- term as they face political, economic, or social crises. The U.S. clearly has a role in these situations in providing humanitarian and emergency assistance, but the question is how can the U.S. decide where and when to act, beyond emergency relief, in crisis or potential-crisis situations? The cold realities are that in most instances the U.S. will not be able to successfully engage or intervene. But there are a number of cases where the U.  S. will not be able (to), and should not, disengage. What specific criteria justify intervention?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- The first is large states that hold the key to regional stability. This would only include a few countries, most notably Nigeria and Zaire (as well as Kenya and South Africa, should a major crisis arise). While the disintegration of the Togolese state would be a tragedy for Togo, it would have no regional implications and pressure for external assistance would fall into the lap of the intimately engaged French. But the collapse of Nigeria into chaos or civil war would likely have regional repercussions that could unleash waves of instability and mass migration throughout West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Second are countries where the U.S. has significant economic interests.  Again, this would involve only a very limited number of countries, with Angola and Nigeria being the two obvious cases due to the vast quantities of oil we import from them. The United States annually purchases over $5 billion ($5,000 million) of Nigerian oil and $2 billion ($2,000 million) from Angola.  Major American companies, including Mobil, Chevron, Exxon, and Texaco, have significant production and exploration interests in those two countries, with total U.S. private investment topping $6 billion ($6,000 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Third are countries with close historic ties to the United States, in which there is a broad consensus within the international community and in Africa that the U.S. is the relevant dominant external power. Only Liberia and Ethiopia fall into this category. Decisive American engagement in Ethiopia in 1991 was crucial in facilitating the stable political transition following that country's civil war. Unfortunately, the failure of the U.S. to take decisive action at several key moments has been one reason why the Liberian conflict has been so difficult to end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Finally, given the American humanitarian tradition, the U.S. should not ignore crises where, barring international action, large numbers of people face imminent death. While the defining lines would necessarily be fuzzy, in instances of impending mass starvation (Somalia in 1992) or genocide (Rwanda in 1994 and Burundi today), policymakers should be prepared for such contingencies. Simply reacting to emotional public outbursts is no basis for policy. It must be recognized that massive intervention can be dangerous, costly, and fraught with unforeseen complications. But, despite the risks, there will sometimes be no alternative to intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In countries that fall within one of these four categories, the U.S. must be willing to undertake serious diplomatic efforts and to commit both real resources and/or impose real costs in order to invigorate such diplomacy. In this regard, often the U.S. will need to work with other major powers and shape and support United Nations initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B: The Long Term: Focused Support for Development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Successful development will be the long-term key for preventing crises, addressing humanitarian concerns, and taking advantage of economic opportunities. While most of the important challenges and problems facing Africa -- managing ethnic diversity, controlling the population explosion, creating effective and stable polities, promoting higher rates of economic growth -- do not threaten the U.S. directly, there will be costs to the United States should they fail to be successfully addressed. In that context, the interests that the United States does have in Africa -- avoiding human suffering and the need for large-scale emergency relief, developing markets for American products, addressing global health, drug, and crime problems, preventing breeding grounds for international terrorism -- will be much harder, and probably impossible, to achieve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is that the prospects for development in Africa, and the ability of international assistance to facilitate development, have never been better. A number of long-standing conflicts have been resolved, misguided experiments with socialism have been abandoned, and a new generation of highly competent political and economic managers now occupy senior roles in most countries. Some twenty-five Africa countries are moving forward, if in many cases slowly, on economic reform and democratization and/or national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, within Africa a broad consensus has emerged on a strategy for development that is consistent with U.S. interests. This strategy emphasizes the following themes: first, the importance of effective macro-economic management; second, the need to promote the market and private sector as the engine of economic growth; third, the centrality of sustainable investment in basic education and health; fourth, the continuing need to reduce the rate of population growth; and fifth, the importance of strengthening the institutional underpinnings for development, both within the government and in the non-governmental sectors. At the center of the new consensus is the belief that while external assistance can be helpful, the primary impetus for development can only come from within.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can the United States best support this agenda?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, by continuing to support the International Development Association (IDA), the soft-loan window of the World Bank. IDA resources remain central to both the ongoing process of economic policy reform and to the vast bulk of major investment activities ranging from human resource development through improved basic health and education, the expansion of the financial systems, and the rehabilitation and construction of basic infrastructure needed for economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, by ensuring that as African countries recover economically and begin to increase their exports, they do not run into restrictive trade barriers. Particularly problematic are the rules of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, in which a percentage increase in a country's exports to the U.S.  within each category of textile goods automatically triggers a quota response. African countries are starting from such a low base that even modest success can provoke such a quota, as the U.S. recently slapped on Kenyan textile exports. Although such incidents are rare and relatively minor today, as Africa grows, these barriers may become more onerous in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, by better concentrating bilateral assistance both substantively and geographically. American bilateral programs should be concentrated in those countries showing strong commitments to private-sector-based development, effective human resource investments, improved governance, liberalization of their political sphere, and respect for international human rights norms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Substantively, U.S. assistance programs should focus on key areas in which the U.S. has a comparative advantage, which are high priorities within the African development consensus, and which will serve to create a broader range of economic linkages between the U.S. and Africa. Existing U.S. aid programs are spread too thin and in some ways lag behind the current African consensus.  They often pay too little attention to the opportunities that exist for promoting expanded trade and investment ties between the U.S. and Africa, and are increasingly looking away from programs aimed at improving governmental performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reformed U.S. bilateral aid program in Africa should focus in four areas: first, reducing population growth rates through provision of family planning services and better child and maternal health care; second, improving governance by strengthening the capacity of African governments and enhancing non-governmental voices; third, promoting more dynamic microenterprise development to unleash the latent talents of Africa's hidden entrepreneurs and create expanded employment opportunities; and fourth, developing an African trade and investment partnership that will both provide a stimulus for economic growth in Africa and deepen the trade linkages between U.S.  firms and 600 million potential consumers of American goods in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the crisis-ridden political context within which it has had to operate, the Clinton team's overall record in Africa is positive. By emphasizing the areas that I have highlighted, the next Administration, whether led by President Clinton or Senator Dole, can do even a better job of focusing policy in more deliberate ways and best serve U.S. interests in Africa into the next century.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is testimony by Walter Kansteiner, senior associate at The Forum for International Policy, in a September 26 hearing before the House Subcommittee on Africa, during hearings on the Clinton administrations Africa policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past 10 years, U.S. policy towards Africa has focused on a few core issues -- conflict resolution, political reform, and economic and commercial development being the dominant concerns. The Clinton Administration has not differed from previous administrations. It too has articulated its policies based upon these three central issues. Resolving conflict, encouraging democratic political institutions, and building a strong economy are interlinked, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This testimony is a very brief attempt at examining the Administration's policies and performance on economic and commercial issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a somewhat slow start, the Clinton Administration realized that Africa has commercial potential. With U.S.-Africa trade increasing and direct foreign investment growing substantially, the Administration began searching for ways to promote U.S.-Africa commercial activity. Last year trade with Africa grew 12 percent to $18 billion ($18,000 million). U.S. exports to Africa were about on the same level as our exports to Eastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Direct equity investment has also been expanding. U.S. companies now have as much invested in South Africa alone as they have in Turkey, Israel, or India. (It is interesting to note that the average return on investment in African holdings is 28 percent -- far higher than the 8.5 percent worldwide average.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These impressive economic statistics helped encourage the Clinton Administration to organize a White House Conference on Africa in June 1994.  The message from this conference was on target as senior officials discussed the importance of supporting a strong private-sector throughout Africa. And U.  S. corporations were encouraged to seek out African trading partners, and to look for investment opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference, however, was followed by very little concrete support, but for one important exception, the late Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown. In his three years in office Ron Brown averaged two trips per year to Africa. He led commercial missions, he pushed for greater trade, he encouraged U.S.  companies to invest in Africa. But most importantly he diplomatically but forcefully explained to African leaders that they had to get their economic houses in order if they wanted to succeed in attracting investment dollars.  Ron Brown's voice was heard, and he helped both the African states as well as American companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, since his death, the Commerce Department does not seem to have the same level of interest or energy in pursuing his initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton Administration has also attempted to encourage business contacts with programs such as the U.S.-South Africa Binational Commission, which has a business council component.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These limited efforts at supporting commercial activity between the U.S.  and Africa have been quite helpful. But the next administration, whether Democrat or Republican, should begin to consider how the U.S. can influence, persuade, cajole, and push African states towards more aggressive free market economic policies. The U.S. voice in Africa carries far, and we need to demonstrate our commitment to a strong private sector throughout the continent. African governments have long dominated their own economies and their country's commercial activity. But if Africa is to prosper, governments must give up the reins of economic power and release the private sector from excessive regulations and restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privatizing state-owned companies is an important first step in taking governments out of critical commercial sectors. Often, African political leaders are reluctant to carry out privatization programs. But privatization of state assets is the most efficient way of transforming equity structures and making these companies preform on a commercial basis. The U.S. government must support privatization efforts, bilaterally, as well as through the international financial institutions like the World Bank, IMF, and African Development Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next Administration must also focus on the region's most likely economic success story -- southern Africa. Along with the rest of the world, the current Administration has thoroughly enjoyed the success of Nelson Mandela's new South African government. But the honeymoon is over, South Africa and the southern African region must make some tough economic decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Africa has a population of about 125 million; it is a region that has excellent resources and commercial infrastructure. It could develop internal trading patterns that would benefit all of the countries in the region. What is desperately needed is some type of free-trade agreement or structure. The U.S. government should be actively encouraging the region's political and commercial leaders in discussing and building plans for a Southern Africa Free Trade Zone. Perhaps the nucleus institutions already exist with the South African Customs Union and SADC (Southern African Development Community). But the next administration could assist in building an African economic institution that would have long-term commercial benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next administration needs to continue the hands-on type commercial activity that Ron Brown actively pursued. But it also must become engaged in helping African countries take the right steps toward building private-sector- dominated economies. Our active participation in privatization processes, either bilaterally or via international financial institutions, is critical.  We must also become involved in helping Africans formulate economic strategies that appear overwhelming, like a Southern African Free Trade Zone, yet are absolutely necessary if Africa is to become economically viable in the next century.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official source said here that the victims were mainly pygmies, who live on hunting and gathering of fruits in the forests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No further details were given about the nature of the disease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi - The former speaker of the Burundi parliament, Leonce Ngendakumana, on Wednesday left the German Embassy in Bujumbura, where he had sought protection since the July 25 coup against President Sylivestre Ntibantunganya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am urging all Burundians to remain calm and talk to each other in an effort to solve the country's problems,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngendakumana told PANA Wednesday in Bujumbura that he would make a public announcement Thursday on his reasons for leaving the embassy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only former President Ntibantunganya, who was ousted by Maj. Pierre Buyoya, is still hiding in the United States Embassy. On taking power, Buyoya immediately suspended political parties and the National Assembly. However, facing a strong economic embargo imposed by the neighboring countries, he relented and announced the first parliamentary session would open on Oct. 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burundian parliament, elected in June 1993, was dominated by the majority Hutu party, the Burundi Democratic Front or FRODEBU. It had 65 members in parliament. The Tutsi-dominated Unity for National Progress, or UPRONA, had 16 representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, FRODEBU now has less than 10 parliamentarians. Others were killed together with the first democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, in an abortive coup d'etat on Oct.21, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the July coup, the majority of FRODEBU members of parliament joined the main Hutu rebel group, the National Council for Defence and Democracy, headed by Ndadaye's former interior minister, Leonard Nyangoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 150,000 Burundians are estimated to have died in revenge killings between the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi ethnic groups, following Ndadaye's death.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - World tobacco leaders meet in Zimbabwe in November, to discuss the growing contribution of tobacco to development in poor countries and the threat of the anti-smoking lobby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) public relations director, Lal Taylor, said the week-long meeting of the International Tobacco Growers' Association from November 1 to 7 would also celebrate the importance of Africa in global tobacco production.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe is a founder member of the association and one of the world's top three producers of flue-cured tobacco which brings in more than 700 million U.  S. dollars into the country annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor said for many African countries, revenue from tobacco exports was playing a major role in their social and economic development, and it was evident that Africa's contribution to world tobacco output was increasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the largest growth rates in production of more than two percent was expected in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local tobacco farmers are this year expected to increase the area planted to tobacco to produce a crop of about 230 million kg compared with just over 202 million kg grown in the 1995/96 season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ITGA was founded in 1984 by six of the world's major tobacco producing countries-Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Malawi, the United States and Zimbabwe- and its main mission is to &quot;be the active voice and representative of tobacco growers throughout the world&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - The United Nations Wednesday condemned the killing of several civilians in Sinje, Liberia, on Saturday, calling it a serious violation of human rights and the rights of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. secretary-general's special representative to Liberia, Anthony Nyakyi, said in New York that the U.N. Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) was making urgent arrangements to investigate the incident.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quoting reports from U.N. agency and relief workers, he said the massacre left at least 17 civilians dead, mostly women and children, and many more wounded. It caused about 1,000 people to flee Sinje, in Grand Cape Mount County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Other reports put the figure of the dead at between 25 and 42,&quot; Nyakyi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident, he said, demonstrated the serious consequences in implementing the Abuja peace process whereby the warring factions are to disengage and be disarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I call on all armed factions to disengage their fighters without any further delay,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the massacre was a setback to the efforts to deliver food to the needy in the interior of the country. It has also hurt efforts by the West African peace Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and the mediating team to facilitate the opening up of roads to the interior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The callousness of the attack is demonstrated by the savage hacking of the leg of an eight-month-old girl who was evacuated by relief workers to Monrovia,&quot; Nyakyi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The perpetrators are yet to be established. The massacre is the latest in a series of incidents which have marred numerous attempts to end Liberia's more than six-year-old civil war, in which an estimated 150,000 people have been killed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUROSSOGUI, Senegal - The township of Ourossogui, 673 km north of Dakar, the Senegalese capital, has witnessed an upsurge in the number of people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which leads to the incurable AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ourossogui hospital's chief laboratory technician, Djegane Sarr, who is in charge of AIDS tests, says an average of three people are diagnosed with the virus per month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in a recent interview that 48 HIV-positive individuals had been diagnosed as of Sept. 25. Out of these, 42 had already developed full-blown AIDS. Six blood donors were also found to be HIV-positive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the trend continues, he added, the 1996 figure of infected people could surpass the previous year's, which was at least 59, 10 of whom were blood donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Sarr, AIDS cases are on the rise in Ourossogui because its menfolk are great travellers. After living for long periods in Central Africa, Europe or the United States, some of them get infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarr claimed these returnees were responsible for the propagation of the HIV in Ourossogui. To prove his point, he cited the 1996 statistics which indicated that two thirds of the carriers were men while the remainder were women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the high infection rates, he added, Ourossogui hospital is increasingly finding it difficult to get uncontaminated blood for needy patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paradoxically, even when one tries to obtain blood from accompanying relatives, most of them are also found to be seropositive when their blood is sent for diagnosis at the provincial hospital in Saint-Louis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarr cited the example of a pregnant woman who gave birth under very difficult conditions after waiting in vain for her husband's blood. The blood was found to be contaminated with the HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For ethical reasons, Sarr did not reveal the sad news to the woman but said he intended to conduct a blood test on her and her child to check whether they were infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened to the father? &quot;He disappeared and has not shown up again after vowing that he has never left his village for any place where he might have caught the disease,&quot; the laboratory technician added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such disappearances, to avoid shame, are common among Ourossogui's Fulani community. AIDS victims in this ethnic group only return for hospitalisation at the terminal stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, nearly all the AIDS patients who were diagnosed at Ourossogui hospital went home to die quietly, except for two brothers aged 17 and 19, who report to hospital for the required tests every three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two were found with the virus when they donated blood together with three other brothers, who have not shown up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Sarr, women, who remain behind when their husbands travel, appear to be better informed about the disease's danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited the example of a young woman, who, after observing her husband's failing health, refused to have anything to do with him unless he went to see a doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the husband tested positive, the woman only agreed to return to conjugal home after conciliation efforts. She nonetheless refused to have sex with him until his death, two months later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarr is so affected by blood scarcity that sometimes he has to donate his own to save a patient. He has now embarked on a sensitization programme among the population, which is however not having an impact due to language barrier and lack of teaching materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To remedy the situation, Sarr has suggested to his superiors to make arrangements for blood donations among school children in Matam and Bakel districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children in these districts are believed to be less infected by the HIV virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senegalese anti-AIDS programme officials estimate that only 1 percent of the country's population is HIV-positive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luanda - President Chiluba said here last night that he was very disappointed with UNITA leader Dr Jonas Savimbi's decision to boycott the Southern African Development Community heads of state summit which opens today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba was speaking when United Nations Secretary-General Boutrus Boutrus-Ghali's special envoy to Angola, Dr Allion Blondin Beye called on him at his presidential suite at Meredien hotel here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba said he had been assured as late as Sunday afternoon by the UNITA leader that he would attend the summit which had been called by SADC leaders to try to put the Angola peace process back on track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President, who had personally invited Dr. Savimbi to the summit, said he was very disappointed with the guerrila leader's action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba disclosed that he had earlier sent two envoys -- former Foreign Affairs Minister Vernon Mwaanga and Lusaka business tycoon Enock Kavindele - to extend his invitation to Dr. Savimbi to attend the summit. He said Dr.  Savimbi assured the two envoys that he would attend the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba who has expressed concern about lack of progress in implementing the 1994 Lusaka peace protocol between the MPLA government and UNITA, said he wanted to give chance to Dr. Savimbi to tell SADC leaders and the world at large about the problems he was facing in implementing the peace pact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia hosted peace talks between the Angolan government and rival UNITA in November 1994 to end two decades of civil war that erupted soon after independence from portugal in 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two parties eventually signed the Lusaka agreement on November 20, 1994 and are currently in the process of implementing the time table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the current setback, Mr Chiluba said he and other leaders would continue to persue efforts that would bring lasting peace to the war torn SADC member country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it is only through peace that the people of Angola would improve their quality of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile President Chiluba said here last night that Zambia will go to the polls this year using the controversial 1996 republican constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba also ticked off outsiders who are meddling in the country's affairs that &quot; the matter of the constitution are not for outsiders but for the Zambians themselves&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was addressing Zambian military and police observers seconded to the United Nations peace keeping forces and Zambian nationals at the residence of Zambia's ambassador to Angola Major-General Benua Bulaya in Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba stated that elections will take place this year and will be based on the 1996 republican constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said no group of people can claim to be competent in making laws than parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president who conceded that there has been pressure from certain quarters who have threatened to cut aid&quot; if we do not withdraw the new constitution,&quot; reiterated that the new law was not targeted against a particular individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He maintained that there was no crisis in Zambia. In another development, Mr Chiluba paid tribute to Zambian peace keepers whom he said had brought honour to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Commander of the Zambia Armed Forces, he was proud of their contribution to international peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no nobler assignment than the one you are doing,&quot; he told military and police observers assigned to the UN peacekeeping forces in Angola.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier , Zambia's ambassador to Angola, Major-General Bulaya told the President not to listen to &quot; old and spent&quot; forces who are trying to detract him from the course he was taking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the President to stick to the path he had taken so that Zambians can continue to enjoy the fruits of independence. He said all the servicemen serving in Angola were solidily behind his leadership.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambia Privatisation Agency (ZPA) has announced the privatisation of two major companies in the energy sector, BP Zambia Limited and AGIP Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the announcement at the ZPA monthly press briefing yesterday, the agency's chief executive, Valentine Chitalu, said the government has sold its 25 per cent of shareholding in BP to BP Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has sold its 50 per cent shareholding in Agip Zambia Limited to Agip Petroli International BV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BP shareholding was sold at US$3.3 million while the AGIP shareholding went at $850,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giving an overview of the pace of privation, Chitalu said out of 118 companies dealt with so far, 88 have been sold to Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the trading sector's 178 shops or properties, 92 per cent have been sold to Zambians, Chitalu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Out of 30 companies sold to foreigners, 14 companies were outside ZPA control due to the B' shareholders having pre-emptive rights,&quot; Chitalu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitalu also announced the sale of Lyambai Hotel in Mongu to J.S Songolo and two others at K55 million. Zambia Pork Products has been sold to Webster Musukwa at K500 million. This includes accrued employee benefits amounting to K200 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerning some tourist lodges which are due for re-advertisement by the state, Chitalu said the process of finding new bidders for the tourist lodges would be undertaken by the tourism ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lodges no longer fall under the ZPA,&quot; Chitalu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the agency hopes to cash in $20 million from company sales this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it will obviously be more, seeing that last year we made $33 million,&quot; Chitalu said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The disclosure by the Munyama Human Rights Commission that the inhuman treatment of citizens that characterised UNIP's Second Republic has continued into MMD's Third Republic is sad but expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights violations are not committed in a vacuum. Just as there are political set-ups that help promote democratic rule and respect for the humanity of all citizens, some political systems and practices can only survive through repressive constitutional and legal arrangements and deeds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And repression knows no religion or ideology. Repression under Cuba's communist rule is not different from that of Iraqi's Islamic regime. It is also not different from that of UNIP's humanist society or that of MMD's capitalist and Christian nation. Repression is repression. Period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the question of whether UNIP's repressive regime existed for 17 years while that of the MMD has been for a much shorter period is neither here nor there. Repression cannot be measured by longevity or intensity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with MMD's leadership's exhibited desire to stay in office at all costs we are headed for more human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constitutional and legal framework the MMD government has put in place will inevitably lead to a clash with citizens who hold liberties dear. And the government is very much aware of the fact that it will not be possible for President Frederick Chiluba and the MMD to govern without resorting to the use of force to crush dissent and opposition in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this is why the government has amended the country's constitution to give President Chiluba powers to be the prime mover and controller of every activity in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This also explains the introduction of the Intelligence Bill whose effect will be to turn the country into a police state, with the President as chief constable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The introduction of a permanent Human Rights Commission, given the myriad of laws whose enforcement automatically result in violation of human rights, is a ploy to deceive the international community and retain some respectability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future, unless the current trend is quickly reversed, does not hold much for human rights protection and promotion as it does for the entrenchment of their violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Commonwealth Human rights Initiative that visited the country last month observed, the political situation in Zambia merits attention from its friends and the international community at large as the country's fragile experiment in democracy building is under threat in a situation where the shortage of time is a critical factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The direction in which the country is headed is clear. The time to start the fight and defend our dignity is now, tomorrow may be too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposing view: Government Is Committed To Human Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Amusaa Mwanamwambwa, chief government spokesman and information minister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has decided to establish a permanent Human Rights Commission with a view to preventing further violations of human rights in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government has decided to, among other measures, establish a permanent Human Rights Commission which is enshrined in the amended Republican Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action is being followed up by the enactment of an enabling Human Rights Commission Act during the current sitting of the National Assembly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The government yesterday released the report of the Munyama Human Rights Commission of Inquiry which was unofficially published by The Post in January this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the accompanying government's reactions to the commission's recommendations contained in a white paper has thrown out most of the &quot;touchy&quot; recommendations, especially those on the judiciary, prison service and the immigration department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has, for instance, rejected the recommendations which would have provided for speedy trials and that in those cases where trial does not commence within thirty days, the accused if in custody must be set free unconditionally and another which would have empowered the Chief Justice to require fellow judges to provide an up-date on the status of cases under their charge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not accepted because the provisions of Article 13 (3) of the Constitution are adequate. Moreover, the judiciary is currently working on amendments of the rules of regulating adjournment,&quot; read the government's reaction in part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The white paper has also rejected the recommendations which would have amended Section 7 of the Zambia Security Intelligence Services Act to withdraw ordinary police powers from security officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not accepted. Section 7 of the Act gives police powers to intelligence officers only in a State of Emergency,&quot; government's reaction reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the recommendation which called for the establishment of separate wards for prisoners and remandees in hospitals to avoid the illegal practice of shackling them to beds in the ordinary wards, the government reacted thus: &quot; This is not accepted. The solution lies in the improvement of medical facilities within prison premises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government also rejected the recommendation which sought to have prisoners incarcerated in prisons situated near their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overnment has also thrown out a recommendation for the defence force not to be involved in activities which are clearly for the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not accepted. The defence forces may be involved in such activities at the invitation of the police force,&quot; reacted the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, in a tail spin of things, the report does not have names of people detained between 1989 and 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when challenged, information minister, chief government spokesman, Amusaa Mwanamwambwa, who released the report, claimed &quot;there were no detentions during that period&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwanamwambwa conceded that the findings have taken long to be released but claimed &quot;assignments involving any Commission of inquiry need to be handled systematically and carefully&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when asked what was happening to the Gabon Report, which has been long standing than the Munyama Report, Mwanamwambwa retorted: &quot;That falls under the baby of the ministry of defence. It could be it's not ready yet...and I know its not ready, I could have seen it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mwanamwa-mbwa also disclosed at the same press briefing that the government has decided to establish a permanent Human Rights Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With a view to preventing further violations of human rights in Zambia, the government has decided to, among other measures, establish a permanent Human Rights Commission which is enshrined in the amended Republican Constitution,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwanamwambwa said. &quot;This action is being followed up by the enactment of an enabling Human Rights Commission Act during the current sitting of the National Assembly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A fear-gripped Mozambican national soccer team arrived in the country yesterday with their Portuguese-based wing terror, Jojo Fernandes admitting: &quot;Zambia is surely the favourite&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jojo, who plays his club football for Portuguese second division side, Penafiel, observed that playing Africa's highly-rated team, the Mozambicans are under pressure to secure a win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambia seems to have the advantage of being the best team in Africa and I think we may have a little problems but this is football, we can still do something,&quot; said Jojo in an interview shortly after the arrival.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But skipper of the side, Francisco Canonde could only say; &quot;We shall wait for the day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And trainer of the side, Arnalo Salvao, whose 18-player-squad has brought only four professinals, said although he rates Zambia highly, he could not predict the outcome of the match as both teams were prepared .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from Jojo , Chiwinho Conje is another player playing in Portugal, while two other professionals-Nuw Tuauwsine and Cachola Jwene play in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are aware that Zambia is a very good team in Africa, but I think since we have all trained, it would be match that will be interesting. But I can not say if we will play attacking or defending football,&quot; said Salvao.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was the Mozambican high commissioner in Zambia, Cristopa Jamo, who appeared rather overzealous, urging the players to win at all costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Jamo, rather diplomatic after seeing that Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) general secretary, Julio Chiluba, was present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We always play to win, we don't play to draw and lose but if we draw it is always by accident. Even this game , we can win, I hope it will happen,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And embattled FAZ boss, Michael Chiti, yesterday announced a slash of the gate fees for the Zambia-Mozambique match following pressure from fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those wishing to watch the match at the VIP stand will still have to pay through the nose as nothing has been done to the K50,000. charge, but it will be K1, 000. for children, K5,000. and K3,000. Open wings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The date was January 25, 1996 and the giant Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein, South Africa, was alive with excitement and hurrah which Ghanian and Mozambican fans had brought to the African Nations Cup finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fans for both sides had good reason to be excited: Ghana, a messy first round their team were determined to stay in the race for the cup they have won a record four times while Mozambique were gunning for their first ever quarter final berth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After kick-off, Mozambique looked like they would upset Ghana and, for 45 minutes, it appeared their self-assurance was fully justified. Comfortable on the ball, ticking smoothly and covering with speed and commitment which sealed the central approach to their danger zone. They even managed to nod in one goal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then something snapped. Ghana blasted in two goals and Mozambique's dreams were shattered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the Mamba's (as Mozambique national soccer team is known) are back in Africa's premier soccer cup against the awesome power of Zambia's Chipolopolo eleven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can they do the unthinkable, beat Zambia right in it's own backyard?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer is definitely an emphatic NO, especially when you analyse their track record from their debut in the Nations Cup in 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have lost crucial matches, earning them the nickname &quot;traditional losers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their maiden game, they made a false start beating Lesotho 6-0 but in the return match, Lesotho licked them 2-1 and weeks later, they lost 2-1 to Zaire and they managed a 3-all draw in the return game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1984 qualifying games, they surprised when they whacked an ill- equipped Cameroon 3-0 in Maputo but lost the return match with a resounding 4- 0 rout in Yaonde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambique finally managed a berth at the finals in 1986 after finishing top of the group that comprised Mauritius, Libya and Malawi. Unfortunately they were kicked out in the preliminaries of their group matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They did not qualify for the 1988 finals as they were kicked out in the preliminaries, drawing 1-1 with Zimbabwe and losing the return match 2-3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They met Zambia for the first time during the 1990 qualifying games. They lost 0-1 in Maputo and were bloodied 3-0 at Independence stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years later, they finished second in the qualifying matches after they beat Sudan 1-0, whacked Kenya 2-1 and repeated the routing of Sudan by a lone goal. Their run was, however, stopped by Kenya who beat them 1-0.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 1994 qualifying games, they lost 2-0 to Zaire, beat Lesotho 3-0 and drew 0-0 with Kenya. They again drew 0-0 with Zaire, 1-1 with Lesotho but lost 4-1 against Kenya. They finished third in the group and did not qualify for the finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps their greatest achievement was during the qualifying matches for last year's African Nations Cup finals in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They beat Botswana 3-1, nudged Guinea 2-1 but lost to unfancied Angola 0-1.  But they managed to qualify to the next round by beating Namibia 4-2, Mali 1- 0 and Botswana by three goals to nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They drew with Guinea 0-0, beat Angola 2-1 and drew 0-0 with Namibia. They finished second and qualified to the finals. They, however, bowed out in the quarter finals suffering a 2-1 defeat against Ghana. But do the Mozambicans know what they are up against?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwanamwambwa charged that comments made by the Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) and other quarters expressing concerns on matters relating to the election of the President and dissolution of the National Assembly are misleading the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwanamwambwa was reacting to the concerns raised by the Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) of possible presidential crisis due to the ambiguities introduced by the Constitution (Amendment) Act of 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMT president Alfred Zulu charged that if President Frederick Chiluba continues his stay at State House after October 31, he shall be doing it illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Midnight of November 2, 1996 is the maximum period, beyond that, he will be extending his rule illegally,&quot; Zulu warned on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mwanamwambwa said &quot;such comments have the potential of confusing the members of the public, as they tend to create the erroneous impressions that a vacuum may arise in the governance of the country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the current Constitution, as amended by Act number 18 of 1996, provides under Article 34 (2) that; &quot;An election to the office of the president shall be held whenever the National Assembly is dissolved and otherwise as provided by Article 38&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 38 provides that; &quot;If the office of the president becomes vacant by reason of his death or resignation or by reason of his ceasing to hold office by virtue of Article 36, 37 or 88, an election to office of the president shall be held in accordance with Article 34 within 90 days from the date of the office becoming vacant&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwanamwambwa said the provisions of the law are such that there can be no vacuum at any one time in the office of the President nor the President occupy office illegally in between elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In correcting these unfounded fears and incorrect interpretations of the 1996 Constitution, government wishes to state that the constitutional provisions with regard to these matters are quite clear,&quot; he said. &quot;If the President's tenure ends - regardless of how it ends, whether by death, resignation, impeachment - the constitution provides that there shall be an election within 90 days upon the office becoming vacant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwanamwambwa said when the National Assembly is dissolved, general elections have to be held after 90 days, regardless of how that dissolution occurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President remains in office over a period of 90 days, until he succeeds himself in the event of being re-elected, or another person is elected to the office,&quot; he said, &quot;There is no question therefore of any vacuum occuring in the office of the president and creating a crisis, as it is being claimed, and Article 38 gives powers to the president to act for 90 days and he may do so after he has dissolved the National Assembly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - An outbreak of yellow fever has been reported in the Department of Atakora in the northeast region of the country. The area affected is Kerou Sous Prefecture (population 44,329) where 48 cases and 37 deaths have been recorded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">These cases occurred between July and September 1996. Urgent control measures were put into place following a meeting with the Minister of Health:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">i) an immediate epidemiological investigation to be carried out in the areas affected;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ii) strengthening of surveillance including declaration of all cases of haemorrhagic fever with jaundice;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iii) immediate vaccination of the exposed population and informing the population to use impregnated mosquito nets;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iv) informing countries with common borders of the situation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">v) an entomological investigation into the density of the Aedes population in certain urban areas was also foreseen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A team led by the Minister of Health accompanied by the WR visited the area on 17 and 18 September to assess the situation. A vaccination campaign was started immediately with the stock of 13 000 vaccines already available provided by the French Fonds d'Aide et d'Action Culturelle and WHO. Two further donations of 50,000 doses of vaccine were made by the government of the Netherlands and (by) the European Union. The health authorities plan to vaccinate the whole population of Kerou and surrounding areas (population more than 350,000), and therefore need more than 200,000 further doses for this purpose. An appeal has been made for financial support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travellers are reminded that yellow fever vaccination is obligatory for entry into the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Humanitarian activities in Burundi continue to be limited by the regional sanctions imposed on the country. The September 25 meeting of the Regional Sanctions Coordination Committee (RSCC) in Kigali concentrated on the political stalemate in Burundi. The RSCC did, however, publicly confirm that it had agreed earlier in the week to allow FAO to import limited quantities of fertilizer for non-cash crops and vegetable seeds. A six percent drop in the January 1997 pulse harvest is forecast by FAO as a result of the non-delivery of fertilizer that had earlier been blocked by the embargo. It is already too late to use the fertilizer this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security throughout Burundi remains precarious with ambushes continuing on the main roads and with most of Bujumbura once again without electricity.  Fuel supplies held by the humanitarian community continue to be alarmingly low, and while an order has been made, no new stocks have been received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there have been few reports of new fighting in Burundi over the last week, reports of continued fighting in eastern Zaire have raised concern about the possibility of a new inflow of refugees into Burundi. To date, however, only small numbers of people have crossed into Burundi to escape the fighting in Uvira and Bukavu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. General</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Burundi's neighboring states enforcing sanctions against the Buyoya regime hinted last week that they would allow Buyoya to meet with political leaders of neighboring country's at the next regional summit, effectively reducing the Burundian leader's political isolation. In recommendations issued after the September 25 meeting of the RSCC in Kigali, committee members advised that &quot;Buyoya be invited to be available&quot; for the next regional summit to discuss developments in Burundi. The text added that &quot;other leaders of parties to the conflict (are) also invited to be available.&quot; Buyoya had tried for some time to win an audience with those responsible for imposing the economic sanctions but had been rebuffed until last week. No firm date has yet been set for the regional summit, but it could be as soon as the second week in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Member's of the Buyoya government welcomed the opening even though the wording of the recommendations appeared to give President Buyoya's rule the same degree of legitimacy as that of rebel leaders such as Leonard Nyangoma. &quot; We consider that it is a good thing to be able to explain the situation to our neighbors,&quot; said Minister of Information Pierre-Claver Ndayicariye. &quot;It is never too late to make peace, but while people hesitate about lifting sanctions, the embargo claims innocent victims,&quot; he added in an interview with reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*The power struggle within the Hutu-dominated Frodebu party intensified September 25 with 34 more members backing CNDD leader Leonard Nyangoma's claim to be the new party chief. Nyangoma had announced the previous week that he had wrested the party's presidency away from Jean Minani, the former speaker of the national assembly. Minani continues to contest Nyangoma's claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*In a speech during the September 27 ceremony in which the Burundian Supreme Court swore in Buyoya as head of state, Buyoya reiterated his claim that the coup was necessary to avoid the disintegration of the Burundian state and promised once again to organize a national debate on the country's political future. He added that preparations for the debate were already underway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Howard Wolpe, President Clinton's special envoy to Burundi arrived in Bujumbura September 29 to once again argue for a negotiated settlement of the conflict and a return to constitutional rule. This was his first trip to Burundi since early August, shortly after the July 25 coup. After his September 30 meeting, Wolpe told reporters that he and Buyoya had discussed ways of restoring peace, but gave no other details. Wolpe is expected to leave Burundi October 3 to meet with political leaders of other countries in the region imposing sanctions against Burundi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time since this summer, Burundian authorities have opened their side of the border with Zaire. Although the border was somewhat porous even when it was officially closed, the action by Burundian authorities has made it easier for those supplying the parallel market for fuel in Burundi to bring supplies into the country. The price on the parallel market for fuel is now said to be between 500 FrBu to 700 FrBu, a reduction of several hundred FrBu per liter. Officially, Zaire has kept its side of the border closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burundian army reports that five civilians, ten rebels and two soldiers were killed last week near Rutegama in Muramvya province. Thirteen people were injured in separate attacks in the province over the week but additional details were not available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel ambushes continue along major roads throughout the country, although UN security officials report somewhat fewer ambushes than previous weeks.  Rebels continue to target minibuses transporting passengers and food to markets, as well as other soft, commercial targets. Direct attacks against military units have become infrequent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While attacks along Route 2 between Gitega and Murumvya continue, rebels have now begun to target vehicles travelling along Route 3 between Bujumbura and Rumonge. This week, rebels attacked at least three vehicles traveling on that route with at least one person killed, three injured and three vehicles destroyed. The attacks were in the vicinity of Kabezi, about 25km south of Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to WFP, there are unconfirmed reports of serious clashes in Kayanza province, including an attack on a health center and hospital in Butaganzwa commune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebels have once again destroyed electric pylons in Bubanza province. At least one more pylon was toppled Sunday, once again plunging most parts of the city into darkness and forcing UN agencies and NGOs to divert fuel stocks to run generators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP has had to remove its Twin Otter plane from service in order for it to undergo maintenance in Johannesburg. Without the use of the plane, members of the humanitarian community who need to travel between Bujumbura and other regional towns will be forced to risk travel by road. Use of the plane would be essential should an evacuation of UN staff be necessary. It is expected to be at least a week until the plane is back in service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Affected Populations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reports that refugees continue to cross into Burundi from eastern Zaire. Over 400 have crossed the border since the conflict between Zairian Tutsis and elements of the Zairian miliary erupted last month. Many of those escaping the fighting who have crossed into Burundi are in the troubled Cibitoke province, and will be transported by the Burundian government to a UNHCR camp now being prepared in Gihanga, about 15 km north of the Bujumbura airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACF is exploring the possibility of enlarging its nutritional programs in Gitega, rural Bujumbura and northern Kayanza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Rescue Committee has begun operations in Muyinga province.  In conjunction with the Ministry of Health, IRC will work to improve sanitation in IDP camps and rehabilitate local water systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to WFP, the governor of Ngozi province is discussing with relief agencies, including WFP, the possibility of resettling internally displaced Burundians on the sites of the two former refugee camps in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Humanitarian Coordination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan Sanctions Committee has granted a joint request from the humanitarian community for a bulk shipment of diesel and petrol for UN and NGO humanitarian operations and basic administration. WFP and the UN Resident Coordinator in Tanzania are exploring procedures for importing fuel from that country. On the assumption that the Rwandan shipment will arrive shortly, no order has been placed with Tanzanian suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 30, UNICEF, with the logistical support of WFP, organized an airlift to Burundi of 500 kg of vaccines to prevent the spread of measles and polio. The quantity is sufficient to immunize 150,000 children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF has sent essential drug kits to Rutana and Muyinga provinces through its operational partner IMC, to Cankuzo through MSF-Switzerland and to Bururi through WFP in collaboration with provincial health authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Final touches are being completed on the new draft of the Joint Operations Plan for Humanitarian Assistance in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preparations for a joint-agency assessment mission to examine the state of IDPs in the Gitega region are underway.  5. Impact of Sanctions on the Delivery of Humanitarian Assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent RSCC exemptions granted for medicine have not prevented serious shortfalls in the providing of essential services in the health sector. A major concern continues to be the severe shortage of BCG (tuberculosis) vaccines. UNICEF-donated government stocks of the vaccine are virtually depleted. New supplies have been ordered, but unless they are received within days, the vaccination chain will be broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of fuel continues to limit the ability of all agencies to undertake field activities. It has become increasingly difficult to deliver essential drugs, vaccines and food used in supplementary feeding programs.  Lack of fuel, for example, has prevented UNICEF from supervising the delivery of materials for the repair of water catchment sites and gravity flow systems in Kirundo and Ngozi provinces, as well as the distribution of emergency water and sanitation materials for recently displaced persons in Kayanza and Ngozi provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Materials ordered from suppliers outside the country for the provision of emergency water and sanitation facilities, as well as other humanitarian needs, have been blocked from delivery. Obtaining humanitarian materials locally has become increasingly difficult as supplies have run out and can not be replenished.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA)- Commission to give grades to tourist class hotels</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian Tourism commission announced that it has planned to give grades to tourist-class hotels in various regional states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminary preparations have been finalized in all of the regional tourism bureaux to give a 1.5 stars grades to hotels which can fulfil the criteria set for the grades, according to Ato Matewos Gebre Mariam, department head of standardization and trade licence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there are hotels which fulfil the necessary criteria in Nazareth, Jimma, Goba, Awassa, Harar, and Dire Dawa towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Matewos said grades would also be given to restaurants which prepare foreign dishes in Addis Ababa in the near future and added it has given a two- five star grades to 13 government owned and private hotels until early this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the awarding of the grades is not an ever lasting as the hotels can be upgraded or degraded depending on the timely quality of services they render and features of each of the hotels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department head said if the quality of the services of any hotel is declining, its standard will be lowered, if it increases, the number of stars will be increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission has also issued trade licences to about 40 tour operators which are active in more than one regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New education curriculum goes on trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DESSIE (ENA) - The Amhara Regional Education Bureau said the new curriculum is to be tried for grade three and seven in 14 selected sample schools in Amhara Region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a five day workshop organized to introduce professionals about the new curriculum, Ato Yilma Tirsit, senior curriculum expert in the bureau said the curriculum has been prepared for the different subjects taught in the two grades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new curriculum will be implemented in all schools in the region after amendments are made and text books prepared based on this year's trial, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial on the new curriculum for grades two and six has proved effective and text books were prepared to launch formally the curriculum in all the schools in the region the expert said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous curriculum had shortfalls in solving the problems of the society and has not encouraged the students for research and creativity, Ato Yilma said adding, the new curriculum was designed in such a way that it encourages and invites students for research and creative works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five day workshop reviews the new curriculum for grades two and six and discusses the one for grade three and seven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Premier's press statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press statement he gave to the local newsmen on Saturday, Prime Minister Miles Zenawi said that the recent measures on banning Franco Valuta, price adjustment on petrol and petroleum products as well as the recently imposed rates on shops and other business centres in Region 14 were all taken to break the subsidy-syndrome and promote the principles of market economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether we like it or not the only path to sustainable development in today's world is pursuing the market economy. The hard fact is this: if we succeed in the world market competition we develop; if we lose we wither. And this is attained not by government subsidy but by creating a robust market- oriented economy,&quot; Prime Minister Meles pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Price hike effect: minimal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent increase in the price of petroleum products will not have significant repercussion on the economic status of the consumer because the resulting effect will be cushioned by the better performance of the national economy, Minister of Trade and Industry, Ato Kassahun Ayele said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Ato Ayenew Betwelegne, Vice Minister of Transport and communications, on his part said that since petroleum and derivatives account for less than 18 per cent of the cost of running a car, the effect of the price change on the transport sector is minimal and any change on transportation fares is superfluous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, the Agricultural Input Supply Corporation said the increase in fertilizer price, resulted from the rise in fuel price, is less than 50 cents per quintal. The increment in full price is so insignificant that it would not discourage farmers from buying fertilizers, it is noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic registration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the 51st General Assembly of the United Nations recently, Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said in New York the only durable solution to the political crisis in Africa is the economic regeneration and development of the continent, the only reliable preventive means for ensuring and maintaining peace and stability in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The development of Africa would continue to be a distant dream unless the known obstacles such as debt burden are removed, he said, indicating that Ethiopia is one of the least developed and most indebted countries whose wide ranging and thorough going economic reform programme could easily be adversely affected by the heavy and unbearable debt burden and servicing obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inter-parliamentary meet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement he made recently on arrival at Bole International air Port after attending the meeting held from September 12-17, House Speaker Dawit Yohannes said important decisions believed to alleviate poverty in Africa and minimize the problem of instability in some parts of the continent were made by the sixth inter-parliamentary meeting in Beijing, China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Dawit said the Ethiopian delegation has not chances of voicing various political and economic problems existing in the African continent, to which solutions were suggested by the participants of the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Demera' celebrated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Demera', the finding of the True Cross was colourfully celebrated on Thursday here at the Maskel Square in the presence of hundreds of thousands of the Christian laity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the occasion, His Holiness Abune Paulos, Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, said 'Demera' is both religious and historical and called upon followers of the Christian religion to preserve it for generations to come. The bonfire was lit by the representative of Region 14 Administration after the blessings of the Patriarch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dam construction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 120-million birr Alwero Dam Project, whose construction was delayed for more than a decade for various reasons is now completed, the Water Works Construction Enterprise said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Located about 850 kms away from Addis and 50 kms from Gambella town, the dam has a capacity to hold 75 million cubic metres of water and develop 10, 000 hectares of land, it was learnt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEBREZEIT - The traditional Oromo thanksgiving day known as 'Errecha' was celebrated in the familiarly colourful fashion at Lake Hora, some 50 k.m East of Addis Ababa, on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of the residents of Debre Zeit town and its environs attended the annual event celebrated every second Suday after Maskel-- the Day of the finding of the True Cross. The occasion was marked by throngs of people paying sacrificial tributes to their gods(adbar) of the lake and of the Oda(Oak tree) near Hora under which they sand and danced in chorus- the elders and spiritual leaders taking turns in blessing the ceremony.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Mengesha Gudata, 72, who was accorded the honour of opening the ceremony by blessing the devout said that 'Errecha' was a blend of both the religion and culture of the Oromo people passed and down from generation to generation. &quot;It is an occasion whereby the people give thanks to god for its benevolence in enabiliting them realize their wishes, getting good rains and collecting good harvest, living in peace etc.&quot; the septuagenarian observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pilgrims from as far as Addis Ababa, Nazareth and even beyond carry with them coffee, perfume, incense, alcohol and even precious metals like gold which they leave at the place as token sacrifice in accordance with their previous year's solemn promise to do so for fulfilment of their wishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W/ro Askale Desta, who was making coffee along with a dozen colleagues amidst a dancing and singing crowd under the old sprawling Oda tree, said: &quot; Right at this place last year I vowed to make coffee on the spot in honour of the gods if my prayers about my dislodged children coming back home from abroad in peace were answered; and has so happened&quot; , she told this reporter in high glee and her broad faces suffused by sweat caused by the mid-day heat as well as the extreme suffocation of the crowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers consider it amazing that Christians, Moslems and animists alike from the various nations and nationalities take part in the ceremony by offering sacrifices, dancing and singing to the tune of their respective languages and cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people were also observed taking bath while others swam in the crater lake as a sign of cleansing which they describe as &quot;doing away with the evils of the older Ethiopian year and welcoming the new one in good spirit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debre Zeit, traditionally known as Bishoftu among the Oromos, is a popular weekend resort. The &quot;Errecha&quot; has added to its tourist appeal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The abolition of franco valuta and the availability in the required amount of foreign currency would encourage not only big business ventures but also small retail trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remark came yesterday from representatives of Customs Authority, Addis Ababa Chamber of Commerce, the National Bank and Inland Revenue in an interview with the press in the Ethiopian Television studio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Fisha Dejene, vice chairman of the operation sector of the customs authority said the coming to an end of franco valuta may affect illegal trade but there is no doubt that it would encourage legal businessmen who are entitled to get foreign currency they require from the banks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woizero Yematawork Haile, board member of directors, Addis Ababa Chamber of Commerce, said entrepreneurs operating in the legal frame work do not want to do business with franco valuta in place and called for the existence of banking system free of bureaucratic bottlenecks as well as an effective banks service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Kinfe-Michael WoldeTensay, manager of the foreign exchange department of the National Bank of Ethiopia indicated that the exchange rate in the black market was very high as compared to that to be provided by the banks adding this could facilitate business and make businessmen more active in the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is no franco valuta, there will be no contraband trade in gold and precious stones, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ato Mohammed Abrar Yassin, Inland Revenue Collection Division head, equal amount of interest is demanded for franco valuta which comes to an end today and legal business therefore he said nothing special would happen to businessmen in the absence of the former.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The business system being introduced in Ethiopia would also encourage wholesale trade which enables the importation of commodities at very low prices, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative of the Chamber of Commerce said the chamber could give every possible support to businessmen to encourage them to import additional goods in a bid to prevent the soaring of prices and the scarcity of commodities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Congregations from coast to coast will dedicate themselves to seeking the restoration of freedom and democracy in Nigeria on October 6 by observing Nigerian Freedom Sunday. Nigeria, which marks the 36th anniversary of its independence this month is now suffering under a brutal military dictatorship. Military dictator Sani Abacha has jailed over 7,000 religious, political, labor and human rights activists, including Moshood Abiola, the winner of the 1993 Presidential election.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian Freedom Sunday was established in a Declaration of Conscience on Nigeria endorsed by over 40 prominent religious leaders at a national conference of the Religious Action Network of the American Committee on Africa this May. Declaring that Nigeria, &quot;once a beacon of hope and pride for African people throughout the world ... has been brought low by the brutality and injustice of a military dictatorship.&quot; the signatories pledged to lift their voices in the U.S. on behalf of Nigerian freedom and democracy. They called on all people of good will to join them in this effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. is deeply involved in perpetuating the system of violence and fear.  It buys nearly half of Nigeria's oil exports which provide the ruling military dictatorship with 85% of its annual revenue. Declaring that U.S. and &quot;multi-national corporations exploit Nigeria's vast oil wealth, extracting billions of dollars in profits while Nigerian children go hungry&quot; signatories are marking October 6th as a day of prayer for the victims of oppression and dictatorship and for the peaceful return of freedom and democracy. Hafsat Abiola, daughter of the imprisoned president, will speak at Canaan Baptist Church of Christ in Harlem. &quot;It is important to support this struggle for freedom in Africa's largest country&quot; said Wyatt Tee Walker, Senior Pastor at Canaan Baptist Church and President of the American Committee on Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Religious Action Network is a project of the American Committee on Africa, which was founded in 1953 to support struggles for independence, democracy and economic justice in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is a statement by Nick Burns, U.S. Department of State spokesman, issued October 2, 1996, on the Presidential Election in The Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States deeply regrets that the September 26 presidential election denied The Gambian people the right to choose their leaders in a free and fair manner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-week run-up to the presidential election did not provide a level playing field. The Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC) restricted political participation by banning some former politicians and parties, allowed only a brief campaign period for registered parties, limited television and radio access to certain candidates, and continued to detain political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the two-year transition program the AFPRC detained political prisoners, arrested journalists, and banned political activity. These activities created a climate which was not conducive to holding a free and fair election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We deplore the pre-election violence and resulting arrests. We call on the Government of The Gambia to ensure the safety of all Gambians and other residents in the country, including those who express views different from those of the Government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following are the remarks by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Tunisian Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahia prior to their meeting on October 3, as provided by the State Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER: Good morning. It's always a special pleasure to welcome my friend, Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahia, back to Washington D.C., You know, it's really striking when I think of it: we're almost on the 200th anniversary of U.S.-Tunisian relationships. I guess you could say it has stood the test of time, hasn't it? We've been close partners, and I particularly want to acknowledge the strong support that Tunisia has given over the years to the peace process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naturally, today we'll be discussing the state of the peace process, the concern that we all have for it. I'll be having an opportunity to brief the Foreign Minister on some of the elements of yesterday's discussion. I know we share the view that the parties must do everything they can to find areas of agreement; the only alternative, a return to violence, is simply not acceptable to any of us. Both sides reject such a course, as does the international community. I believe that both sides are committed to making the negotiations that will commence at Erez succeed, and I hope in the very shortest time possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're very grateful to the role that Tunisia has always played in the peace process. Most recently, and I think only a couple of weeks ago, Tunisia hosted the meeting to launch the new Middle East and Mediterranean Travel and Tourism Association, one of the things that came out of the Amman summit. I am confident that we'll continue to work together on the peace process, as we have on so many other issues. It's a very great pleasure to welcome you back, Habib, to have an opportunity to exchange views with you once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOREIGN MINISTER BEN YAHIA: Thank you, Mr. Secretary; good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's nice to be back to Washington as usual, to do this pilgrimage every year back to Washington. This particular time is of certain importance to both of us, Mr. Secretary, to give back vigor to the peace process. That peace process we cherished, we built piece by piece, with patience, with a lot of good work, and it's for the last five years we have been together embarked on a very important, risky and difficult business, of making peace in the Middle East. I hope that with yesterday's summit, a new departure, new momentum is being gained, and we hope that Dennis Ross going back to the region this Sunday will help us put back the peace process on track, in order to reach the implementation of the agreements signed in Oslo and Washington and Cairo. Tunisia has always been committed to peace. Peace has its own dividend for everybody, but we insist that we should see concrete results, and the sooner the better, in order to avoid any (inaudible). We are always committed to peace. President Ben Ali has been instrumental in working very hard to maintain the momentum with all parties concerned. We hope that this will be the case this time, in order for us to face next year, the next century, with plenty of hope for peace in the region. Thank you, Mr.  Secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, are you making any plans yourself to travel to the Middle East prior to your Africa trip? Will you be in Erez on Sunday?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER: Let me say this about that. I've always held myself ready to go to the region when it would be helpful in moving the process forward. I think I feel particularly a responsibility to do that in connection with the talks about to begin at Erez, and so when it seems that I might be useful, when my presence there would be helpful in moving the process forward I'll certainly be prepared to go. I don't have any plans to do so at the present time, but I'm going to be watching the situation closely to see if things develop in a way that might make a trip by myself a constructive and positive step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Wouldn't you be making that decision today, sir?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER: I'm probably making it every day over the next several weeks as we watch the situation develop. The situation is very fresh, and really just unfolding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to agree on one thing, which is that the Israelis won out at the summit this week, and the Palestinians lost out because they didn't feel they gained anything from the Israelis. How do you react to that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER: I don't think it ought to be evaluated in terms of winners and losers. We have no illusions about the situation, but there was conversation between the two leaders, which had not been possible to have. If you think back to a week ago today, we had the bloodiest day on the West Bank within anybody's memory. Things are somewhat better now. I think the conversation that took place, the recommitment to a nonviolent future, the commitment to have intensive and indeed continuous negotiation, is a step forward. In that sense, everyone comes out a winner. But we've got a long way to go, there are difficult times ahead, and I think we need to see some results flowing from those negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks very much.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The Ethiopian airlines(EAL) yesterday took delivery of one of the five Fokker 50 aircraft it had ordered from the Dutch manufacturer which went bankrupt as one of its major share-holders withheld funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EAL will acquire the remaining four passenger aircraft before the end of this Ethiopian year, according to Dr. Ahmed Kello, chief executive officer of the EAL.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquisition of the aircraft will enable EAL to meet 90 per cent of the current demand for domestic air transportation, and at the same time will serve as an important support to the airlines' international network, Dr.  Ahmed said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The development of EAL's domestic capacity &quot;will allow ETHIOPIAN' to fully cater for international visitors to the country enabling the airline to develop Ethiopia's tourism potential and strengthen the airline's competitive position, &quot; a press release by the airline stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fokker 50 purchase order has been cause for much concern and speculation as Fokker went bankrupt following an advance payment of 6.8 million dollars by EAl, of the total 66 million dollars cost of the five aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fokker 50 is a sturdy aircraft suitable for Ethiopian conditions and can carry 50 persons at a time, airline sources said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The Ethiopian Petroleum Corporation said here yesterday that the price of fuel in Ethiopia is the least as compared to that in neighbouring Sudan, Kenya, Djibouti and Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Tadesse Girma, the corporation's commercial department manager said in an interview with the Ethiopian News Agency on Tuesday that the price of a litre of gasoline in Ethiopia at present is birr 2.33, while it is birr 3.40 in Kenya, birr 3 in Sudan, 5.70 in Djibouti and birr 2.60 in Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Djibouti the price of a litre of gasoline and kerosene is birr 2.56 whereas the same amount of gasoline sells at only 83 cents and kerosene at birr 1.31 in Ethiopia, he added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ato Taddess, the world market price of a barrel of crude oil including its transportation cost, was 17.3 dollars in July 1996, adding it has now shown a drastic increase to 22 dollars a barrel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in the price of petroleum in Ethiopia is simply a drop in an ocean as compared to the increase in the price of the commodity in the world market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian Petroleum Corporation buys both crude and refined oil by international auction every six months he said, adding most of the time Middle East countries such as Saudi Arabia win the bid. The country also imports fuel from Singapore, the manager added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crude oil Ethiopia imports is refined at the Assab Refinery and 39-40 million birr is spent annually for the purpose, Ato Taddesse told the agency.  The manager said the total cost for refining is covered by the governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia and the sale of derivatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Produced at the Assab Refinery are butane, gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil, he pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diesel oil is widely used in Ethiopia for transportation, operating electric generators, grinding mills and other purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he said about 80 tank trucks have transported 2,500 cubic metre of fuel to Bahir Dar, Gondar and Kombolcha towns to fill in the reserve deposits of the corporation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya - Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi has secured the release of an Australian pilot, Justin Fraser, from captivity in Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi handed over the 24-year-old pilot to Australian High Commissioner John Trotter at a brief ceremony at state house on Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraser, held for 129 days, was arrested on May 25 in Hudur by forces loyal to the late Gen. Mohammed Farah Aideed, on suspicion of espionage. He was flying from Belet Wein to Mandera in north eastern Kenya when his plane developed mechanical problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belet Wein is controlled by a faction different from Aideed's United Somali Congress/Somali National Alliance (USC/SNA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After fruitless efforts to secure his release, the Australian government sought the help of Moi. The president then negotiated with the new USC/SNA leader, Hussein Mohammed Aideed, the son of the late general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As requested, I am releasing the Australian pilot to your excellency's custody after granting him pardon,&quot; Aideed said in his letter to Moi dated Oct. 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following his freedom, Fraser said: &quot;Words alone cannot express the depth of my gratitude to President Moi. What he has done for me, a non-Kenyan, is something I could not expect. It is difficult to appreciate the value of freedom until you lose it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BANJUL, Gambia - The latest guest in Clive Barlow's bird garden at the Atlantic beach hotel in Banjul, the Gambian capital, was a little greenbul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British ornithologist brought the tiny bird from the remnants of what used to be a rain forest in this tourism-dependent West African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Barlow, greenbuls live in &quot;climax forests&quot;, remnants of which are found in the Gambia, Kakamega in Kenya and several other parts of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For two weeks in September, this zoology graduate from Durham University in the United Kingdom, was keenly watching the greenbul's behavior in a completely new man-made habitat, within the confines of the hotel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The greenbul has special ecological requirements -- plant diversity and harmonious forest shade and ecology. If it likes it, it will stay. Two weeks on, it is singing very well,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ascertain its continued presence among the 136 species that have colonized the Atlantic Hotel mini-forest, Barlow plays a greenbul-taped sound on a small radio cassette recorder placed at his flat's balcony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the greenbul hears the sound of another early in the morning, it approaches in a combative spirit to protect its zone. But this has to be done for a short period to avoid raising suspicions in its mind,&quot; said the professional bird watcher and researcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After working as a bird curator in the Britain and France, Barlow moved to the Gambia in 1985. Ever since, he has strived to learn and promote environmental protection &quot;with the help of a host of Gambians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He particularly mentioned Fumike Sarr, Atlantic Hotel's manager, who backed the idea of creating a bird garden &quot;which adds value to the other hotel services available for tourists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This area where a verdant forest oasis now stands used to be an uninteresting arid land. Since 1990, we have used sunshine and water to allow it to grow into a mini-natural reserve in the confines of the hotel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sanctuary has an observation hide which enables people to watch and take photographs or video films of the birds at close range without scaring them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We try to orient foreign bird watchers who are on African soil for the first time,&quot; says Balrow, whose ambition is to use birds to spread the message that Gambia is not only sunshine and sandy beaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the traveller or eco-tourist, China means pandas, Asia means Tigers, Tanzania and Kenya means elephants. In the same vein, Gambia could mean birds, &quot; said Barlow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His keen interest in birds has started to pay dividend. He has been commissioned by Christopher Helm of Pica Press in the UK, Sussex, to prepare a &quot;Field Guide To The Birds Of The Gambia.&quot; Helm prepared a similar guide for birds in East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The guide will expose Gambia's richness in bird species to the worldwide bird-watching community and encourage even more tourists to visit the Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barlow, who runs a bird-watching safari company in Banjul, commended the Gambian department of parks and wildlife management for accepting his proposal in 1985 that Tanji area, 20 km from Banjul, be declared an exclusive protected bird reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The department, under the wise leadership of Dr Almamy Camara, had an encouraging foresight by recognizing the importance of an increasing number of ecotourists to the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the ornithologist, in the long run, the Tanji bird reserve could represent to the Gambia what the Ngorongoro Crater means to Tanzania, Amboseli to Kenya or Krugger to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides attracting tourists, the Tanji bird reserve will also be used to teach school children about their country's rich biodiversity and how to conserve them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the time being, the bird garden at Atlantic hotel is being used as a prototype to show that habitat can be re-generated and once we restore what we had destroyed, some bird species and other creatures will come to colonize it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barlow said he was anxiously looking forward to this year's winter tourist season, which starts at the end of October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He plans to organize a 14-day bird watching expedition in the Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His major worry, however, was that media allegations of rigging in the recent presidential election of Sept. 26 could penalize the tourist industry as a whole, including bird-watching.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - At least two Nigerian pro-democracy activists, Chima Ubani and Ayo Opadokun, have been released by the military government as part of the country's 36th independence anniversary, their families said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members said that Ubani, secretary-general of the Democratic Alternative, was freed Wednesday after 15 months in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was quoted by Nigerian newspapers Friday as saying he had been questioned by the state security agents on his group's meeting in 1995 on the country's political crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ubani also claimed he was accused of travelling abroad to campaign for sanctions against Nigeria, a charge he said he denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opadokun, an official of the opposition National Democratic Coalition, was received Thursday by his family at Offa, in Nigeria's northern state of Kwara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no word of freedom was heard in respect of labor leader Frank Kokori.  His release was anticipated ahead of Tuesday's independence speech by the Nigerian head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least seven pro-democracy and opposition leaders were freed by the military government in June. That measure came on the eve of a London meeting by the British-led Commonwealth, which suspended Nigeria from its fold in November 1995 over alleged human rights abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, officials insisted the decision to release the detainees was not to placate any group, but in line with government's commitment to national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other detainees awaiting freedom include Lagos lawyers Gani Fawehinmi and Femi Falana. They were arrested early in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also the unresolved issue of the politician, Moshood Abiola, who claimed victory in the June 1993 presidential election. That poll was annulled by the last military regime of Gen. Irbahim Babangida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abiola is awaiting trial for treason after declaring himself president of Nigeria, in June 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Speaking of marriage, South African religious leaders say they would fully support President Nelson Mandela if he chose to make Graca Machel the next first lady of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most religious leaders who spoke to the Mail &amp; Guardian this week said they didn't want to interfere with Mandela's &quot;democratic rights&quot;, the general consensus was that &quot;any adult relationship should be sanctified by wedding vows&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Anglican archbishop Desmond Tutu has already made clear his hope that the leading couple would tie the knot. This week he was joined by several other religious leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Methodist Church Bishop Stanley Magoba said he didn't &quot;really think we can have a head of state in a relationship without marriage, but I don't want to pressure them&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhema Ministries Pastor Ray McCauley said he would &quot;very much like to see (Mandela) remarry. He deserves some comfort and companionship in his golden years&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orthodox Chief Rabbi Cyril Harris agreed, but said it was all up to the president: &quot;If he's of a mind to, yes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk spokesman Willie Botha said: &quot;They are adult people, and it's for them to decide. If they are having an adult relationship I would say get married. It's not only a political issue, but also a personal one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Hindu Maha Sabha secretary Rugbeer Kalideen also left it up to the president: &quot;As one of the great statesman, he has a right to marry if he chooses to do so. There's nothing to stop him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moulana Ahmed Kathrada of the Natal Jamiat Ul-Ulema said it was &quot;their life&quot; , but added that &quot;if anybody is committing adultery it will be wrong whether it's the president or someone else&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Church of England Bishop Joe Bell agreed: &quot;It's a personal decision, but we would condemn pre-marital sex,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Last week the Mail &amp; Guardian published details of a contract which Athletics South Africa (ASA) attempted to persuade the Olympic 800m silver medallist, Hezekiel Sepeng, to sign. It would perhaps have been naive to expect heads to roll as a result of the disclosures we made. The government's handling of Sarafina II has not set much of an example by way of personal responsibility where the misdeeds of officialdom is concerned.  Nevertheless, steps to deal with the athletics scandal are overdue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is now well known, ASA sought to tie Sepeng to an undertaking that he would not attempt to break the South African 800m record except at meetings staged by a favoured sponsor. ASA tried to argue that the contract was not a contract, but a &quot;discussion document&quot;. It offered as the &quot;proof&quot; the fact that the document was not signed. This week the M&amp;G provides further evidence which shows, incontrovertibly, that ASA drew up a contract with the intention of rigging races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to imagine a more serious charge which could be brought against a national sports federation. But in fact the scandal is even more serious than what might otherwise have been treated as a single misjudgment by ASA. For some time now those involved in athletics have spoken of a &quot; climate of fear&quot; surrounding the administration of the sport. The term &quot;mafia&quot; is to be heard in describing some of those in authority. Rumours have been circulating about financial transactions. Strong-arm tactics - verbal, if not physical - are alleged to have been used against athletes and their coaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This miasma of discontent has now been given startling substance by the extraordinary behaviour of ASA's chief executive officer, Bernard Rose, in trying to cover up the Sepeng rigging controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African sport is at a critical juncture. In pursuit of the non-racial ideal, we are in desperate need of black role models to give a lead to disadvantaged youth on the sports fields. Athletics has already thrown up two such heroes, in Hezekiel Sepeng and the Olympic marathon champion, Josia Thugwane. The antics of ASA are nothing less than a betrayal of their achievements and of the aspirations of sportsmen and women throughout the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There are strong arguments for South Africa's withdrawal from the arms trade. But - the decision having been made that we cannot afford to shut down the industry - it is difficult to understand the furious objections from some quarters at the proposed sale of weapons to the Rwandan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics who oppose weapons shipments to that tiny, tragic nation raise a number of objections. They say Rwanda is still effectively at war, its government is not democratic, and the supply of yet more guns will further destabilise the region, including war-torn Burundi and chaotic Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To some extent this is true. Rwanda has never had a democratic government and is unlikely to enjoy one for many years. The present administration cannot even be said to command popular support. Real power lies with the Tutsi minority, particularly the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the government came to power having ousted one of the most obscene regimes since the Nazis. The former Hutu government oversaw the extermination of an estimated 800 000 Tutsis - about 10% of Rwanda's population - in a matter of weeks in 1994. The killers should be on trial. Instead, they are trying to fight their way to power again on the backs of two million Hutus in camps which are less refugee centres than bases for destabilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hutu militias and soldiers, who so pitilessly murdered even the youngest Tutsi, regularly raid Rwanda from Zaire. They murder survivors of the genocide, local officials and even their fellow Hutus in order to perpetuate division and instability. If neighbouring Burundi collapses into a full-blown civil war, Hutu extremists plan to push the conflict across the border into Rwanda. The hand of Zaire's dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, is clearly visible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under such circumstances, there is a strong moral argument for helping the Rwandan government defend the country against those who are intent on reviving genocide. Nothing could be more destabilising to the region than if these criminals were to seize power once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if South Africa is going to sell arms to the rest of Africa, it must also shoulder the responsibilities that come with the trade. A crucial test looms with the visit next week by United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher. He will be pushing Washington's plan for a US-financed, African- manned standing military intervention force. If it gets off the ground, the force's first task will probably be in Rwanda's troubled neighbour, Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher will be looking for South African support and commitment. If we give it, we can claim to be peace-makers in Africa. If we fail to do so, we will stand accused of merely seeking to profit from the woes of the continent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cairo - Amal Farouk's screams keep her three children, mother and neighbours awake every night. If she falls asleep, the nightmare returns and she wakes screaming: &quot;No, please, I beg you, keep your hands off me, don't rape me!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amal (28) is one of many Egyptian women taken hostage and tortured by the authorities to collect evidence against men in their families, suspected Muslim militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's new strategy of targeting women, officials admit privately, is an unpleasant price to be paid in the all-out war against Islamic terrorists. The deliberate degradation of women by arrest, torture and sexual abuse is intended to break the spirit of male militants seeking to overthrow the government of Hosni Mubarak.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In our culture, the humiliation of a wife or mother or sister will break a man's back,&quot; says Dr Aida Seif al Dowla, a psychiatrist from the Cairo Centre for the Management and Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence, who confirms that women related to Islamic activists have been tortured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amal was arrested hours after police captured her husband, Ahmed al Sayid, who is now serving a 25-year sentence for an assassination attempt on Egypt's Minister of Information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the beginning the interrogators were nice to me. They wanted me to appear on television to condemn my husband as a lunatic and wife-beater. When I refused, they turned ugly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First they mocked me for wearing a veil. Then they blindfolded me, stripped me down to my underwear and hung me by my hands from a hook in the ceiling. There were at least seven men in the room and some of them were telling me how much they would enjoy raping me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As they taunted me, they whipped me with cable wire, kicked me in the stomach and sliced open my back with razors. This lasted for more than two hours. While I was in this room, I could hear my husband screaming in pain and shouting &quot;Ya awlad al sharameet ana marafsh aya haga. (You sons of bitches, I don't know anything.)&quot; It was obvious that they were torturing him.  '</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amal said that the following day an officer named Mahmoud Hosny had taken her to another room and stripped her naked. &quot;He told me I should divorce my husband and remarry. He said the government would pay me a lot of money if I signed a confession implicating my husband as a terrorist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I refused, he brought in another man and told him, 'This bitch is all yours. Rape her.' &quot; When the man began to undress, Amal shouted, &quot;Okay, okay, I will sign anything you want.&quot; Nine days later she was released without charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weeks later, Amal asked permission to attend her husband's trial in a military court - she wanted to tell the judges that her confession had been extorted under torture. Her request was denied for &quot;security reasons&quot;, but the judges later announced that they had accepted her written statement to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amal's lawyer, Montasr Zayat, filed a complaint against her interrogators with the Ministry of the Interior. The authorities responded by despatching a police squad to take Amal back into detention. They told her that she was being punished for trying to bring the police into disrepute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was held for 10 days, during which she was brutally tortured,&quot; said Zayat. &quot;They wanted her to withdraw her complaint and to say that it was all lies. They used electric shocks and one of the interrogators sexually abused her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On her release she had to be hospitalised for two weeks and received psychiatric care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am 66 years old and I have never seen such savagery in my life,&quot; said Amal's mother, Um Mohammed. &quot;What they are doing to these women is not only against Islam, it is also against human rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Um Mohammed is now nursing her daughter and her six-year-old grandson, Mohammed, whose teeth were broken when he tried to prevent police from taking away his mother. &quot;The officer who came to our house kicked him in the mouth,&quot; said Um Mohammed. &quot;There was blood everywhere because most of his teeth were smashed. They refused to take him to hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zayat said the strategy will backfire. &quot;By holding women as hostages, the police are inviting more violence, and even retaliation. Some police officers have been assassinated after being accused of torturing the wives and sisters of Muslim fundamentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These Islamic groups have a special sensitivity when it comes to women. As far as they are concerned, women represent a red line that should not be crossed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zayat and his Egyptian legal colleagues say the harassment of women has increased in the past two years. They accuse the government of misusing emergency regulations which allow the authorities to hold suspects for six months without trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jihan Ibrahim Abdel Hamid, a mother of three, has been in detention since August 1994. She claims that her only &quot;crime&quot; is her husband's alleged involvement in the assassination of Dr Farag Foda, Egypt's most outspoken critic of Islamic terrorists. Police suspect her of hiding weapons, but she has never been brought before a judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a civil court ordered her release earlier this year, Abdel Hamid was transferred to police headquarters in Cairo. There she was served with a new detention order for a further six months. The Cairo Centre for Women's Legal Aid has written to the Minister of the Interior asking for her release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We believe there is no justification for Jihan's continued captivity,&quot; said representative Izzah Suleiman. &quot;We are very concerned at this phenomenon of increased state violence against women. I have met three other women who had miscarried as a result of physical and psychological torture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the women who miscarried was Fatima Muawad, the wife of Safwat, one of the leaders of the Gamayat Islamia Fundamentalist Movement. Muawad was three months pregnant when she was arrested and taken to the Abdin police station in Cairo. A medical report provided by her lawyer confirms that she had lost her baby as a result of being kicked repeatedly in the stomach. She was never formally charged. Police told her she would remain in prison until her fugitive husband had been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, police arrested 12 other women for similar reasons in Cairo's Ain Shams district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of these women, whose ages range from 21 to 55, were kicked in the stomach and face, and hung upside down at the police station,&quot; said Zayat. &quot; We have established that police General Fadi Habashi personally supervised their interrogation. They were all wives, mothers or sisters of suspected Muslim fundamentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have now filed an official complaint against this general, with supporting medical reports and affidavits. The Ministry of the Interior has promised an investigation, but so far no disciplinary action has been taken.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministry officials blame fundamentalists for involving their women. &quot;Many of these women have been officially recruited to the so- called jihad,&quot; a senior security officer said. &quot;We have even discovered that some of them actively participated in terrorist attacks, including firing at policemen and planting bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are also used for surveillance, intelligence-gathering and carrying messages for their husbands. In some cases, they even dress in the latest Western fashions to avoid arousing suspicion.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sources claim that most of the women in detention have been trained to use firearms. When police raided a fundamentalist hideout in Asyut, wives joined their husbands in returning fire. The nine-hour battle ended with the death of Ahmed Zaki Sharif, one of Egypt's most wanted terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am against violence and I have never taken part in any terrorist act,&quot; said Amal. &quot;Don't believe the government when they say women are being recruited by the Islamic movement. What they will not tell you is that women are not accepted as members of Islamic groups. Our role, according to the holy book, is to look after our children and our families. Nothing can break us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arusha, Tanzania - Luc de Temmerman's defence strategy is as brazen as the crime itself. Standing before the first genocide trial since Nuremburg, the Belgian lawyer denied there ever was any slaughter of Rwanda's Tutsis. And if there was a genocide, then the world has got it all wrong. The real victims were the Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is going to come out clearly that it is not Hutus who are guilty of this so-called genocide,&quot; De Temmerman said before the trial. &quot;We are convinced there was no genocide. It was a situation of mass killings in a state of war where everyone was killing their enemies.&quot; The international tribunal on Rwanda opened briefly in Arusha, Tanzania last week and was postponed for a month. But in those two days, the court and survivors were given a disturbing insight into defence tactics when the trials resume.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of the deposed Hutu extremist regime have disingenuously tried portray the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis in 1994 as a spontaneous tribal uprising which they tried to prevent, not encourage. De Temmerman is rewriting history differently. He is the most vocal and belligerent of the defence lawyers, and he makes no bones about the contempt in which he holds the international tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The goal here is political, not to find justice and truth,&quot; he told the court. Twice during a single hearing, the judges rapped him over the knuckles after he swore in French. Afterwards, De Temmerman accused the judges of being part of a vast international conspiracy against Hutus and said he was going to use a Belgian law to charge them with crimes against humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stocky, puffy-faced Belgian lawyer represents Georges Rutaganda, the vice-president of the notorious interahamwe Hutu militia which spearheaded the genocide.  Rutaganda is dying of an undisclosed disease, widely speculated to be Aids, and is unlikely to make it to a full trial. De Temmerman brushed aside prosecution evidence that the former interahamwe leader despatched Tutsis to barricades where the militia tortured, raped and cut their victims to pieces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr Rutaganda is accused of sending Tutsis to roadblocks that were guarded by the interahamwe. Fine. You can send people to roadblocks and they won't necessarily be killed,&quot; he claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An incredulous prosecution lawyer scoffed loudly. Others wondered just how many Tutsis had survived the barricades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But De Temmerman is in court to defend more than just his sick client. He has long been counsel to the family of the slain Rwandan president, Juvenal Habyarimana, whose assassination launched the genocide. Although Habyarimana is dead, he and his family are also very much on trial for their role in setting the stage for genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other things, De Temmerman is keen to push the theory that Habyarimana was assassinated by a French mercenary in league with Tutsi rebels. More sober minds believe the president was murdered by extreme Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But above all, the Belgian lawyer is intent on challenging the very basis of the charge. &quot;The tribunal must establish what genocide is. What are we doing here today?&quot; he remarked to the judges. While at times claiming there was no genocide, he is equally comfortable with another form of revisionism - that the victims were Hutus not Tutsis. &quot;There are a million people dead, but who are they? They are 800 000 Hutus and 200 000 Tutsis. Everyone was killing but the real victims are the Hutus. So they've got this so-called genocide all wrong,&quot; he claimed outside the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other defence lawyers are none too comfortable with their colleague's tactics. Johan Scheers, who represents the first of the accused to go on trial, not only believes the genocide took place but says he is not yet convinced of his client's innocence. Still, Scheers has adopted his bulldozing approach. Last week he accused the prosecution of withholding evidence and threatened to walk off the case unless he was given more time to prepare his defence of Jean-Paul Akayesu, a former mayor accused of genocide and crimes against humanity. And he shares De Temmerman's scepticism that there can be a fair trial. &quot;They have to convict Akayesu. He is the first one to go on trial so they can't possibly let him go,&quot; Scheers said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Marriage law will change significantly if proposals tabled by the Law Commission last week are accepted. Yet the integration of customary and common law has complex implications for both traditional communities and society at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Law Commission's issue paper on the &quot;Harmonisation of Common Law and Indigenous Law&quot; cites a dozen potential areas of conflict between the constitutional rights of the new South Africa and the rules and practices of customary marriages. Project leader Professor Thandabantu Nhlapo, however, argues the current situation holds far greater contradictions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was always an insult to my parents to be told they were just co- habitating because the old colonial-based legal system did not recognise their marriage. Our starting point is that non-recognition of customary marriages is totally unacceptable under the present Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constitutional ban on cultural and religious discrimination implies an end to the days when only Christian and civil marriages gave legal legitimacy to a family unit, but the extension of recognition to other forms across South Africa's rich cultural tapestry poses as many questions as it answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights lawyers this week agreed the present situation is untenable, but argued the legalisation of polygamy posed potential conflicts between cultural freedoms and the right to gender equality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenine Hicks, a representative of Durban's Community Law Centre who has worked extensively in rural KwaZulu-Natal, said the commission was &quot;jumping the gun&quot; by forwarding proposals before researching the views of rural women affected by polygamy and other aspects of customary marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's outrageous to say only Christian or civil marriages are recognised, but rural women I've worked with say polygamy as a system has to go,&quot; she said. &quot;Traditional men say its essential to being a Zulu, but the women say it oppresses them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nhlapo agreed the commission would have to &quot;walk a political tightrope&quot; on the issue and that the consultation period may need to be extended to canvass sufficient views, but warned against allowing the polygamy debate to pose the main obstacle to the recognition of customary marriages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission questioned whether the practice of polygamy could be balanced with the Constitution's gender equality clause, but warned against an outright ban on polygamous marriages as this would be &quot;extremely difficult to enforce. Moreover, there is some evidence that in a patriarchal world, where there is no economic, social or political equality between men and women, it is the institution of marriage itself, whether monogamous or polygamous, which disadvantages women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, the commission argued the principle of equality would &quot; frequently be in conflict with the patriarchal principles pervading much of customary law&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some potential conflicts included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the customary provision requiring a woman to gain the support of her guardian for marriage;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* whether lobola should be allowed to influence the validity of the marriage;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the provision in the &quot;official&quot; version of customary law which deems wives of customary marriages as &quot;minors&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the lack of decision-making power of women on issues such as birth control, guardianship of children and the purchase or alienation of family property;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the lack of protection for family members from &quot;inept or unreasonable conduct&quot; by the head of the family;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the wife's forfeiture of family property upon divorce;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the lack of maintainence provisions within customary law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nhlapo said he believed it was possible to remove the patriarchal aspects of customary law while keeping the institution intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we are going to do is dignify traditional families based on a particular worldview of kinship, but also say, 'This is 1996 and if you had practised oppression in the past, then stop it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this would help to advance customary law, which was presently a mix of widely- varying &quot;living law&quot; or oral custom and codified or &quot;official&quot; customary law as entrenched in kwaZulu-Natal: &quot;Customary law has been neglected and has not kept pace with changing social circumstances. Removing the discrimination against it presents the chance to improve it and bring it up to date,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nhlapo said the commission would begin &quot;scouring the countryside&quot; for views which would influence its final report. Legislation was expected to be tabled by mid-1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Swedish government is no closer to proving a South African link in the assassination of prime minister Olof Palme than it was when he was gunned down one night on a Stockholm sidewalk 10 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost every day since convicted police killer Eugene de Kock told the court last week he knew who killed Palme there have been accusations and denials from those named in connection with his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The various men accused of killing Palme are known to investigators in Stockholm and South Africa's National Intelligence Agency. They were a motley crew of two-bit operators in lowly jobs in South Africa's clumsy intelligence services.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The names of Palme's &quot;assassin&quot; come from two main sources, via various conduits, embellished in the telling in a multitude of bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One version comes from a low-ranking former security policeman, &quot;Riaan&quot; Stander. The second comes from De Kock's wild but loyal friend, Peter Casselton, who worked for South Africa's spymasters, mostly in London, for years. One name is common to both men's stories about Palme: former spy Craig Williamson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson continues to deny any involvement in the Palme affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Stander version of events goes like this: Williamson, as boss of a military intelligence operation called Longreach (Pty) Ltd, sent former Selous Scout Ant White to shoot Palme. He says White was assisted in the assassination by British &quot;spy&quot; Mike Irwin, who also worked for Longreach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stander sometimes produces a document, an air waybill, which he says was for silencers sent to Irwin and White who were practising their marksmanship in the Seychelles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former hit-squad policeman Dirk Coetzee, who has had a busy time with the press this week, first heard about this version of Palme's assassination from Stander. It was Coetzee who reportedly named White last weekend as Palme's killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White, running a furniture factory on the outskirts of shabby, dirty Beira in Mozambique, was a ruthless killer for Ian Smith's Rhodesia. But his reputation transcends even those most gruesome war stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists piecing together apartheid's secret wars have heard tales of extraordinary pursuits in connection with White. Of how he shipped a warehouse full of elephant tusks out of Burundi. Of how he shot out all Mozambique's elephants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson confirms White was a founder member of Longreach. He says White didn't know at first the company was a military intelligence front reporting to Brigadier &quot;Tolletjie&quot; Botha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mozambique's Frelimo government has sheltered White for years. A senior Frelimo intelligence officer in Maputo told the Mail &amp; Guardian in 1992 that White became close to Frelimo during the latter stages of the war against Renamo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson said from Angola on Wednesday that he hired Stander several months after Palme's death to work for him as a security guard, firstly in Longreach and then in the odd company GMR, named after its fabulously rich owner, Giovanni Mario Ricci.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson said he sacked Stander in connection with allegations of fraud about a year after he hired him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casselton's version of the Palme assassination, according to Williamson, involves right-wing Swede Bertil Weden, now living in Cyprus, who has repeatedly denied any involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weden's name was first published in connection with the Palme assassination in The Guardian five years ago. He has also been the subject of lengthy investigative reports in Swedish newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weden was acquitted in a British court 14 years ago in connection with selling information to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson said this week he first met Weden in South Africa in about 1980.  &quot;He was bright. He told me he was a journalist and he knew the political differences between the African National Congress and Pan Africanist Congress.  I recruited him and sent him to London as part of the European operation I was setting up. I think we paid him about o1 000 a month, quite good money in those days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weden reported to Casselton who was based in London. But his job ended after his appearance in court in 1982. &quot;He was blown after that, no use any more,&quot; Williamson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casselton was jailed in Britain after being found guilty in connection with burglaries of ANC offices in London. Williamson said he paid Casselton R100 000 as a gratuity after he was released from prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casselton was also involved, together with Williamson, in blowing up the ANC's offices in London in 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scandinavian newspapers reported on Thursday that Casselton &quot;confessed&quot; to Swedish embassy officials in Pretoria on Wednesday that Weden had told him he had killed Palme.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - At least six police brigadiers and colonels, named in the trial of Eugene de Kock, have broken ranks and approached the truth commission about the possibility of applying for amnesty as they are disillusioned with the way the generals are handling their submission to the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth body has also taken a top-level decision to scale down its public hearings and speed up findings that identify perpetrators of abuse. These developments lie behind a statement by its chairman, Desmond Tutu, that the institution has now reached a turning point in its history.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinary people have had their chance to tell their stories and the commission will now use its subpoena powers - its &quot;steel fist&quot; - to answer the burning questions that have been raised in the public hearings, Tutu said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources inside the commission confirmed that the brigadier-and-colonel cadre of leadership from the police force had been jolted into approaching the commission by the string of allegations emerging from the De Kock trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police generals have so far tried to hold their camp together by offering to make a general submission to the commission about the role of the police in some 50 unsolved political crimes committed in the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least six of their colleagues, likely to be followed by more, are disillusioned by the inability of the generals to come up with a comprehensive submission and strategy that covers them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also fear that further trials being prepared by the Transvaal attorney general's office will increase the prospect of their being linked to human rights abuse - after the December cut-off date for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while it appears that a united front in the ranks of senior police commanders is beginning to break down, there is little sign of a similar development in the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military generals have been able to delay their submission to the truth commission without prompting panic among colleagues lower down the rung, as it appears that General Magnus Malan and his fellow accused in the KwaMakutha trial have a good chance of being let off when the Supreme Court makes its judgment next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military generals are clearly waiting for the court's decision so that they can use a not-guilty verdict to maximum effect in their submission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a ruling will also bolster a belief, currently circulating in some ranks of the security forces, that the state does not have the resources to pinpoint perpetrators of past abuse and prosecute them - especially as the Malan trial was investigated by a crack police unit and an experienced team in the AG's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The critical lesson in these developments is that the most powerful mechanism for forcing the candour out of the men who ran the death squads is an effective and well-resourced criminal justice system that can follow up the promise to punish those who don't come clean.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An African National Congress senator acting as an official observer in the European Parliament (EP) last week persuaded African and Caribbean countries not to support a resolution from the Green Party demanding that large amounts of toxic mercury waste dumped in KwaZulu-Natal be returned to Europe for disposal there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Green Party managed to steer a resolution through the EP in Brussels last week calling on its members states - especially the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain - to take back consignments of more than 500 tons of mercury waste sent by these countries to the Thor Chemicals plant in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ANC observer Cheryl Gillwald convinced African countries not to support adoption of the resolution in a joint assembly of European and ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) countries, according to sources in Brussels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It appears Cheryl Gillwald was not feeling too comfortable with the subject and maybe does not know what the South African government's position (on the question of importing toxic wastes) is at the moment,&quot; said an EP official who deals with North- South relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She convinced the other ACP states to take a negative attitude towards the resolution. In order not to have the resolution voted down, the Greens withdrew the proposal (from the joint ACP-European Union assembly).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the resolution pushed through the EP notes that more than 20 workers have either been killed or disabled at Thor's Cato Ridge plant where the imported toxins were simply stored instead of being properly reprocessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The case is classified by Greenpeace as the worst incident in the waste trade yet discovered, as no other case investigated by that organisation showed 'such abuse of an economically dependent, under-educated workforce'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from demanding that the material be sent back to Europe, the motion calls on all European countries to help provide South Africa with the technology needed to &quot;cope with its present toxic waste crisis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also calls on South Africa to support Article 39 of the Lom, Convention, which imposes a tight embargo on movement of hazardous wastes between ACP and European countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Green organisations in South Africa are up in arms because South African negotiators in Brussels have been reluctant to endorse this article during talks with European countries about becoming members of the convention, which governs terms of trade between Europe and developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Green Party politicians in the EP say that Pretoria's embassy in Brussels had acknowledged South Africa still imports &quot;hazardous waste for recycling from a number of countries in the region&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Albertyn, national co-ordinator of the Environmental Justice Networking Forum (EJNF), says his organisation is disappointed by Gillwald's apparent effort to block support from developing countries for the resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albertyn says Minister of Trade and Industry Alec Erwin has not responded to repeated requests to meet with the EJNF - an umbrella body that represents more than 280 environmental, union and civic organisations - to discuss his ministry's reluctance to end imports of hazardous waste from the rest of Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The minister appears to be giving us the run around and is being extremely elusive.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Natal academic Francie Lund thought she was bringing good and bad news when she presented a report in Parliament last week, bearing internationally acclaimed proposals for a new system of child welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the headlines have screamed only the bad: &quot;Shock to single mums&quot;; &quot; Plans to slash child grants&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am bemused,&quot; Lund said. &quot;I understand that political parties could get some mileage out of the report but it undermines the whole transformation process if new ideas are going to be judged with the old mental tools.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lund, who heads a committee commissioned by the Welfare Ministry to investigate maintenance payment to mothers and grandmothers for family care, believes the recommendations in her report lay the basis for a new system of child welfare which will improve the lot of the poorest children, although in the short term it will rob the coloured and Indian poor to give to the poorest, which in most cases are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a think-tank at the Itala Game Reserve and brought in top South African and international experts - people who have had hands-on experience of development programmes and reforming social security systems and they were extremely excited about these recommendations. In fact, it was said as we left: 'This is the most exciting thing happening in social security in the world right now,' &quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experts who complimented the report included the World Bank's Nicholas Barr who had participated in the reform of the former Soviet Union's social security system and Richard Morgan of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the media have all but ignored the better recommendations. The Lund Report recommends that a flat-rate benefit for children be paid to the child's care-giver, according to a simple means test. A condition for the grant would be that the child is registered at birth. Another recommendation is that the grant be paid to the care-giver through a bank or post office account, rather than over a counter. This aspect is seen to be particularly novel in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is part of an international trend of encouraging poorer, marginalised people to be drawn into large financial institutions,&quot; Lund said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's really positive because through this the people can learn about banking and saving and about interest rates, they can use the maintenance deposit as a tiny bit of collateral in other ventures, and this could lead hopefully to better money management,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another novel recommendation is to tie the state's payment to a commitment by the grant's receiver to certain health practices such as immunisation and growth monitoring. This activity would complement the Health Department's programme for free public health-care for mothers and children under six, and is expected to reduce levels of infant mortality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources in government indicate that the Lund Report will be looked on favourably when it is discussed in Cabinet. The Justice Department has already set up a taskgroup to implement the report's recommendations on the private maintenance system which works through the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there is some nervousness about what impact it will have on the African National Congress's political battle against the National Party in the Western Cape. The NP could use the recommendations as fodder to win more coloured votes, because the recommendations mean many coloured and Indian women who are currently claiming maintenance will no longer be able to do so and will be pushed below the bread-line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ANC also has to remember its election promises of a &quot; better life for all&quot; and it knows it has to target the black population for the 1999 elections, and to fulfil the constitutional requirements of the Bill of Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To bring equity to the system would mean extra government spending of between R5- billion and R20-billion. With the current belt-tightening, this would be impossible. In the 1995/1996 fiscal year, the state paid over R1- billion in grants for maintenance, which is 12% of the social security budget.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The African National Congress's Western Cape provincial conference last weekend failed to provide a blueprint for victory for the party in the 1999 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates who had hoped their organisation's biennial conference would provide a solution for its inability to attract coloured voters left dissatisfied as not one resolution on the thorny issue was debated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections for a new leadership dominated the proceedings, with almost the entire first day taken up by a battle for positions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With most of Saturday spent electing a new provincial leadership, and a breakdown in administration on Sunday which meant delegates did not receive copies of resolutions, the conference was far from successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once again, we have had yet another ANC conference almost completely dominated by leadership battles instead of devising a political programme,&quot; said a frustrated delegate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had hoped this one would have been different, but the ANC in the Western Cape seems doomed to remain morassed in personality rather than programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A document titled A political plan for the Western Cape drafted by a group headed by the ANC's new provincial treasurer, Ebrahim Rasool, was circulated among delegates but did not become a major discussion point as many had hoped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It suggested a new strategic path for the ANC, saying the coloured community had to be at the centre of any strategy the conference devised.  Although there was heated debate in a commission on political strategy, without photo-copying facilities to circulate resolutions to delegates, the discussions were not translated into an action plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outgoing provincial leader Chris Nissen attempted in his address to set the tone for action. &quot;It is important to give due recognition to the coloured people of this province,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Gone are the days when we talk about so- called coloureds. They are not superior to anyone or inferior, they have a culture to be proud of. The ANC needs to recognise this and give them its full support. The ANC must play a role in bringing communities together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who delivered the keynote speech, reiterated that the ANC should win over the coloured constituency in the Western Cape, but did not spell out a strategy of how to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other major issue dominating Western Cape politics - crime in the province - Mbeki merely referred delegates to the ANC's January 8 speech which called on members to engage in popular mobilisation to fight crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A resolution on affirmative action - a rallying point for coloureds who believe the ANC does not represent their interests - failed to find support at the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It proposed the establishment of an affirmative action commission in the province to which people could complain if they were unfairly excluded from employment on the grounds that the job was not available to coloured workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution, like most prepared by branches and commissions for conference, was referred to the provincial executive committee for debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was some work done at the conference, though. Delegates adopted 10 resolutions, including one on crime which called for anti-crime units to be established in branches and for the ANC to lobby for additional funds for crime prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates also resolved to revive the masakhane campaign and lobby for adequate billing procedures in townships, incentive schemes for residents who pay for services and for payment offices to be opened at weekends and after hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most delegates appeared satisfied with the outcome of the leadership elections which saw Justice Minister Dullah Omar elected as chairman, NomaIndia Mfeketo as deputy chairman, James Ngculu re-elected secretary, Marius Fransman as deputy secretary and Rasool as treasurer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - African National Congress members of Parliament have threatened a parliamentary inquiry into the party's appointment of consultants if Deloittes and Touche win a R1-million contract for the transformation of the Correctional Services Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This contract, should it go to Deloittes and Touche, may be the last straw on the camel's back for many MPs who are dissatisfied that high-flying consultants have moved into ministries, eclipsing the party's traditional advisers: non-governmental organisations (NGOs), academics and the Shell House policy unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC MP Melanie Verwoerd said Parliament's Constitutional Development Portfolio Committee had openly berated the department for spending millions on consultancy firms, and had instructed them to employ NGOs to do the work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Parliamentary Committee on Defence has probed the awarding of a contract for the transformation of the South African National Defence Force to Deloittes and Touche, and while the company still holds the R1-million contract, the mutterings and probing continue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee is to hold public hearings into &quot;government by consultants&quot; on October 9, when MPs will grill senior public service officials on the use of consultants. The hearings arise from an auditor general's report, released last month, which indicated government had no mechanism to monitor or gauge the use, cost or output of consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, ANC ministers brought in consultants, initially, to compensate for the ineptitude of old-guard public servants. Newspaper reports have set the annual figure on government consultancy at a R100-million, although this figure is not official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some of the ill-feeling in the ANC might arise from jealousy of consultants' salaries and their slice of the budget, much resentment stems from concern about their influence on government policy. The accusation made in Parliament's corridors is that the executive, supported by its consultants, is ignoring party resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One ANC MP complained that the transformation process had become government- driven, rather than party-driven. &quot;But it's not a sinister drive from a narrow elite in government who happen to have a strong position in the NEC (national executive council), it's also because the ANC's structures and Shell House have been weakened,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other ANC members said they were frustrated that there was no tangible ANC policy, and that the ANC's policy unit, based in Shell House and headed by acting secretary general Cheryl Carolus had been marginalised. Neither Carolus nor government ministers commented on the issue. However, Tebogo Phadu, a policy-maker in Shell House, confirmed that there were tensions between government ministries and his unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a parallel process of research going but our impact is uneven as is our capacity to engage in government issues. The government processes are very rapid and people are pushing ahead fast and sometimes we cannot keep up with developments. But the ANC is trying to restructure itself properly so that it can take a coherent position on issues,&quot; Phadu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement of the macro-economic plan, which was done initially over the heads of the ANC's alliance with the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party (SACP), burnt the alliance's intellectuals and provoked calls for ministers to return to their traditional policy base in Shell House. This was confirmed by SACP executive member Jeremy Cronin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, there is a problem ... since April 1994, the ANC's capacity has been weakening and this has been the consequence of a shift of ANC cadres into the government and into the private sector. ... We need to get people back into coherent structures for policy-making,&quot; Cronin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of the relationship between the ANC in government and the ANC as a party will become more important as the 1999 elections approach and the ministers turn to the party to mobilise support for their re- election.  Cronin is optimistic that ANC ministers are realising consultants are driving a wedge between them and the party, and will mend their ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are others who take a more pessimistic view. These are ANC advisers who now find their places in decision-making taken by bureaucrats or professional consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, a number of people who worked on the ANC's health policy before and during the elections have been dismayed that Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma has rejected ANC policy and ignored the research done in its making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A health expert who was involved in advising the ANC before the elections said this week: &quot;Many of us are dismayed that the minister is using consultants from overseas who do not have knowledge of local conditions and there is a danger of an imposition of inappropriate strategies that worked elsewhere but would not be right here. ... We are also dismayed at the extent of duplication of the research we did prior to the elections, and in many cases it is not properly done. There is a depth of health expertise in the country which is being ignored, and for my part I have retreated to my ivory tower.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are objections, too, that expertise from the Development Bank and from the South African office of the World Bank are being leaned on more and more, to the exclusion of home-grown policy-makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ron Greenstein, a senior researcher in the Education Policy Unit, believes that many traditional ANC members and advisers who have been absorbed into government have lost touch with the masses, as they wrestle with the state's unwieldy structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main policy-making players are new bureaucrats who have reached an accord with old bureaucrats and implemented an internal compromise on policy.  ... There is no channel for the popular feeling on policy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Moves to convene a summit between the African National Congress and its alliance partners, the South African Communist Party (SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), have been given fresh impetus by a call for such a parley from one of the country's most powerful trade unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call - part of a resolution passed at last week's congress of the 232 000-strong National Union of Metalworkers (Numsa) - will be tabled at the next meeting of Cosatu's central executive committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numsa general secretary Enoch Godongwana is not expecting any opposition to the notion, not even within the ANC itself. &quot;We have been talking about the need for such a summit for a long time,&quot; he said this week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution also gave the union's central executive committee the power to decide whether belonging to the alliance is still worthwhile. This was the compromise that saw delegates, after heated debate, turn back from a 1993 decision that the alliance should end once the ANC was in power and that a workers' party should be formed. In itself, however, the decision sends the ANC a strong signal about members' unhappiness with the way things are going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the debate, three Numsa regions argued for the alliance to end. But KwaZulu- Natal, the Western Cape and Wits Central were defeated by the union's other six regions, which felt the alliance should continue and be strengthened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nature of the alliance has been undergoing continual redefinition since the 1994 elections. But increasingly, the government has been taking significant policy decisions on its own, rather than as the ANC acting in concert with its alliance partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Predictably, this has not sat well with organised labour. While it is clear that Cosatu has made significant political gains through being in the alliance, the ANC also needs the unions for electoral campaigning and support on policy issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But times have changed. As Numsa national president Mtutuzeli Tom pointed out, the union's members found themselves in a world of &quot;hard choices&quot;, where &quot;progress&quot; meant no strikes or wage demands, accepting job insecurity and privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What swung the debate against opting out of the alliance was that staying in it was seen to offer labour its best chance of impacting on government policy, particularly economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SACP deputy chairman Blade Nzimande spelt it out: &quot;The political strength of the broad liberation movement, the tripartite alliance in particular, will determine the course of economic development that we follow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nzimande identified as &quot;perhaps the most serious and practical challenge&quot; facing the working class in the post-1994 era as organisational: what drove the alliance was the acceptance that the working class led it. &quot;The challenge is how to translate this into reality and take it beyond conference resolutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Factory struggles had to be linked to broader politics. &quot;This means that we need to increase our political propaganda on socialism as the ultimate solution to workers' problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workers had to strengthen their role in all the political formations of the alliance. &quot;We must not make the error, as some of our comrades do, of adopting a cynical attitude towards the ANC in particular,&quot; he said. The ANC remained the vehicle for attaining working-class goals at this stage; the working-class orientation of the ANC could be realised if organised workers, in particular, played their role.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - African National Congress members of Parliament are expressing growing concern with the organisation's leadership style, citing mismanagement of crises, a consolidation of central authority and a clampdown on internal dissent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian has interviewed a number of ANC MPs to gauge the climate in the organisation following the expulsion of Bantu Holomisa, the clash between Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, and other controversial recent events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many expressed a deep concern, believing the organisation is lurching from blunder to blunder, but the fact that not one would speak on the record is an indication of the state of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs described a &quot;climate of fear&quot; that inhibits criticism. &quot;You don't think about sticking your neck out for fear of getting your head chopped off,&quot; said one.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some cite ambition as the reason why voices are stilled. &quot;If people want to rise, they must be seen to be in good standing by certain people. Some people are keen to say certain things to enhance their positions - or because they already occupy a position they don't want to lose. The career aspect has never been a factor in ANC politics before - it's a totally new situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the heart of the problem appears to be the leadership style that has developed since the ANC came into government, dependent to an extent, on powerful personalities such as President Nelson Mandela and Mbeki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key ANC players in the government take decisions and then present them for endorsement - brooking little dissent in the process. &quot;There has been a merging of government and the organisation,&quot; said a source. &quot;The government takes the decision and it becomes an ANC decision. Internal democracy gets crushed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is deep concern over how candidates are being selected for key posts.  Whereas before cadres rose through party ranks, these days they are elevated within the organisation by virtue of government appointments, often on the grounds of loyalty rather than competence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government positions are used to manufacture leadership. Their status in government is used to elevate them within the organisation,&quot; said one MP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said another: &quot;People are not in high positions necessarily because they have merit or important constituencies, but because they enjoy the favour of those high up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has led to the marginalisation of ANC constitutional structures and those of the alliance with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and the South African Communist Party (SACP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One example cited is Mandela announcing on his return in May from courting German investors that privatisation was &quot;fundamental policy&quot; of the ANC - when the debate had not yet run its course internally. Another is the macro- economic framework, which was presented to the national executive committee virtually as a fait accompli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of consultation caused serious problems - and raised key questions about the future of the ANC/Cosatu/SACP alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ANC is still a broad liberation movement. The different class, racial and other tensions have to be held together. One can do this by keeping channels of debate open, and allowing positions to emerge, or by trying to control things, by clamping down on dissent - which turns the organisation into a pressure cooker,&quot; said an MP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The leadership has opted for the latter course. It's a defensive reaction, rooted in the sense that we've got power, but have we got the ability to deliver?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Decisions have to be made - it's accepted that the government must govern.  The problem is they're being taken on the run, in an ad hoc fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is driving the show, not the political structures. If you're running a broad liberation movement you need a consensus-making instrument so that you can drive your programmes and take people along with you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many MPs, the handling of the Holomisa affair illustrates the problems of political mismanagement. &quot;It could have been dealt with early on, far more efficiently. Instead, the ante was upped and it was driven to crisis,&quot; said one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some MPs contrast the firmness of the action taken against Holomisa with the relative lack of resolve displayed in dealing with recalcitrant bureaucrats, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the way in which Holomisa was dealt with has left a bad taste in many mouths. &quot;Many didn't agree with what Holomisa did and were critical of him before. But the way he was disciplined has left people with the sense that no- one is safe anymore,&quot; said one source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs also have in mind the experience of Pallo Jordan, seen to be a popular leader with independent and outspoken views. They were shocked when he was dropped from the Cabinet, and this was only partly allayed when he returned a few months later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The personality cult that has developed around Mandela means that criticism of his actions is all too readily seen as lSse- majest,. But while fear of incurring his displeasure may cause people to hold their tongues, this is not the whole problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Few people would want to take on Mandela head-on. He stands head and shoulders above anyone else in the organisation and he is also a man of principle,&quot; said one source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What concerns people is that if this authoritarian style becomes entrenched as a way of running things ... there are others who are less scrupulous than Mandela who will exploit it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others say the authoritarian style already allows for situations that are exploited to some people's advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's an intensity of feeling against what is seen as a closed group running things,&quot; said a source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For individual MPs, it throws up questions about their relevance, what they can achieve. They see themselves as ineffective. As a result, many are reviewing their positions. &quot;A lot of people are just treading water, waiting to see what happens,&quot; said a source. &quot;Others are getting out while they can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who can are leaving for new, more secure jobs - in the private sector, like Constitutional Assembly chairman Cyril Ramaphosa, or in the civil service. &quot;The stakes are much higher now - if you get chopped as an MP and you only have a high- school qualification what do you do?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Noseweek editor Martin Welz was lauded by media institutions this week after successfully defending himself against a defamation action in the Cape Town Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the marathon six-month trial has left Welz disillusioned with the media industry, which he says failed to support him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday, Judge JH Conradie ruled that American businessman Dr Robert Hall had sued Noseweek and the Cape Argus to &quot;sustain a colossal fraud&quot;. He dismissed Hall's R1,6- million defamation claim against the two newspapers with costs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hall told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week that he intended appealing Judge Conradie's ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Union of Journalists (SAUJ) president Sam Sole said the trial was a clear example of what was wrong with South African libel law: &quot;A rich crook was able to use hundreds of thousands of rand to put up the best possible legal shield to the truth, in the process crippling one of South Africa's most courageous independent publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That he failed was only due to the fact that Martin Welz is a truly exceptional journalist and was able to meet the burden of proof demanded by the courts - something many journalists, given the circumstances of their craft, would often struggle to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sole said the courts take their cue from a judgment in the Appellate Division against the Mail &amp; Guardian and Vrye Weekblad in 1993, where it was assumed journalists were guilty rather than innocent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Lothar Neethling, former head of the police forensics laboratory, had sued the two newspapers for libel after they reported allegations by former hit-squad policeman Dirk Coetzee that Neethling had supplied poison to kill anti-apartheid activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspapers successfully defended themselves, but the Appellate Division overturned the judgment on the grounds that Neethling was more believable and that newspaper readers had no legitimate interest in Coetzee's allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If any article is prima facie defamatory, it is from that point on assumed to be malicious, defamatory and untrue. It is then up to the publication to prove otherwise,&quot; Sole said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Freedom of Expression Institute's Media Defence Fund, which contributed significantly to Welz's legal costs, said the case had been a challenge to press freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund's co-ordinator, Alex Kuhn, said people like Hall take independent newspapers to court in an attempt to close them down. &quot;We contributed R110 000 towards Noseweek's legal costs and raised funds for additional money to cover the remainder. Without us, Welz would not have been able to have a legal defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're very pleased he won the case and that it didn't reverse any rulings against the media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welz said while he was pleased to have won, the trial had been a &quot;major trauma&quot; for him, both professionally and personally. &quot;I know this is a clich,, but it is at times like this that you find out who your friends are,&quot; he said. &quot;The SAUJ gave me tremendous moral support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My life was saved by the Freedom of Expression Institute and its concerned staff. It was amazing how little interest major publications take in press freedom. I pleaded with them for help and received no response whatsoever.  The absence of support from the industry was shocking, and has left me with few illusions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Several high schools near Johannesburg are under police guard after 14 pupils died recently in mysterious circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one incident a week ago, four men allegedly abducted two high school pupils attending funerals at KwaThema graveyard, 50km east of Johannesburg, shot one dead and wounded the other in the chest. But now pupils who attended the funeral say they do not remember the incident ever taking place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are baffled by the series of murders. Some parents are blaming the murders of their children on &quot;phantom&quot; gangs. This is the explanation given by the distraught parents of standard seven pupil Zakhele Mnisi (18), who was murdered last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six of the 14 murders have taken place in the past two weeks. Police believe they are connected to political violence which began in 1993 between members of the Congress of South African Students (Cosas) and the Pan Africanist Student Organisation (Paso).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But last week's murder victims were not aligned to either organisation, and Cosas says only two of the 14 victims were its members. Paso has no presence in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alina Mnisi, mother of Zakhele Mnisi, said last week he went to the funeral of two school mates also shot dead by the mystery gangs. During the proceedings, &quot;some man grabbed him and Walter (Mokwane), and took them to another funeral of a Paso member&quot; about 5km from the KwaThema graveyard and shot him dead. Police informed her of his death that afternoon, but had made no arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mokwane was shot in the chest and was left for dead. Far East Rand Hospital superintendent Dr Koos Barnard said his condition was satisfactory, but he was &quot;under police guard and nobody is allowed to speak to him&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspector Alex Taueatsoala, who is investigating the case, said Mokwane could be his only witness because other pupils were afraid to come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is funny - the two were abducted in broad daylight, in full view of many people, but apparently now no one has seen anything,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police have no leads on any of the other cases. According to Detective Desmond Watkinson, it's usual for information not to reach the police: &quot;If you knew KwaThema, you'd understand. People are too scared to talk. That is the biggest problem we have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watkinson said the latest murder victim was shot on Tuesday night, but he would give no details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of education for the area, Margaret Webber, said school attendance has declined at the seven KwaThema high schools because of the murders. Full-time police and South African National Defence Force soldiers moved into the area in August. Pupils are searched for weapons when they go to school and police patrol the streets when they walk home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is so abnormal that some days we do not have classes.  Despite the police presence, we haven't had normal schooling since June,&quot; Webber said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week a commission of inquiry appointed by Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale began public hearings into &quot;the violence which has disrupted schooling and education in KwaThema&quot;. People who have testified so far blamed the conflict on Cosas and Paso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the commission's head, advocate Clive van der Spuy, said he had been unable to trace any Paso members in the area: &quot;There doesn't seem to be a formal structure of Paso in KwaThema. It has been a word used to describe those alleged to be responsible (for the murders),&quot; but nobody has named individuals, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosas branch deputy chair Muzikaifani Nhlangothi said the violence was being fanned by conflict between a branch of South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) and a breakaway faction called Tswelopile yaSitshaba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenny Madalane, from a local civic group, told the commission some people in organisations like Sanco were using school children as &quot;foot soldiers&quot; for their political campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission is also investigating allegations of police corruption after accusations were made that some suspects had not been arrested and in other cases suspects were released without any investigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the week that the company which builds Nissans kicked off a major retrenchment programme by sacking 200 workers, it has emerged that the car manufacturer has acquired two luxury retreats in the bushveld for its executives and clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Automakers, which has performed dismally on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange since its listing a year ago, confirmed this week it had one lodge at a game park in Northern Province and another under construction in the exclusive Leopard Creek golfing resort in Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's lay-offs at the company's Rosslyn plant near Pretoria constituted the first phase of a retrenchment programme which will hit 900 employees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's representative, Johan Kleynhans, refused to say how much Automakers had paid for the retreats and how much it pumped into their monthly upkeep. &quot;We are not willing to disclose this to the press or the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the &quot;motor industry, by its very nature, needs customer contact and corporate entertainment of various sorts. It makes economic sense (to have company-owned retreats),&quot; he said, adding that the lodges provided employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kleynhans said he assumed the National Union of Metalworkers (Numsa) had raised the cost of the retreats during its talks with management. Both retreats had been acquired around the time of the listing, but the Leopard Creek lodge was still being built. According to a representative of the South African Tourist Bureau (Satour), only members can obtain publicity material of the top-of-the-range resort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numsa, which has vigorously opposed the retrenchments, said the splurge on the retreats was a prime example of expenditure that was unrelated to the business of making cars. The union's Tony Kgobe, who is heading talks with management, said Numsa also questioned the company's policy of running duplicate offices in Johannesburg and Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kgobe said the company had not discussed with the union how best to cut costs, but had simply told it there had to be cutbacks and asked for help in implementing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that management had refused to discuss executives' salaries and managers' packages, indicating these matters were not the concern of the union. &quot;We are dealing with people who are not open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unlikely the company would stop its retrenchments without some strike action, Kgobe said. The two sides had called in mediators from the Independent Mediation Services of South Africa who would start work next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Automakers's shareprice on the JSE has plummeted since the company's listing in October 1995. It started out at 565c, sank as low as 214c a share last month and yo- yoed between 234c and 250c on Tuesday and Wednesday. One industry analyst suggested this week's price stabilisation stemmed from speculation that Nissan Japan would step in and rescue the South African operation, which also builds Fiat Unos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Automakers's performance has been hit by a number of external factors, including the rand's collapse which has kicked up import costs, and increased competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's profits for the financial year which ended in June were R128- million - way off the R157-million it targeted when it listed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Automakers's chairman, John Newbury, was not available for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Cameron commissioner Laurie Nathan this week joined the chorus of concern over South Africa's decision to sell arms to Rwanda, saying the government had not complied with its own criteria on exports to sensitive areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water Affairs and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal, who heads the Cabinet committee responsible for arms control, countered that it had done careful checks over three months before reaching its decision last week, and that the committee was satisfied South African arms would not fall into the wrong hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nathan, a member of the government-appointed commission which recommended a new arms control policy last year, said: &quot;I accept the request for arms from the Rwandan government poses a dilemma; it is not a clear-cut case ... We are talking about a government that represents a community which was subject to the most severe act of genocide since World War II.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan government, dominated by minority Tutsis, came to power two years ago when the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front ousted the majority Hutu-led government blamed for the genocide of up to a million Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the present government was not popularly elected - and may be unlikely to win elections if its support remains mostly Tutsi-based - it has strong international support after its role in ending the genocide. But it has been accused of committing atrocities in turn. Amnesty International has cited numerous incidents in which government troops have allegedly committed serious human rights abuses, including massacres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan army, also dominated by minority Tutsis, is battling insurgency attempts by Hutu forces now based mostly in neighouring Zaire, while another neighbour, Burundi, is wracked by ethnic bloodletting between the Tutsi-led military government - which seized power in an internationally condemned coup earlier this year - and Hutu guerrillas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asmal's National Conventional Arms Control Committee(NCACC) last year spelt out criteria for deciding on sensitive arms sales, which include respect for human rights, the security situation in the recipient country and surrounding region, the possible escalation of regional conflict, and whether weapons may be diverted or re-exported from the recipient country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nathan said &quot;certain of these criteria had not been complied with&quot;. His greatest concern was that, especially if the consignment included small arms, &quot;the Rwandan armed forces would not be able to ensure it stays in their possession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the second Cameron report last year recommended consultation on arms exports with Parliament's foreign affairs and defence committees, and that arms-control policy be laid down in legislation (neither of which was implemented).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asmal said the NCACC had received assurances from the Rwandan government that it would respect sanctions against the Burundi government. It had been &quot; independently&quot; verified that there was a &quot;fundamental difference&quot; between the &quot;legitimate&quot; Tutsi- led government of Rwanda and its Tutsi counterpart in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most importantly, we established that Rwanda has embarked on a process of reconciliation ... The fundamental reason we gave the permit is that they are entitled to defend themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Athletics South Africa rigging scandal broken by the Mail &amp; Guardian last week was followed up by the rest of the media. Officers of ASA went on radio to defend themselves against the charges. The following are some extracts from the broadcasts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;I haven't read the article from this morning.&quot; - Bernard Rose, chief executive officer of Athletics South Africa (ASA) referring to the Mail &amp; Guardian report accusing the federation of attempting to rig races</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;I just don't understand the purpose of the (Mail &amp; Guardian) article, other than as a personal vendetta against ASA. It staggers me that someone writes this.&quot; - Stewart Banner, chairman of API Sponsorship (Pty) Ltd which manages Sepeng</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;(It is) a discussion, a proposal document. Which is exactly what his (Sepeng's) management asked us to do, put down our thoughts.&quot; - Bernard Rose on the Sepeng contract</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;It is illegal, it is against the law and it is immoral.&quot; - Sydney Maree, former 1 500m world record-holder, on the Sepeng contract</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;(We will) ensure that in future nothing of this sort happens. Even as an idea. We won't even think of ideas like this.&quot; - Banele Sindani, secretary general of ASA on the Sepeng contract </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;Well I don't think really we are now going on a witch-hunt as to who was responsible for it. Every company has got people who are responsible for whatever.&quot; - Banele Sindani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;The manipulation that is implied behind the scenes by this contract is extremely worrying. Because if your top athletes are being potentially exploited and abused and having these kind of pressures put on them one wonders what is going to be happening to the lessor athletes who possibly do not have the bargaining power that a man like Hezekiel Sepeng has. It is of grave concern to anyone who loves athletics.&quot; - Richard Meyer, founder member of Interim Athletes' Liaison Committee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;It's not a contract.&quot; - Bernard Rose</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;It was drawn up, yes, we're not denying that.&quot; - Banele Sindani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;Does ASA, who you represent as secretary general, condemn this sort of thinking; the sort of thinking that says an athlete should run sub-standard times?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, an idea is an idea. An idea is an idea.&quot; - Exchange between radio host Will Bernard and Banele Sindani</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The row over the Sepeng contract is merely the latest in a series of controversies which have dogged Athletics South Africa (ASA), most of them centring on the chief executive officer of the federation, Bernard Rose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former athletes' agent and sales and marketing manager for a sports shoe company was appointed on April 1 1994, on the recommendation of the commission of inquiry into athletics conducted by the then president of ASA, former judge Mervyn King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Rose took the post athletics was in turmoil. The previous interim administration had concentrated more on politics and forgotten about the bills. Rose quickly identified a few trusted lieutenants who understood his kind of language and arranged the so-called &quot;April Fools&quot; elections which ushered in democracy on April 1 last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time he began smartening up the image of athletics and earning some serious money for both the sport and himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rose had negotiated a contract with ASA which allegedly gave him a fixed salary as well as commission on all new business he could bring into the organisation. He has refused to divulge details of his contract, but his commission is believed to be more than 10%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several sponsors parted ways with ASA, with some complaining about Rose's handling of negotiations. New sponsors were swiftly brought in and Rose and the sport began to reap the dividends. But rumours began spreading about Rose's contract, resulting in growing dissatisfaction within the athletics fraternity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the two track medals won at Atlanta represent an improvement on South Africa's performance at the previous Olympics, critics argue that ASA can claim little responsibility. The most tangible results of the much-talked about, but little- implemented development programme for athletics are the two cars now being driven by ASA's president, Leonard Chuene, and secretary general Banele Sindani, the first paid incumbent of ASA's now defunct Development Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An excellent start to coaching development was made by the International Amateur Athletic Federation through a project sponsored by the British government in 1995. But there is still no national coaching structure up and running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also many other problems in the sport, particularly at the provincial level. But in fairness to ASA many of these involve protagonists who have yet to bury their pre- unity differences. ASA's behavior has not helped matters, though, and it is seen to be partisan in its handling of crises like the one in Boland where two rival executives contested their legitimacy in court. A court ruling led to elections last week, the outcome of which ASA is refusing to accept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although many involved with athletics feel strongly about the damage the current administration is doing to the sport, they are unwilling to speak out for fear of victimisation. Their fears can be understood, considering the treatment allegedly handed out to Philip Spies by ASA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spies tested positive for a banned substance last year after receiving clearance from ASA's doping control officer to use the offending substance - a multi-vitamin supplement. At a meeting with Rose and Sindani on November 15 last year, at which Spies was hauled over the coals for having challenged ASA on his suspension, he was reportedly told in no uncertain terms what would happen to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The meeting ended with Bernard Rose saying he would fuck up my life and my athletics career if I ever fucked with them again,&quot; recalls Spies. The athlete continued his efforts to clear his name and paid the price. He was left out of the Olympic team despite having the second highest number of qualifying marks in South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The scandal over the &quot;rigging&quot; of races by Athletics South Africa (ASA) escalated this week with allegations that the country's athletics chief, Bernard Rose, attempted to destroy evidence supporting the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest development in the controversy came as the Mail &amp; Guardian obtained a copy of a second &quot;rigging&quot; contract drawn up by ASA - this time signed by Rose, as chief executive officer of the federation, in front of witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rose allegedly attempted to have the second contract destroyed before it reached the M&amp;G and replace it with a &quot;clean&quot; version.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week this newspaper startled the sports world by disclosing that ASA had tried to get the Olympic silver medalist, Hezekiel Sepeng, to sign a contract which included, among other things, an undertaking that he would not attempt to break the South African record except at meetings sponsored by Engen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rose and other athletics officials denied there was such a contract - insisting it was a &quot;discussion document&quot; and offering as &quot;proof&quot; of this the fact that it was not signed. The M&amp;G was accused, by supporters of Rose, of conducting a vendetta against ASA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second contract obtained by the M&amp;G was between ASA and Sepeng's chief 800m rival in South Africa, Marius van Heerden. It is almost identical to the Sepeng document - including a clause requiring Van Heerden not to attack the South African record except at specified meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Van Heerden contract also includes a handwritten amendment - seemingly in Rose's handwriting - specifying that &quot;ASA hereby undertakes to sign similar agreements with Hezekiel Sepeng and Johan Botha&quot;, the third South African 800m runner who took part in the Atlanta Olympics. The amendment added: &quot;Should Sepeng and Botha not sign with ASA, then this agreement will be terminated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contract was signed in Cape Town on April 20 1996 by Van Heerden, Rose, a Chris Botes - who is described in the document as &quot;meeting director&quot; - and an unidentified witness. They have also countersigned the amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document was given to the M&amp;G this week by Van Heerden's coach, Tommy Tesnar, who said he was determined the truth should come out &quot;for the good of the sport&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tesnar said he had received two calls this week from Rose, urging him to destroy his copy of the original Van Heerden contract and promising to send a new version.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tesnar said a revised contract - excluding the contentious clauses in the original - was faxed to him by Rose on Wednesday this week. The imprint on the top of the fax gave the date as April 22. Tesnar receives his faxes via the offices of a Stellenbosch company which keeps an independent record of the date when documents are received on their machine. This record confirms that Rose faxed the contract this week and not in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bernard Rose told me today (Wednesday) that there are only two (of the original) contracts in existence, his and mine, and if it comes out in the press he will know where it has come from,&quot; said Tesnar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalling the circumstances in which the original contract was signed, Tesnar said he and Van Heerden were approached by ASA one week after Van Heerden had smashed the 25- year-old South African 800m record, on the first day of the SA Championships in Cape Town. &quot;It was a Friday afternoon about 14: 00 hours and they gave a copy of the contract to myself and Marius and explained it to us. They said they wanted it signed before we went home that evening, but I said I wanted to take it home and think about it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was that night that I wrote the extra clause I wanted put in the contract (requiring the joint agreement of Sepeng and Botha). The next day we went to see them and there was myself, Marius, Chris Botes, Bernard Rose and Riaan Esterhuizen (manager of the Bellville Athletics Club to which Van Heerden belongs) present. They asked me what I thought about it and I told them and Bernard said no problem and took out his pen and wrote it (the amendment) on our contract and we all signed it. I thought it was a bit strange, but I told Marius let's sign it and see what happens,&quot; recalled Tesnar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterwards Tesnar began to worry whether he had done the right thing and consulted others in the athletic fraternity in Stellenbosch, where he lives. &quot; Everybody said it was ridiculous and ASA couldn't do that,&quot; said Tesnar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Maties club were particularly upset because they realised the contract would rule out top class 800m races at their meetings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Something is rotten in the state of soccer. Claims of drug dealing, poison plots, bribery and corruption make for a rough-and- tumble in which the ultimate loser is the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the last four months the Pickard Commission, appointed by Sports Minister Steve Tshwete to investigate allegations of corruption in the National Soccer League (NSL) and the South African Football Association (Safa) , has been the scene of a slanging match between the supremos of the sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But outside the commission's chambers in Sandton runs a parallel fixture in which the long knives are flashing in the glare of the media spotlight.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week the Premier Soccer League, an affiliate of the NSL, reacted angrily to claims by Kaizer Motaung, MD of Kaizer Chiefs, that he had boycotted the league's launch a month ago because he had been tipped off he would be poisoned at the function. The league denied the poison allegation, but asked Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bizarre as the tip-off had been, Motaung chose to heed it, saying: &quot;There is so much acrimony in football that you cannot trust anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest feuding appears to stem from animosity between Safa, the controlling body of football in South Africa, and NSL, the Safa affiliate which represents the professional clubs. Behind the scenes, the battle lines are drawn further between powerful interest groups like the &quot;A-team&quot;, allegedly a caucus of soccer supremos, top businessmen and politicians who &quot; manipulate&quot; Safa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the mid-1980s, soccer in South Africa has gone through a series of structural changes aimed at breaking down racial barriers and streamlining administration. The United Democratic Front and later the African National Congress played a significant role in bringing the factions together, culminating in the 1991 creation of Safa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the new structures brought with them a vying for control - and competition over the lucrative spoils of the game - which now threatens to undo whatever was left of the facade of unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said a member of the sports fraternity who played a leading role in the unity negotiations: &quot;It was big bucks from day one, and that culture stayed ..  . It has done nothing to improve the lot of black soccer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groupings include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safa is led by Solomon &quot;Stix&quot; Morewa, its executive president. Morewa met ANC leaders in exile in 1986 or 1987, where he was identified as the organisation's choice to be future supremo of the sport in South Africa. The idea, a knowledgeable party said, was to &quot;get soccer behind the ANC&quot;, while encouraging the sport to integrate so that the sports boycott could be lifted on multi-racial soccer. The ANC also made approaches to Motaung at the time, but he &quot;backed off&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Morewa is nominally in charge of Safa, his image has been seriously dented by evidence before the Pickard Commission that the Safa Education Trust, created to help deserving people involved in soccer advance their education, had paid money to soccer bosses and their children. Evidence was that &quot;an S Morewa, or possibly S Molewa&quot;, had also received R3 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have also been allegations before the commission that the &quot;A-team&quot;, or members of it, have been acting as the real power behind the throne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NSL: Two of its leading lights are Irvin Khoza, the Orlando Pirates chief, and Jomo Sono, boss of Jomo Cosmos football club. NSL members appear to believe that Safa is trying to wrest more powers from it, and also feel that not all benefits due to the clubs - such as a stake in some large sponsorships - are handed down by Safa. Sono encapsulated the feeling in a newspaper column: &quot;There is concern among the professionals that the Safa leadership might not always be able to represent their interests as well as the professionals want them to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was the case of our rights being sold to a private company (apparent reference to Awesome Sports International, an offshore company) for a mere R700 000. We gave them the professional players in order to raise monies and they in turn gave it to the company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Motaung, a close ally of Morewa's, told the commission his club, Kaizer Chiefs, was &quot;clean&quot; and that &quot;we do not run our team with drug money&quot;, it drew counter-fire from Sono and his NSL ally Khoza. Sono told the Mail &amp; Guardian that Motaung should give facts and refrain from &quot;making allegations he could not verify&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, indeed, drugs allegations in the upper echelons of soccer have been one of the sport's greatest blemishes in the public perception. Khoza has been at the centre of a row over the disappearance and presumed murder of Soweto socialite Rocks Dhlamini in April last year after a deal with alleged drug baron Vicky Goswami - who has since left the country - went wrong. Khoza has acknowledged being an intermediary in a money transaction related to the deal, but denied knowledge of it being related to drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Chris Meela, who gave police information on Dhlamini's disappearance, died mysteriously in August after disappearing from hospital, while Sylvester Mofokeng, a convict linked to Dhlamini's disappearance in press reports, was critically wounded by police when he &quot;escaped&quot; from prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Awesome Sports International (ASI): An offshore company appointed as its marketing arm by Safa. Allegations have been that Safa policies have been dictated by the close relationship between Safa officials and ASI. Said Judge Pickard during one of the commission sittings: &quot;There are ... private interests which dictate Safa's policies and the reason for this is the suggestion that ASI and Safa executives are partners who serve together but on what basis they serve, I don't really know at this stage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Pickard had his wings clipped last month when ASI went to court to contest warrants issued by the commission to obtain ASI documentation. After legal advice that the warrants were &quot;probably unconstitutional&quot;, the commission withdrew them, meaning it may not be able to find out whether Safa officials benefited personally from ASI contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;A-team&quot;, whose power some say is on the wane, has been accused at the commission of acting like a Mafia-grouping manipulating soccer from behind the scenes. Motaung, Morewa and other leading soccer luminaries - as well as prominent businessmen and politicians - are alleged to be among its membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NSL executive member Veli Mahlangu said the body was a formal structure whose members had to pay a fee to remain part of the select elite. He said it included politicians - whom he refused to name - and that the body &quot;wanted to control soccer and members wanted to recruit politicians whom they believed would give the group a powerful influence&quot;. He said Khoza was part of the group, but left after becoming disillusioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been allegations that ASI director Brian Mahon was also a member, but Motaung denied before the commission that this was the case. Mahon has so far declined to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission sits next on October 8.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Did the man who killed a reveller at a party thrown by soccer celebrity Doctor Khumalo really study criminology, sociology, psychology and Zulu at the University of Zululand?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the question that vexed lawyers this week as they debated the sentence to be imposed on Sipho Tshabalala who rocked the cream of society at that fatal party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshabalala was found guilty in June of murdering Grant Moabi, after a brawl about soccer teams and a bottle of brandy, in a trial that has encapsulated the banality of murder South African-style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshabalala has been allowed to carry his gun while on bail after being convicted of murder. The debonair 27-year-old has treated the packed courtroom to a dazzling fashion display which culminated this week in his appearance in a flowing blue and gold robe, matching slippers and designer sunglasses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the trial began at the Rand Supreme Court in May, Judge Lucy Mailula heard how Tshabalala had arrived at the party fresh from the Rugby World Cup final at Ellis Park last year, his face painted with the South African flag.  During the evening he had argued with Moabi and Bobby Motaung - son of Kaizer Chiefs boss Kaizer Motaung - about the relative merits of rival soccer teams Jomo Cosmos and Kaizer Chiefs. A few hours later there had been a squabble about a bottle of brandy, at which Tshabalala had pulled out his pistol and shot Moabi dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Mailula rejected Tshabalala's account of the fatal party. The accused claimed Moabi had produced a gun first, prompting him to fire a pre-emptive shot in self- defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge favoured the version of events told by Bobby Motaung who insisted Moabi had not carried a gun to the party. Judge Mailula said she was not convinced Tshabalala had been that drunk at the party as he had been able to navigate his car shortly afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week she and her two assessors heard additional evidence which could have affected sentence. Tshabalala told them that while studying he designed commemorative coins for the South African Mint. The Department of Correctional Services, which said he was a student at the University of Zululand, told them Tshabalala was a suitable candidate for a sentence of correctional supervision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor, Mongeza Nqoro, called Lindi Moabi, the deceased's widow, to the stand. Moabi, a marketing manager at Syfrets, described how she supported several dependants and a two-year-old child who suffered from cerebral palsy.  After Nqoro had finished his cross-examination, Judge Mailula intervened to ask Moabi the crucial question: how had the murder affected her? Moabi replied the trauma associated with her husband's death had caused her to miscarry a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshabalala's counsel Mannie Witz argued for a sentence of correctional supervision. &quot;It is clear that one life has already been lost. It is now up to your Ladyship to see another life is not wasted.&quot; He said Tshabalala had, up until the shooting, led a blameless life but had lost his cool in the heady atmosphere following the Rugby World Cup. &quot;This was not cold-blooded murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited a batch of cases in which murderers had been given a sentence of correctional supervision, including one in which a drunk policeman had shot a civilian in the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nqoro retaliated with a list of cases in which correctional supervision had been rejected as an appropriate sentence. Witz said most of these were irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the precedents Nqoro cited involved fraud. Perhaps the most startling case he read out quietly to Judge Mailula was that of the Appellate Division decision in State v Kensley, an extraordinary murder case in which the accused shot two tranvestites who had enticed him down to a Cape Town beach with the promise of sex. When he discovered they were men he killed them and injured two others who had accompanied him to the beach. The Appeal Court rejected his request for a sentence of correctional supervision, upholding the trial judge's four-year prison sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nqoro said the state wanted a prison sentence for Tshabalala. To Judge Mailula's question &quot;short or long&quot;, he replied &quot;15 years&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final lap of the case was devoted to a bizarre pursuit of proof that Tshabalala in fact attended classes at the University of Zululand - evidence which could have swayed the judge 's decision on sentence. Although Tshabalala produced a flattering letter of commendation from the university's vice- chancellor, the prosecution insisted on more proof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nqoro, who insisted Tshabalala did not attend his classes or take exams, grilled Tshabalala about the various lecturers at the university and the whereabouts of their offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several delays due to Nqoro's vigorous efforts to prove Tshabalala did not attend, he finally conceded the accused was a student at the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of going to press Judge Mailula had yet to pass sentence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Bantu Holomisa, while preparing to launch a court action against the African National Congress to overturn his expulsion from the organisation, will be addressing rallies around the country in coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa was locked in consultations with his lawyers this week after instructing them to seek a legal review of expulsion from the ANC.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under consideration was launching an urgent interdict to prevent his losing his seat in Parliament, as no constitutional mechanism exists for reinstatement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa's expulsion from the ANC, decided at a disciplinary meeting on August 30, was confirmed by unanimous decision at a special meeting of the ANC's 77-member national executive committee on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa said the judgment he was handed this week bore little resemblance to the one he had received after the disciplinary hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe this judgment was written with a political solution in mind to recover lost ground and repair some of the damage done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ANC was castigated locally and internationally for acting against me for going to the truth commission. That triggered a series of events which gave rise to the additional charges. I look forward to going to court, where there will be a neutral hearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa will be addressing rallies in KwaMahlanga, Mpumulanga on Saturday, in Khayelitsha and Guguletu on Sunday, in Soweto next Sunday, and in Rustenburg the following Saturday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Minister of Broadcasting and Communications Jay Naidoo is considering rushing through an amendment to the Broadcasting Act to allow the government to keep some or all of the money raised from the sale of the SABC's commercial radio stations, according to sources in the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC is hoping to raise more than R500- million from the sale of the radio stations, and is hoping to keep the money, which it needs to fill its emptying coffers. Legally the SABC, not the government, is entitled to the returns from the radio stations. But, according to sources, the government wants to change the law so it can have an option to take a lion's share.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naidoo is tight-lipped on the matter, saying only that such an amendment is not an issue under discussion at the moment. His representative, Connie Malusi, said the ministry would get around the problem of the Broadcasting Act if the need arose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naidoo this week was engaged in negotiations with the SABC on how the public broadcaster ought to be funded, and what government support would be provided in future. &quot;Detailed budget proposals are being prepared by SABC that will deal with the overall funding of the national public broadcaster.  There is no acrimony in these disussions. I am convinced we will come to a satisfactory conclusion on funding,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC has stated it needs not only the proceeds of the sale, but also extra government funding annually to continue fulfilling its mandate as a public broadcaster, broadcasting in 11 languages. But there is concern within the corporation that future government money may come with strings attached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naidoo's stance on the independence of the SABC is ambiguous. He denies the government will insist on &quot;strings&quot;, but says applications for funds must be properly motivated and the SABC will have to compete with other government institutions, such as the departments of health and education, for funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are constraints on funds, and applications must be properly motivated. The government has never attached any strings beyond financial accountability to Parliament. No one is above the sovereignty of Parliament,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC representative Enoch Sithole said this week he had heard of a possible amendment to the Broadcasting Act. He expected it to provoke a public row.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would hate to say the SABC would fight this one itself,&quot; he said. &quot;We are here on behalf of the public, and it's up to them to make this an issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party spokesman on broadcasting, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, said his party would support the amendment because the government should get the money from the radio stations, in line with the principles of privatisation.  The NP has proposed a parliamentary debate on the state of the SABC's finances for the next parliamentary session.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Attempts by political parties and public groups to bring new issues into the Constitution-amending process, or to stretch old ones out, is partly responsible for holding up agreement on matters referred back to the Constitutional Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday morning, the Constitution-makers were still in the woods, and were unable to report breakthroughs on most of the amendments they need to make before next week to satisfy the Constitutional Court's demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early deadlines came and went this week, with parties spending most of the time behind closed doors, engaged in a complicated web of bilateral and multilateral meetings. Constitutional Assembly chairman Cyril Ramaphosa said with a frown after a report-back on Thursday morning: &quot;It does not look very encouraging. Actually, it looks quite gloomy. It seems as if we are tying ourselves into knots unable to grasp the nettle and find agreement.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although Ramaphosa's mood improved as the optimists among the Constitution-makers attempted to paint a brighter picture, it became clear negotiations would stretch right to the very last minute. A meeting of the Constitutional Committee has been scheduled for Monday, when all issues must be resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outstanding matters are being dealt with by two subcommittees. One has been able to finalise only one of the issues it is grappling with - the text on states of emergency - and is still battling to find resolution on the Labour Relations clause, the Truth and Reconciliation clause, collective bargaining, the independence of the Public Service Commission, and the appointment and removal of the public protector and auditor general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second subcommittee, chaired by African National Congress MP Pravin Gordhan, seemed to make more progress, particularly in refining the local government chapter, although arguments persisted through Wednesday night on municipal taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, in the style of the Kempton Park negotiations,the parties were sunk deep in bilateral meetings on the thorny matter of provincial powers. The National Party's request to bring policing powers back under provincial jurisdiction were a particular sticking point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Inkatha Freedom Party's demands include that the monarchy of Kwazulu- Natal be entrenched in the Constitution, and that greater authority be given to traditional leaders in local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFP's re-entry into the process has been puzzling. At the beginning of the week the IFP sent only two delegates to the negotiations and tabled incomplete proposals - key words and phrases had been left out - creating the impression that the party members were there half-heartedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, IFP MP Peter Smith said: &quot;We are very serious about what we are doing here. Our return is not motivated by the chance of reopening new issues, but there are some issues where there is an automatic necessity to go beyond the Constitutional Court judgment, and we need some fluidity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFP is trying to stretch out the opportunity as much as it can without finally snapping the patience of an extremely tense ANC.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The United Nations World Food Programme this week began distributing packages of bean seed and food to nearly 75,000 vulnerable farming families in Rwanda. WFP is providing more than US$ 1 million of food aid and 50 tons of high altitude bean seed to help farmers increase their yields over the coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hunger often drives farmers to the point where they eat their scarce seed stocks,&quot; says Zlatan Milisic, WFP's Information Officer in Rwanda. &quot;For this reason, food and seeds are being distributed simultaneously. Also traditionally, more food is consumed during the planting season -- a time of heavy physical labor.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme will benefit families primarily in the prefectures of Butare, Gikongoro and Kibuye, and the areas of Bugesera and Nasho, all of which are considered to be &quot;high risk&quot; areas for crop failure and food shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each family will receive eight kilograms of seeds along with a 40 kilo package of rice, beans and vegetable oil. This is enough food to sustain a family of five during the main month of the planting season. The family's food package is worth approximately US$ 28 in Rwanda. The World Bank puts Rwanda's average annual per capita income at US$ 80.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a recent assessment by WFP, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the European Union (EU), some 576,000 Rwandans still require food aid support. While Rwanda's war-wracked agricultural sector has been steadily recovering over the last two years, crop production remains 23 per cent below pre-war levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP is currently providing food to 350,000 Rwandans in more than 400 activities countrywide. More than 65 per cent of WFP's assistance in Rwanda is provided through food-for work programmes. In these programmes, community members receive WFP food packages as compensation for their work on local rehabilitation projects that help improve agriculture, clean fisheries, build houses, develop water catchments, repair roads, and other infrastructure rebuilding activities.  WFP's seed protection packages are part of a joint programme supported by the EU and FAO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">***</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations World Food Programme is the largest international food aid organization in the world. Last year,WFP fed more than 50 million people, including half of the world's refugees and internally displaced people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman of the arts council, Mumba Kapumpa said that artists have a role to play in the development of the country and therefore should not be left out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking at the launching of the national arts council at Lusaka Play House today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A consignment of medical equipment and materials was flown into eastern Zaire today (Sunday) as part of a stepped-up emergency operation by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to assist thousands of people suffering because of conflict in the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

The supplies were provided by the German Red Cross, which is sending a five-member surgical team to reinforce the casualty unit at Uvira hospital, while the Belgian Red Cross is to support the hospital's public helath activities. The new assistance comes in addition to existing ICRC support for hospitals and health centres in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile a survey in north Kivu has revealed that many medical centres have been abandoned, looted or damaged during the ethnic conflict in the area.  Under the new ICRC initiative six hospitals and 30 health centres will receive support. ICRC water and sanitation teams are to carry out emergency work to restore supplies in villages where water distribution systems have been destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 2 October the ICRC launches an urgent appeal to governments for more than 11 million US dollars to finance the expanded aid operation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Following is the text of an October 2 letter from Peter Takirambudde Executive Director Human Rights Watch/Africa to Secretary of State Warren Christopher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch/Africa welcomes your forthcoming visit to sub-Saharan Africa. The human rights situation on the African continent demands the sustained attention of the U.S. government, and we hope that your visit will underscore the importance that this administration attaches to respect for human rights in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to ensure that the human rights issues will figure prominently on your agenda, we would like to make the following suggestions about issues that could usefully be raised during your visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Arusha, Tanzania, we understand that you will be meeting with representatives of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. It is crucial that the U.S. remain a strong, public supporter of the tribunal, both financially and politically. Your visit could also remind the international community, including the regional states, of the importance of cooperating with the tribunal. The recent actions taken by the Kenyan authorities in arresting Obed Ruzindana provide a positive example of such cooperation, as had the cooperation of Cameroon and Zambia; unfortunately, not all states have been committed to such cooperation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, your visit provides an opportunity to address issues of concern about the tribunal, including the inefficient functioning of the registrar's office, the need to fully respect the rights of the defense, and the lack of an effective mechanism to provide protection for victims and witnesses. In all these areas, the tribunal's performance has been unsatisfactory.  Regarding the victim and witness protection unit, no effective measures have been taken to protect victims and witnesses from current or potential reprisals. We are particularly concerned about protection issues in light of recent reports that the home of one of the tribunal's witnesses was burned down in Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since you may be meeting with leaders of the Rwandan government, we strongly urge you to raise U.S. concerns about the continued paralysis of the Rwandan judicial system. More than two years have passed since the end of the genocide, and both the civilian and the military justice systems remain blocked. As a result, more than 80,000 prisoners are being held in inhumane conditions in grossly overcrowded prisons, and new arrests continue every week. Although the Rwandan government has often cited the lack of legislation to prosecute genocide cases and crimes against humanity as the reason for the blockage, that legislation has now been passed by the Transitional National Assembly and approved by the Constitutional Court. In addition, judicial personnel have been trained, significant resources have been put into the judicial system, and many cases are ready for prosecution. It is therefore critical that the U.S. insist on trials going forward, while also stressing that provisions be made for the defense of the accused. Meanwhile, judicial personnel who have tried to move forward with prosecutions have themselves been the victims of attacks and intimidation. In these circumstances, there is no justice for either the victims or the alleged perpetrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to deal with the armed infiltrators attacking Rwanda from refugee camps in Zaire, the Rwandan government has launched a series of &quot;search and cordon&quot; operations, which have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of unarmed civilians. These are not unfortunate collateral killings, as the government has tried to portray them, but rather deliberate executions. Both our investigation and that of the U.N. Human Rights Field Operation have documented these killings. It would be very important if you would call upon the Rwandan government to deliver clear orders to its military to respect international human rights and humanitarian law in treatment of civilians, and to discipline and punish those responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In discussions with regional leaders about the situation in Burundi, we urge you to raise the issue of impunity for gross human rights violations.  The U.S. should be careful not to reward Major Buyoya for taking power in the name of restoring order, without acknowledging that the very group that installed him -- the army -- has been one of the chief causes of insecurity for the people of Burundi. Certainly the failure to bring those responsible for past slaughter to justice encourages extremists on both sides to continue using massive killings of civilians to gain or retain political power. The regional leaders should be encouraged to make Buyoya's willingness to hold abusive military officials accountable for their crimes in military courts as a test of his government's commitment to democracy and rule of law. Buyoya should also be pressured to work with the civilian judicial system in order to make it possible for that system to implement accountability in the civilian domain as well, possibly with the assistance of expatriate advisors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, since in the short term the civilian Burundian judiciary may be too fearful of reprisals to act independently, it is highly unlikely that domestic courts would conduct fair trails for those individuals on both sides who have been responsible for gross human rights abuses. Accordingly, we have called for the creation of an ad hoc tribunal to prosecute those charged with genocide and crimes against humanity. To maximize its deterrent effect, jurisdiction should include future such violations committed in the course of the current crisis. Because the continuing conflict in Burundi results in large part from mutual fear between the majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi, prosecutions are especially important as a way to eradicate impunity and end the cycles of violence that have plagued Burundi for so many years. Only by the establishment of the rule of law can people on both sides look to the state as a credible guarantor of the lives of all citizens. To demonstrate that the Convention for the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide as well as the customary international law concerning crimes against humanity have meaning, we urge you to support our call for the creation of a tribunal to prosecute those charged with these massive violations in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also hope that your discussions with the states participating in the economic sanctions against Burundi will underscore the need for the regional states to exempt humanitarian assistance from the sanctions. Economic sanctions should not be applied in a manner that substantially risks denying Burundi's civilian population of foodstuffs, medicines and other humanitarian supplies that are vital to its subsistence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ethiopia, we believe that the U.S. should use its considerable influence to foster genuine progress towards the full respect of human rights. While considerable progress was made since the fall of the Derg, problem areas remain as the rights to freedom from political killings, arbitrary detention and torture are widely violated within the context of civil strife, particularly in Oromia, Somali and Afar regions. Peasant militia commanded by political cadres from the ruling coalition and by local officials were reliably reported to be behind most of the violations. They do not seem to be held accountable for their conduct in detaining without charges hundreds of persons suspected of supporting insurgent groups. We have documented several recent cases of torture and disappearances in which security detainees and members of their families were the victims. The Ethiopian government also cracks down routinely on dissenting voices within the private press, trade unions, nongovernmental organizations with a civic education and human rights monitoring mandate, and opposition parties, severely limiting the political space available to these groups and restricting the rights to freedom of opinion, expression and association that the constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia guarantees. By raising these issues with the Ethiopian authorities, your visit could help create a climate more conducive to respect for human rights in Ethiopia.  During your meeting with President Mandela in South Africa, we hope that you will raise the issue of Nigeria. In November 1995, South Africa led the call for strong action against Nigeria, and President Mandela spoke to both Prime Minister John Major and President Clinton to urge multilateral action. Since then, South Africa has become less outspoken. Some South African diplomats have acknowledged that they cannot act against Nigeria without other African support. Your visit would provide an opportunity to raise Nigeria again with President Mandela, and to encourage him to take the lead among African states in pressing the Nigerian government to respect human rights and return the country rapidly to civilian rule. At the same time, the U.S. government should play its part by assisting the South Africans in building a coalition of countries that are willing to work together to ensure respect for human rights and a return to civilian rule in Nigeria. In order to have credibility with the South Africans, the U.S. should itself take actions to push for human rights improvements in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We would be happy to provide you with any additional information that you might request. In the meantime, thank you for your attention to these important matters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - United States secretary of state Warren Christopher began Monday a week-long visit to Africa, including Ethiopia and the headquarters of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher is expected to outline United States policy towards Africa well into the 21st century, with its support for the OAU peace efforts in the continent top on the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is due in Addis Ababa Wednesday from Bamako, Mali, on the second-leg of a five-nation African tour which will also take him to Tanzania, Angola and South Africa. He returns to Washington D.C. Oct. 15.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in Addis Ababa, Christopher will have wide-ranging talks with OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His tour, the first by a top ranking U.S. official of his stature, comes in the wake of the recent proposal by President Bill Clinton for the creation of an all-African crisis response force that is expected to operate under the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enhancing peace and conflict management in Africa are expected to dominate Christopher's talks with Salim, according to diplomatic sources in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are the concern of both the OAU and its friends outside the continent,&quot; said an African diplomat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher will also deliver a public speech Thursday at the OAU on &quot;The OAU and peace in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomats here consider his visit to the OAU as a recognition of the efforts the organization has been making towards peace in the continent, long racked by civil wars and fratricidal conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These efforts have attracted closer scrutiny in Washington and in numerous European capitals, as well as encouragement and support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visit, therefore, says a lot of what had been accomplished in the span of only three years since the OAU mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution formally came into being in 1993 at the Cairo summit of the OAU, according to another African diplomat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher's talks in Addis Ababa would determine Africa's response to Clinton's proposal, which is said to be aimed at strengthening OAU peace efforts. It envisages organizing, training, equipping and deploying an African force of 10,000 troops. Its expenses are to be borne jointly by the U.  S. and the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The force is said to have been conceived as a humanitarian force, as opposed to a fighting one, with the purpose of &quot;establishing and manning&quot; safe areas in conflict zones, to protect persons from all danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would ensure that those in danger get humanitarian assistance unhindered by the ensuing conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton administration has provided more than two million U.S. dollars for the construction and equipping of the OAU conflict management center and its early warning system.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya - The United States senate will soon discuss a bill which calls for affirmative action on African trade and the removal of the quota rule imposed on Kenya textiles, Kenya's Finance Minister, Musalia Mudavadi, has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The proposed bill was drafted by three U.S. senators, who want the U.S.  congress to lift the quota rule imposed on textiles imported from Kenya and Mauritius,&quot; said Mudavadi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was addressing journalists at the Jomo Kenyatta international airport, Nairobi, Sunday evening on arrival from a World Bank/IMF meeting in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed bill, Mudavadi said, was aimed at reducing trade imbalances between Kenya and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes in the wake of a report that more than 10,000 Kenyan textile workers had lost jobs following cuts in the quota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a meeting in the U.S., Mudavadi said the quota on woven shirts and pillow cases had resulted in the closure of several factories in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was gratifying that the U.S. was now trying to make Kenya an equal trading partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It did not make sense to subject Kenyan goods to a quota system when the entire globe is fostering liberalized trade,&quot; said the minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mudavadi also announced that the World Bank and the IMF had come up with a new initiative aimed at allowing development countries to negotiate for debt relief at multi-lateral level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Previously, countries could only negotiate at bilateral level but the resolution means that they can now directly negotiate with the World Bank, the IMF and other such institutions for the reduction of their burden,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe charged Monday that the government was crowding out the private sector from domestic credit sources, saying this was limiting the ability of local companies to invest and create much-needed employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank, in a harsh comment on what it termed state profligacy, said the projected government borrowing from local sources of some 500 million U.S.  dollars was too high to sustain economic growth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank also warned that efforts to cut inflation, which in August fell to a three-year low of 18 percent, would be frustrated by excessive growth in money supply as government continues to rely more on borrowed funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government's 3-billion-dollar budget released July 25 showed a fiscal deficit of 682 million dollars, excluding grants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank said the fact that at least 527 million dollars of the total deficit of 562 million dollars would be come from domestic sources was evidence enough that the government was crowding out the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The public sector, therefore, continues to account for a disproportionate share of domestic financial resources. This, at the expense of productive sector borrowing, will limit the capacity of the private sector to generate much-needed employment and economic growth,&quot; the bank said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, it said that the envisaged recourse to domestic financing of at least 500 million dollars threatened expansion of the money supply, which would dampen the anticipated slowdown of inflationary pressures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank had forecast inflation to fall to 20 percent by December but indications are that it could reach 23 percent following a spate of administered price increases in the past two months, among them fuel, rail and energy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda - Striking Ugandan traders have reopened their businesses despite vows by President Yoweri Museveni that the Value Added Tax, or VAT, regime would be maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Museveni, in his nationwide address on state radio and television Saturday, said the controversial tax was necessary because it would turn Uganda into an export orientated economy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traders want VAT scrapped or reduced to at least 17 percent. When government refused, the traders shut their shops at the end of September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the strike has not been officially called off, businesses reopened in major shopping centers in the capital, Kampala on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many traders said there was no point insisting on the strike when there was no hope of government scrapping VAT, which has replaced the Commercial Transaction Levy and Sales Tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, striking leaders held a closed door meeting Sunday in Kampala to adopt new positions with which to confront the government over the controversial tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, called by the Uganda Importers, Exporters and Traders Association, was convened to react to Museveni's address. At the end of the meeting, the association's treasurer, Godfrey Mugalu, said they would try to meet with Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his address, Museveni blamed officials of the Uganda Revenue Authority for corruption and incompetence which generated controversy over VAT. He also attacked what he said were &quot;opportunistic politicians&quot; for hijacking the traders' strike to further their own interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve people, including a member of parliament, Ken Lukyamuzi, were arrested last week for inciting the public against paying VAT. But they have been released on a presidential prerogative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multilateral institutions consider the Uganda liberal economy to be among the most buoyant on the continent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is the transcript of an October 3 U.S.  Information Agency Worldnet &quot;Dialogue&quot; with George Moose, assistant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">secretary of state for African affairs on Secretary of State Warren Christopher's October 7-15 trip to Africa,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Hello, welcome to Worldnet's &quot;Dialogue,&quot; I'm Jim Harriott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From October the 7th through the 15th, the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher plans to make a five-nation trip to Africa. During this trip the secretary intends to underscore the United States' firm commitment to help further democracy, economic development and trade, regional integration and conflict resolution on the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today we are pleased to have Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs George Moose, joining us live from the U.S. Department of State, to answer questions regarding Secretary Christopher's trip. Welcome, Ambassador Moose.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Ambassador Moose. Thank you very much, Jim. It's good to be here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Any opening thoughts for us?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Well, Jim, let me just say by way of introduction you mentioned that the secretary is about to depart this weekend on a trip to five African nations, and I am delighted to be accompanying him. And the purpose of that trip is to, broadly speaking, to reinforce the efforts that the administration has been making to support African initiatives in the area of democratic transition, economic development, sustainable development, and conflict prevention and conflict resolution. He is going to be using his stops both to highlight the tremendous progress that is being made across the continent, but also to contribute to our ongoing efforts to deal with crisis situations, whether they be in Liberia or in Burundi or in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We very much look forward to the opportunity to hear from our partners in Africa as to how, looking to the future, the United States can continue to assist them in building the capacity to deal with their problems on the continent, in partnership with the United States and with others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we very much look forward to the trip, and look forward to the opportunity today to get a preview of some of the issues that are likely to be raised on the secretary's various stops. Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. Having said that, I would also like to welcome our overseas panel that is in South Africa, Tanzania, and Mali and Angola -- all countries Secretary Christopher will visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will start our discussion today in Addis Ababa. Welcome to Worldnet, and please go ahead in Ethiopia with your questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Mr. Ambassador, we are trying to establish our communications with Addis Ababa. But in the meantime, a question for you. The timing of this particular trip -- I am sure there are those who will question it and whether it has anything to do with the U.S. presidential election campaign. Let's take that one first off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: This is a trip for which, frankly, Secretary Christopher has been hoping and wanting to make for some time. And he has held tenaciously to his commitment to making this trip notwithstanding the exigencies of other events taking place in the world. It is in no way related to our own elections here in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has over the last four years been one of our staunchest supporters, in our efforts with the Congress and with others, to make sure that the United States has the wherewithal, the resources, to honor our obligations and our commitments to the international community broadly speaking, but specifically to Africa. I think he sees this as a way just to underscore his own personal commitment as well as that of the administration to our continued engagement in Africa. And, as I indicated earlier, to highlight the untold story, the unwritten story, about the substantial, tremendous progress and advances that are being made across the continent. That is the fundamental inspiration -- motivation -- for this trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: All right, thank you. Now let's establish with Mali, if we can. Go ahead in Bamako with your questions for the ambassador.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: I am... deputy general director of the political section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As you know, Madam Regina Brown, deputy assistant secretary for African affairs, on August 2, 1996, said that there was a need for an integral approach by the United States in order for African problems to be tackled. And you, Mr. Moose, you said, on September 11, in a letter called &quot;Democracy and U.S. Foreign Policy Towards Africa&quot; -- you said that democracy and development are inseparable and interdependent, and that U.S.  aid -- and the U.S. administration would try to find the resources necessary to support democracy and development in Africa. In the light of these two statements, how do you envisage this participation of the United States in our development and democratization, especially since you said that U.S.  assistance has been cut by 25 percent to Africa on the one hand, and on the other hand, you also said that USAID assistance would also be cut back? Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Well, thank you for your question. It's an indication that one should be careful what one said, because one's words can come back to haunt one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We did indeed say, first and foremost, that there has to be an integral approach to Africa's problems -- and that's not any different from our approach to other parts of the world as well. We know that there must be simultaneous efforts with respect to different aspects of the African agenda.  We know that it is important -- it is critically important to build the institutional underpinnings of democracy in order to sustain the more longer- term effort toward rational responsible use of resources in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also know the importance of dealing with conflict situations and potential conflict situations which if not dealt with threaten to overwhelm the substantial progress that is already being made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we also know that you cannot sustain democracy or peace without a substantial improvement in the welfare, the livelihood, of individuals and people across the continent. And that is why (a) continuing partnership, in terms of a foreign assistance, but also increasingly in terms of trade and investment and the role of the private sector, is important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are -- we have faced a difficult time in our own country, as have some of our partners elsewhere, in sustaining the levels of our commitment for foreign assistance. But that level still is there. And in the waning days of this recent Congress, the secretary, the president and others have managed to ensure that the United States will have the sufficient means to continue our engagement in Africa, as elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I think there are some important things we need to draw from our current experience, and one is the necessity of working even more closely with our partners, European and other, in ensuring the most effective use of the assistance that we do make available. But, beyond that, working directly with our partners in Africa to help create that environment that is going to in fact increase investment and trade and commercial opportunity. In the future it is evident that that has to be the driving force behind economic growth, economic development. That was the message that Secretary Brown took to Africa in February; that is the message that Secretary Christopher will be bringing to Africa with him on this trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Bamako, let's return to you for another question for Ambassador Moose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: African countries constantly need assistance, especially material aid.  There is a phenomenon that we don't understand, which many people perhaps are not aware of. What does decentralized cooperation with the United States really involve? We don't understand what kind of decentralized cooperation we should actually be establishing with the United States, and what that actually means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I am not sure I fully understand your question, but let me say a couple of things perhaps in response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a concern generally in the development community, and indeed in the United States, about the phenomenon that we call aid dependency, because ultimately that dependency can be damaging to the self-esteem of African countries and African nations, but also to their long-term efforts to build their own capabilities and capacities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think it is important to know that last year and the year before, '94 and '95, Africa grew by over 3 percent. African economic growth exceeded 3 percent across the continent, and that that growth was widespread -- more than 30 countries of Africa participated in that growth. In some cases those growth rates were substantially above that. That is our hope, and I believe Africa's hope, for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to do more to encourage the role of the private sector, the growth that can only come through the private sector, as the means to ending aid dependency. Now, let me stress here we know that for the foreseeable future in specific areas -- whether it be in population or in environmental protection, or in the effort to deal with diseases and in education -- there are going to be continuing requirements on the African continent for support from the outside. But the long-term hope has to be in helping Africa's own dynamic entrepreneurs assume their rightful role in generating the growth, the sustainable growth in the long term that will improve the living conditions for Africa's people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: My second question is this: As you know, peacekeeping and humanitarian intervention are very expensive operations, very difficult ones which require enormous logistical, technical and financial resources. Ruth Perry, president of the Council of State of Liberia, called upon the international community to respect its ECOMOG commitments to stop the war and to restore peace and democracy in Liberia. Within this framework, the United States committed itself to providing aid to strengthen ECOMOG up to 18,000 troops. We've heard from the media that President Clinton gave his agreement for the creation of an African intervention force, a rapid intervention force, made up of 10,000 troops. My question is: What is the role that you see for regional and subregional organizations, and in the settling of disputes and calming of conflicts? What is your new concept of this whole area? Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Well, thank you for your question. As you know, I was just recently in Bamako discussing with President Konare and with others this very important issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me say one thing first. We understand just how expensive and difficult it is to respond to crises after the fact, to put together peacekeeping operations in order to deal with conflict situations. And that is why we have (placed), and will continue to place a strong emphasis on our collective capacity to prevent crises. That is why we have invested and supported the OAU in the creation, the standing up of its own conflict prevention mechanism.  That must continue to be, I believe, the major emphasis of our effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we also know, frankly, that there are times when our best diplomacy and our best efforts fail us. And in those situations we know that we need a collective capacity to respond; otherwise conflict situations can spread, they can affect the neighboring countries, the can damage the stability and the prospects for prosperity throughout subregions. That is why we have worked with our partners in Europe as well as in Africa in trying to develop an approach to build the capacity of African nations to more effectively respond to crises and situations, whether they be humanitarian crises, conflict situations or natural disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believe that in that there are several things that are important.  Clearly, there is a need for outside support from the United States and from others in order to help build that capacity. But we also know that there are a number of African countries with a demonstrated capacity and with experience in international and regional peacekeeping across the continent.  Some countries, such as Ghana, for example, and Senegal, have as much as 30 years' experience in international and regional peacekeeping. We want to build on that capacity and help to create a capability within Africa to, if necessary and as appropriate, create -- come together in international regional forces that can respond to certain kinds of crisis situations, or forces and elements that can participate in broader international peacekeeping or humanitarian response efforts. We think that is entirely consistent with what the OAU has been trying to do in its efforts in Addis Ababa, and also what some subregional organizations -- ECOWAS on the one hand, SADC on the other -- have been seeking to do. We think there is a complementary role, a contribution that the United States and other outside partners can make to that effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: I want to make my question clear regarding decentralized cooperation.  You know quite well that the prime minister visited the United States at the invitation of President Clinton during the Democratic convention. When he got to Pennsylvania, he heard about decentralized cooperation as a phenomenon which was really becoming more common. I just wanted to know what this concept means. What is it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Well, I think, as I understand the concept, it is something that we have been developing for some time. It is a recognition that the -- all of the expertise, knowledge does not reside in our own federal government when it comes to dealing with particular kinds of problems, and that there are many other organizations out there, whether they be non-governmental organizations, or indeed our own state and local governments which have important contributions that they can bring to bear in helping nations around the world deal with their problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would cite but one example. In the case of South Africa right now, we have a number of our own state governments which are dealing directly with the new provincial governments in South Africa to help them establish the procedures, the structures needed to effectively manage their local governmental issues. I think that is a perfect example of how we can expand the expertise, expand the resources that can be made available, that can be brought to bear in dealing with Africans' development issues and development problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Thank you, Bamako. Let's join our guests now in Addis Ababa. Please go ahead with your questions for Ambassador Moose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: I am... the managing editor of a business and financial private paper.  My question is that you mentioned about African dependency problems, and there are two U.S. Congress members -- namely, Mr. McDermott and Mr. Fred -- (inaudible) -- that they brought a new initiative to Africa to change aid through trade, and they had planned to ship 300 million U.S. dollars from USAID to a sort of private management fund. My question is they have also planned to create a trade area, a U.S.-African free trade area by the year 2000. What is the -- first of all, I would like to know the developments, because last month, in September, they had a plan to develop...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Well, we seem to have lost you. But let me -- I think I understand the thrust of your question, and let me try to respond. The initiative that Congressmen McDermott and Crane have put forward is an extremely important one and a very timely one. It is a recognition of what I said earlier, namely, a recognition of the need that increasingly in the future we need to build on the capacity of the private sector as the engine, as the primary engine of economic growth and economic development in Africa. It is very consistent with the message that Secretary Ron Brown brought with him to Africa during his historic mission in February. It is the same mission and message which Secretary Christopher will be taking with him on this trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposals in the Crane amendment I think are proposals that around which a great deal of debate is now taking place. We regret that in this particular session of Congress there was not adequate time to complete that debate in order to put a specific piece of legislation into effect. But we are confident that in the new year, with the return of Congress, that Congressmen McDermott and Crane have already laid a very solid foundation for us to build on in the new session of Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will say to you, very importantly, one of the concerns we have is that people not fall into a trap of thinking that this is a debate (about) aid on the one side and trade on the other, because for the foreseeable future those two things must go hand in hand. Much of what we have been trying to do -- and indeed other partners have been trying to do with their aid -- is indeed to create the kind of environment, as Secretary Brown used to say, &quot;enabling environment,&quot; that would make it possible for the private sector to operate effectively and freely. That assistance is going to continue to be needed. So what we are talking about is not aid versus trade; we are talking about aid and trade in a partnership as to how they together can overcome the obstacles to economic growth and sustainable development in Africa. That is an important initiative, and I am confident that it will move ahead in the Congress next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: My question will be concerned with the McDermott-Crane trade initiative, which I believe calls for something like a stronger and a closer economic tie between the United States and Africa in the years ahead. Concerning this initiative, you say you may take exceptions to some specific aspects of the proposal. Which specific aspects did you mean, and why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Well, to amplify on my previous answer, I think one of the things that concerned us was the suggestion that we should -- we could deplete our already limited foreign assistance aid programs in order to build this new initiative for investment and trade in Africa. And I think those of us who know the importance of maintaining those levels of aid were concerned that some in the Congress -- some in the Congress -- might exploit that as a means of further cutting our foreign assistance budget. So that was one thing that we took exception to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But let me stress again that the important point that Congressmen McDermott and Crane have made is the absolute necessity for us to focus much more attention on the role of the private sector. In that regard, they have suggested that we seriously consider the notion of the kind of free trade area between Africa and the United States. I think realistically the experts - - and I don't profess to be one -- say that that's not something that can be accomplished in the short term. But the important point again is that we all agree that there are things that can be done in the short run, particularly to improve and enhance African access to international markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Africa develops, as it begins to create new industries, those industries will not be able to prosper and survive unless there are outlets for their products. And so one of the things we would like to focus very much on in the next year is how we can give added, enhanced access to African producers, African industries, to the global marketplace. That is, I think, one of the most important contributions that we in the United States could make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second important contribution is that we need to figure out more effective ways of financing our projects and project development in Africa.  This is something that we have heard not only from our African partners, but, frankly, increasingly from our own American businesses, that they feel a need to have some additional mechanisms for financing their exports as well as their projects in Africa. Those are key elements that I think have emerged from the debate over the Crane-McDermott amendment, and which will be central to our discussion in the new year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Last year before you made a visit to three African countries you made a statement that U.S. key focus in 1996 will be getting together with African private sector, or -- I would like -- what your achievements or what you have done in 1996 regarding this major focus or major concern of the United States to work with the private sector of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And my second question is: Do you have any plan to talk to the people in the private sector on this visit of yours? Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Indeed. I am delighted with the emphasis that you are placing on our activities in the private sector, because again I think they are extremely critical, both to the contribution I believe the United States -- not only the government of the United States, but the American private sector -- can make to Africa's development, but also extremely important to the partnerships that are already developing between American businesses and African businesses in order to realize that potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me mention simply two things. As an outgrowth of Secretary Brown's visit in February of this year, a number of initiatives were taken. For example, there is the proposal for a reverse trade mission from the states of East Africa to the United States. That is, I think, a direct outgrowth of our efforts to improve and enhance the discussion, the dialogue, and indeed the partnerships, between Africa and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd also mention that very similarly to that we have worked closely with our colleagues in the private sector here in the United States. I would mention specifically the Corporate Council on Africa, which earlier this year led a very important mission of American business people to Ethiopia and to Eritrea. That too, which we supported from the U.S. government, our Department of Commerce and others, is another illustration of how we hope to bring some added impetus to our efforts to promote the role of the U.S.  private sector in Africa, and indeed the role of the African private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Obviously, among the Africa's ... one type or set of problems that hinder progress towards sustained economic growth, a severe... absence of relatively skilled labor forces (inaudible). In this connection, doesn't the recent immigration of thousands of Africans to the United States adapt to the already existing problem of human resource impoverishment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: The problem that you highlight is indeed a critical element in the efforts to build Africa's own capacity to deal with its own and social development problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer to that is not, I think, for the United States to impose restrictions on the movements of people from Africa or elsewhere to the United States; it is indeed to continue the efforts to create conditions in Africa which make economic growth possible, and which thereby create the opportunity that will attract people with talents to remain in their own countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think it's important to note that since 1991, with the transition in Ethiopia, we are increasingly seeing members of the Ethiopian community here in the United States returning home in order to make their contribution to Ethiopia's development. I've seen a similar phenomenon with respect to Eritrea -- with respect to Ghana, for example, where over the last 10 years Ghana has achieved economic growth rates of as much as 7 or 8 or 9 percent.  What that has meant is new opportunities for those people with skills and talents, and so that many of those people are now beginning to return home in order to contribute to the development of their own countries. I think one of the universals here is -- that I have found in my conversations with Africans resident here in the United States -- is their universal desire to find ways to make their skills and their talents contribute to the development of their own nations. That's the natural tendency on the part of all of us. But the solution, once again, is to continue the efforts of economic reform, which are beginning to turn around the decline in growth rates, and beginning therefore to create the opportunities which will attract and hold those skilled people, those very talented Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other point I simply would make is the obvious one, and that is that we need to continuous -- this is why we need to continue with assistance programs. There are certain things that are essential underpinnings of private sector development, and one of those is the training of a skilled labor force. In various ways our investments, those of the United States and others, in education are key critical elements in building that human potential so that in fact the skills will be there to take advantage of the new emerging economic opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How do you see your new initiative to trade with Africa with the fact that American exports to Africa (are) less in 1995 from 1994 by 23 percent?  And the second thing is that you didn't answer my question whether you have a plan to talk to people in the private sector in this trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I didn't answer your question. Yes, indeed we do. The secretary -- we have sought several opportunities, including one in Ethiopia, for the secretary to meet with members of our private sector as well as with the indigenous private sector. And that's the case on other stops as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On your question about the importance of the African market to the American business community, I would correct you in one sense. In fact, American exports to Africa grew over the past year by about a billion dollars. It was - - if I recall correctly, and please don't hold me to this figure -- about $5, 400 million. I would also point out that that value of U.S. exports to Africa exceeds the value of U.S. exports to the former Soviet Union, the newly independent states of the Soviet Union, or to Eastern Europe, which suggests again how important the African market is for America. And that is not counting what we regard as the important future potential of that marketplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the reverse side of that, I would simply say that America is the largest purchaser of goods and products from Africa. It is -- we are in global terms the country that purchases the most goods and services from Africa. But we are not satisfied with that, because as I said earlier, Africa currently is only -- only participates to the extent of 1 or 2 percent in the total trade of the global economy. That is insufficient and unsatisfactory. We need to find ways to enhance Africa's ability to access international markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We think that the World Trade Organization's framework gives us an opportunity both to improve African producers' ability to make their goods available on the market, but also to provide incentives for production in African countries. We think that Africans need to be much more heavily engaged in the discussions and debates of the WTO to make sure that that potential is in fact being realized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: We thank you, Addis Ababa. We will now join our guests in Dar es Salaam.  Welcome. Please go ahead there in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Your ambassador to the U.N., Madeleine Albright, is quoted to have said that the U.S. would like a new U.N. secretary-general elected who will steer the organization to the 21st century, the qualities which according to you Boutros-Ghali does not possess. But, on the contrary, most Third World countries, and some of your closest allies, support Boutros-Ghali for another term. Why do you continue to block Boutros-Ghali's reelection, in view of the eminent majority support he appears to command? And do you think you are trampling on democracy, which your country so much cherishes, by suppressing the wishes of the majority U.N. member states?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Well, Ambassador Albright's statement is indeed a reflection, an accurate reflection, of the view of this administration, including President Clinton. And this is without any negative criticism of anyone about what has happened in the past. What we are looking at here is in fact an opportunity for a democratic solution to a problem. What we are looking for is an opportunity for the international community to choose the person who is best qualified in order to lead our organization, the United Nations, into the 21st century. It is no secret that our organization, the United Nations, is in serious difficulty, that it is not currently able to meet its challenges, its obligations to assume the role we would all wish it to assume in the international community, whether it is in terms of its ability to organize missions for peacekeeping or international security, or whether it is in terms of its capacity to respond to the development challenges in Africa and elsewhere. It is critically important for all of us that our organization, the United Nations, be effective, be capable of assuming that role and that responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in order to do that, that organization, our organization, is going to require major restructuring and reform in the years to come. If that doesn't happen, I fear personally that the United Nations will cease to be a meaningful or effective organization for any of us. I think that is particularly true for Africa. Nowhere is the development challenge greater than it is for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would simply say that I have found in my discussions an openness to the question of how we together come to a consensus about who is best qualified to lead our organization in the future. We in the United States are anxious to engage in that consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Dar es Salaam, we will be returning to you in just a moment. Mr.  Ambassador, a question if I may: Is it not true that Mr. Boutros Boutros- Ghali, when he accepted the position, agreed to serve only one five-year term?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Indeed. Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali at the time of his first term did indicate publicly and to us and to others his intention to serve for only one term. I think we had all based our considerations and our calculations on that statement. By the same token, we are aware -- we are certainly sensitive to the desire on the part of African countries to see an African continue to lead the United Nations. I personally know and believe that there are many Africans qualified and capable to assume that leadership role. I would hope that Africa itself would quickly undertake the search, the consultation, that would help us all make a decision on how to select a person capable of leading the organization into the next century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Thank you. Let's return to Dar es Salaam for more questions for the ambassador.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: I work for the East African regional newspaper in East Africa. I have one question for Ambassador Moose. Two months before Pierre Buyoya of Burundi took power by force, President Clinton's adviser Anthony Lake warned, and I quote, &quot;If any group seizes power by force, you should know that the U.S.  will see to it that they are isolated by the international community and feel the full weight of international law.&quot; But what we are seeing now is Buyoya took power by force, and the United States is giving Buyoya a chance. What has shaped the U.S. (favorable approach ?) to Buyoya now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I was on that trip with National Security Adviser Lake, and let me say that nothing he said there has changed since he said it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have worked as hard and as closely with the states of the subregion, particularly with Tanzania, as anyone, to try to ensure that there is both a successful diplomacy leading to a political solution in Burundi -- that has not changed our objectives -- and I had a chance to talk with President Mkapa when I was just there last week -- our objectives are identical -- identical - - to those of the states of the region. We think it is extremely important that pressure be maintained on President Buyoya because his regime is not legal -- it is the result of a coup -- and because it is critically important that he understand the need to move towards a successful political settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We think it is also important that the other players, the other parties to this terrible tragedy in Burundi, also understand the necessity on their part, their obligation, to behave in a way that contributes to a political solution. That is a view which is I think consistent among the members of the Great Lakes region. We know that there is a very important summit meeting that will be coming up in Arusha on the 11th and 12th of October. Indeed, Secretary Christopher plans to be in Arusha at that time. We see that as an important opportunity to further consolidate our collective effort to try to bring about a solution to the Burundi crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Dar es Salaam, we thank you for your questions and your comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we go to Cape Town. Please go ahead in Cape Town, South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Mr. Ambassador, it seems rather curious that the State Secretary is making his first trip to Africa during the last weeks of the first Clinton administration, and perhaps during his own last weeks as secretary of state.  Given the fact that he is widely believed to be due to retire within a few months, why is Secretary Christopher planning to come to Africa at this time?  Is this not something -- an afterthought for the administration, perhaps aimed at the elections of November?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: As I said earlier, and frankly, the secretary, had he had his druthers, would have made this trip some time ago. I think the opposite of your question is that since it is the waning days of the first administration, why go at all? Well, I think it's because that the issues and the concerns of this administration remain as they have been. We believe that there is an ongoing requirement for U.S. engagement in Africa. That doesn't change because we happen to have an election coming up in a few weeks time. We think it's important that we build on what we have been -- what we have tried to accomplish over the last four years as we look to the next four years, regardless of what happens in those elections here in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretary has made a particular commitment this year, which will be reflected in the course of his trip, and in the aftermath of his trip, that matters to try to reverse the terrible trend that we have seen over the last several years with regard to the -- our ability, our capacity to support development broadly speaking in Africa. He feels strongly that we have reached a critical point in our own budgeting process, our ability to provide the resources necessary to sustain our engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the things that I know he intends to get out of this trip is the example of positive progress in South Africa and elsewhere that he can bring back and bring to bear on the public debate here in the United States about our role, our engagement, our commitment -- internationally, but specifically in Africa. That -- I mean, I do think that this trip more than anything else reflects the secretary's own personal sense of responsibility and obligation to making sure that in the broader scheme of international policy Africa is not lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Mr. Secretary, there is some danger some believe that political crisis in the Middle East, and Secretary Christopher's particular attention to that problem, that this African trip may be called off at the last moment. Can you give us any assurance that that won't take place?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I can't give you an absolutely hard assurance, but I can tell you that we met with the secretary again this morning, and the trip is still on, and his commitment to making that trip is still firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Secretary Christopher will be making a major policy address to the South African Institute of International Affairs on Saturday of his trip. Can you give us any indication or broad outline of the themes of that talk?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Well, I am certainly not going to try to steal the secretary's thunder here, but I think you can well imagine the themes that he will be stressing.  He will be stressing our fundamental belief in the importance of the continued development of democratic institutions and processes and practices in Africa. If anything, our experience and our modest contribution and support for South Africa's transition has reinforced us in the belief that it is important for us to continue that kind of effort elsewhere across the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you know, Secretary Christopher was instrumental in the creation here in the State Department of a Bureau of Human Rights, and I have no doubt that in his various stops he will be emphasizing the importance we continue to attach to that. His stop in Arusha and his visit to the international tribunal will be an important highlighting of the role of that institution in preventing -- or certainly punishing those responsible for crimes against humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will be stressing, as we have throughout, our efforts to support African nations and African institutions to respond to crises; but, more importantly, to try to prevent crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And last, but not least, he will be making a special appeal on the importance of dealing with those key elements of sustainable development, including the environment and population. As you may know -- you may recall in his speech in Stanford a few months ago, back in the spring, he launched a special initiative from the State Department on issues of the environment. He has followed up on that in several visits -- trips he has made to other parts of the world. And I am confident that in his trip to Africa, and especially in South Africa, he will want to stress the importance that the United States attaches to assisting Africa deal with and manage its incredibly rich environmental heritage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So those are the things I expect you might hear. But, again, I think he may have something other -- something perhaps a little new and fresh to offer on all of those subjects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Mr. Ambassador, I think the African continent feels that although America does pay attention, a great deal of attention to the problem of conflict resolution here in Africa, it doesn't always put its money where its mouth is. Why is there so much reluctance on the part of America to commit its own troops to helping the resolution of conflicts in Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Well, I think, frankly, that if you look at (it) historically that that doesn't hold up. We have committed troops to Somalia, we have committed troops to major humanitarian response to a crisis in Rwanda, and variously we have contributed troops to other African peacekeeping initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But let me also say that in any given year, over the past few years -- the past three years of this administration -- at any one time there have been upwards of 20,000 American troops committed to international peacekeeping efforts around the world. And the administration has made quite clear its continuing commitment to participate in international peacekeeping and humanitarian response. But it is also quite obvious that no country -- not the United States, not anyone else -- can be everywhere all the time in response to every crisis. That is why the president sent us on our recent mission to talk with partners in Africa and in Europe about how we enlarge the collective capacity of all of us to deal with crises, whether they be in Africa or elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been doing things around the world to help build the ability, the capacity of national militaries to participate more effectively and more rapidly in crisis response and international peacekeeping. We have done that in Europe in our Partnership for Peace program; we have done it in helping the Balkan states create a battalion which is now participating in Bosnia; we have done it in Latin America with our exercises with our Latin American partners to improve their peacekeeping capabilities. We think it's time to do the same in Africa, to build a collective capacity to respond to crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think it is clear that we -- all of us need to look at how we can more rapidly and more effectively deal with crisis situations, whether they occur in Africa or elsewhere. We believe -- we know that there are African countries that have both the tradition, the capacity and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the experience to make an important contribution there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Two questions. First, is the secretary going to be seeing opposition figures as well as ANC figures on his trip to South Africa? And, secondly, I understand there is a possibility that he might be making some contribution from the United States to Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission - - I wonder if that might not go further into opening up the CIA and other intelligence files from the years -- intelligence agencies -- to help the TRC in its work?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Well, I frankly can't -- I am not sure that there is much I can say about your second question. But on your first, yes, indeed. In virtually all of the stops the secretary does hope to meet not only with members of government, but with members of the opposition and other elements of civil society that we believe play an important role in building the democratic process and building civil society -- making an important contribution.  That's certainly the case in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do -- I know also the secretary does hope to have a chance to meet with Bishop Tutu, because we value the role of the contributions that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been making to South Africa's own efforts at reconciliation and consolidating its democratic transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: We thank you, Cape Town. While Luanda, Angola, cannot participate live, they sent in some questions by fax. Ambassador Moose, let me read one or two of them to you, if I may. Luanda asks: What do you think of the peace process in Angola? Are you optimistic about it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: We know that this is indeed a very critical phase in this peace process.  It is the moment at which a lot of things need to come together, and we believe need to come together promptly, in order to ensure continued momentum and the consolidation of the significant progress that has already been made.  I think it is important to acknowledge what has already been accomplished.  The United States was instrumental in reinitiating the negotiations in and around Angola back in 1993. It was one of the first initiatives that we took.  There were a lot of people at the time who believed that we were wasting our time, that given the experience of October 1992 there was nothing that could be accomplished in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record, I think, speaks for itself. Not only was there the successful conclusion of the Lusaka negotiations, the Lusaka Protocol, but now we are well into the implementation of that agreement, with some 60,000 UNITA troops quartered, with a number of other key elements of that process already under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we are mindful that unless the momentum can be sustained that the process is still subject to setback and to jeopardy. That is why the secretary has decided to lend his further weight to the effort to move the process forward. We think it's important for the government's side to exercise maximum restraint and patience, just as we think it's critically important that UNITA honor its commitments and its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol. Those are the two messages that the secretary will bring with him, and that are part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the successful implementation of the Lusaka agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Mr. Ambassador, you have in part answered the next question that Luanda had -- but I'll ask it anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Surely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What will the U.S. do further to move the peace process forward? Would you like to elaborate on that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Well, I think there are several important contributions that we can make, and not necessarily alone, but in partnership with others who share our concern and attach the same importance to this process -- our troika partners for example, Russia and Portugal, as well as the members of the Southern African Development Community who only this week hosted an important summit meeting in Luanda to underscore their commitment to the peace process in Angola. But beyond that we have made I think an important contribution along with others to the consolidation of peace, to the process of demobilization, to the process of repatriating refugees and displaced persons from outside the country, to the critically important de-mining effort in Angola, which is key to enabling people to return to their homes. All of these are contributions which we in the United States and others can make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would underscore one final area, and that is we know that the process of reconciliation in Angola, given the history of tension, of conflict, of mistrust, must continue, and indeed must deepen. We are prepared -- we stand ready -- we have committed to working with UNITA as well as the government in helping to strengthen those institutions -- the parliament, the judiciary, the press -- which are key to that ongoing process of reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Mr. Ambassador, that's all the time we have for today's dialogue. I would like to thank Assistant Secretary George Moose for taking time out to discuss U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's upcoming trip to Africa.  Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Thank you, Jim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Good to have you here. And our thanks to our panelists in South Africa, in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Mali, and questions from Angola. Thank you for your participation. For Worldnet's &quot;Dialogue,&quot; I am Jim Harriott. Have a good day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON, D.C. - During a four-day World Congress of Free Nigerians (WCFN) in Washington, DC, USA, (September 26- 29, 1996) attended by delegates from Africa, Europe and the Americas, members of the Congress deliberated on the problems created for their country by successions of military dictatorships in general and by the current military dictatorship in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congress salutes the courage of the leadership of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), the United Democratic Front of Nigeria, (UDFN) and other pro-democracy organizations inside and outside Nigeria who have since the annulment of the June 12th 1993 elections been championing the struggle for the restoration of democracy in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congress expressed solidarity with the strike action of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), now in its eighth month and called upon parallel organisations of university academics in the international community to express their solidarity by coming to the aid of their beleaguered colleagues in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congress expresses its deepest gratitude to the governments of Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand and others, and nongovernmental organizations who have helped to sustain the struggle so far.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congress agreed on the following resolutions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. That the mandate expressed by the Nigerian people on June 12th, 1993 expressed the sovereignty of the people and that this sovereignty cannot be surrendered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That the political class must not participate in the ongoing transition programme of the Abacha regime, as participation in this sham is tantamount to surrender of that popular mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. That the general civil disobedience by Nigerians already in place should be continued and widened. This includes acts of noncooperation with the regime on all matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. That a Parliament-In-Exile (PIE) be established immediately and that the inaugural meeting of the PIE shall be held within three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. That the PIE should draw up proposals for a Sovereign National Conference in Nigeria and a model civilian constitution for Nigeria to replace unitary constitutions that have, since 1966, been foisted on Nigeria by military dictatorships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. That Nigeria should return to the parliamentary system of government when democracy is restored to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. That the PIE will be a unified legislative organ of all Nigerian pro- democracy groups and will serve as the primary voice of the alternative to General Abacha and military dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. That the PIE shall set up an all-civilian constitution- drafting committee to prepare a model draft of a constitution that restores genuine federalism to Nigeria, for approval by Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. That the PIE shall examine in detail the following proposals: a) restructuring of the Nigerian federation into viable selfsustaining regions which shall not be less than six nor more than ten in number; b) allocation of functions among federal, regional, and local governments, including provisions for autonomous areas; and c) revenue allocation and other constitutional matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. That the PIE shall enshrine in our constitution that the minimum rights of all Nigerians shall be in accordance with the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, and other human rights charters to which Nigeria is a party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. That there should be enshrined in our constitution, drastic deterrents against planned or accomplished overthrow of democratic government. The statute of limitation would not be applicable to such crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. That the PIE shall examine the total restructuring and reorientation of the military to ensure they return to constitutional role of defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Nigeria, acting under orders of a democratic civil authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. That the PIE shall set up an international panel of jurists to draw up an indictment against Generals Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha, for crimes against humanity by past and present military regimes under their command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. That the PIE shall prepare model bills on human rights, the political and economic empowerment of women, the environment, education, science and technology, and the preservation of our culture and heritage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. That the PIE shall set up a committee to prepare model draft bills on corruption and on drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. That General Abacha must release immediately all political detainees, including MKO Abiola, Beko RansomeKuti, Frank Kokori, Shehu Sani, A. A.  Adesanya, Ganiyu Dawodu, Ayo Adebanjo, and hundreds of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. In view of persistent reports that Ayo Opadokun has been killed by agents of the Abacha regime and not released as claimed by the regime, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) should be called upon to investigate the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">18. Congress resolves that the Planning Committee of the Congress together with such persons as it may coopt (a) to submit proposals to Head of delegations on the composition of the PIE and (b) to maintain continuity and sustain contact among pro-democracy groups and individuals between congresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">19. As a symbol of our rejection of the military regime, we henceforth cease to recognise the current Nigerian national anthem. Henceforth, whenever Nigerians congregate at nonofficial functions, they should sing the old democratic anthem, Nigeria We Hail Thee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">20. That, recognizing education as the bedrock of a democratic society and the key to successful development of a nation, compulsory and free secondary education, both grammar and technical, should be provided in all parts of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adopted 29th September 1996</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Following is a revised briefing issued October 9 by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs Integrated Regional Information Network on the conflict in South Kivu, Zaire &amp; its regional implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During September 1996 a growing number of reports testified to human rights abuses against Zairean Tutsis, known as Banyamulenge, by the army and local people in and around Uvira in South Kivu, Zaire. It soon became clear that at the same time a conflict between the Banyamulenge and the army was taking place, and as refugees began to arrive in Rwanda and Burundi, the Governments of Zaire and Rwanda traded accusations over responsibilities for the escalating crisis. As tensions between the two countries mounted, mortar fire was exchanged between Bukavu, Zaire and Cyangugu in Rwanda over several days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This briefing describes developments in September and seeks to put them in their historical context. It gives an account of the immigration of Banyamulenge into Zaire, examines their claims to Zairean nationality and describes how they have been stripped of their nationality and targetted by the local authorities, army and local people since April 1995. Drawing parallels between this crisis and developments in Masisi and Rutshuru over the past year, it examines the accusations of both Zaire and Rwanda, as well as the humanitarian and regional implications of the crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEVELOPMENTS DURING SEPTEMBER 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 9 September local people in Uvira town mounted a demonstration against Banyamulenge, declaring Uvira a 'ville morte', calling on the 'foreigners' to leave the country and attacking their homes and property. The demonstration followed a weekend in which soldiers from the Zairean Army had broken into several religious establishments in the town, arresting local church members and missionaries and seizing vehicles, documents and communications equipment.  The events prompted the German arm of Caritas to announce it had suspended its activities in the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports soon emerged that during the weekend of 6 - 8 September, five Banyamulenge had been killed by Zairean soldiers. One man, Bolingo Karema, was allegedly beaten and stoned to death in Uvira town, while four others were killed in surrounding villages. The offices of a local Banyamulenge NGO, Groupe Milima, had allegedly been looted by soldiers, while its director, Muller Ruhimbika, was in hiding after a warrant had been issued for his arrest. Mr Ruhimbika had played a prominent role in drawing attention to the situation in Uvira during 1995 and the first half of 1996 (see the following section), and is currently living in exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over subsequent days the army sought out Banyamulenge, arresting men while allowing women and children to go free. The arrests were reportedly carried out at the instruction of the District Commissioner of Uvira, Shweka Mutabazi.  Amnesty International singled Mr Mutabazi out for criticism, citing reports that he had encouraged the takeover of Tutsi property and authorized the enrolment of youths into the armed forces to fight the 'Tutsi armed group'.  Amnesty also undertook to investigate reports that more than 35 Banyamulenge had been 'extrajudicially executed' by the Zairean authorities and more than 50 others 'disappeared' at the start of the month.(1)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of fighting between Banyamulenge militia and Zairean soldiers also began to emerge, with three soldiers reported killed during the week beginning 9 September. The Zairean Army declared the Uvira area a 'military zone' and was reported to be reinforcing its presence with troops from Goma, Bukavu, Shaba and Kinshasa. On 13 September the Zairean Government accused Rwanda of having enrolled 3,000 Banyamulenge in its army and of training and infiltrating them to destabilize eastern Zaire, with Burundi providing them with rear bases. Both Governments categorically rejected the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time Banyamulenge, some of whom had been held in detention, were refouled or fled the country and began entering Rwanda and Burundi.  Several hundred refugees were reported as having reached Cyangugu in Rwanda and others as having gone to Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces in Burundi. At the end of the month UNHCR estimates put the number of recent Banyamulenge arrivals at over 500 in Rwanda and over 400 in Burundi. Of this number 535 people had been 'refouled' by the Zairean authorities and the rest had left Zaire spontaneously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the weekend of 14 and 15 September Zairean television reported accusations by the authorities that the UNHCR and IOM (International Organisation of Migration) had been assisting armed groups to infiltrate Zaire from Rwanda and Burundi with the aim of destabilizing Kivu. Following these accusations two UNHCR staff were beaten up by Zairean soldiers. On 17 September the claims were dismissed by the UN Secretary-General, as being 'completely unfounded'. The Secretary-General subsequently sent Ibrahima Fall as a UN Special Envoy to Zaire to seek clarification on the allegations. The Zairean authorities, meanwhile, confirmed that the activities of IOM throughout Zaire had been suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday 22 September the growing tension between Rwanda and Zaire manifested itself in an exchange of mortar fire between the two countries.  This was repeated during the following two days, killing one Zairean and injuring five others. It also prompted the United Nations to relocate 23 'non- essential' expatriate aid agency personnel to Nairobi and the International Federation of the Red Cross to evacuate three of its delegates, after two shells landed in the garden of a hotel where IFRCS staff had been staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda and Zaire accused each other of having started the exchanges of fire.  On 23 September the Government of Rwanda released a statement detailing its version of events. It accused the Government of Zaire of targetting Kabembe town in Cyangugu prefecture with automatic weapons fire and artillery shelling between 6pm and 11pm on 22 September. These attacks were said to have caused neither injuries nor material damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan Government linked this alleged 'act of aggression' with an attack in mid-September on the prison in the neighbouring commune of Gishoma, in which a group of infiltrators had sought to free prisoners. According to the statement, the RPA 'repulsed the attackers, who fled under cover of automatic weapons fire from the Panzi camp in Zairean territory.'(2) The dispute over who had started the attacks continued, however, although a ceasefire was agreed on 25 September. Zaire alleged that Rwanda broke the ceasefire on 26 and 29 September, a claim denied by Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time a Banyamulenge spokesman in exile reported that on 22 September the Zairean authorities had executed 40 Banyamulenge being held in detention. They had been arrested by the authorities the previous week at Baraka in Fizi zone. The summary executions were said to have been in retaliation for the killings of Zairean soldiers by Banyamulenge militia.  Independent confirmation of this incident has yet to be obtained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 22 September the Zairean authorities also repeated allegations that soldiers were infiltrating into Kivu from Rwanda and Burundi in order to support the Banyamulenge militia. Government spokesman Oscar Lugendo was quoted in the press as saying that Zairean troops killed three 'Rwandan' soldiers and captured five others at Kiringye in Uvira region on 31 August.  He claimed that the infiltrators were being commanded by Banyamulenge who had been officers in the Zairean Army but had gone to Rwanda after the victory of the RPA in July 1994. (3) The authorities said the soldiers had infiltrated Uvira via Cyangugu in Rwanda and Cibitoke in Burundi.  BACKGROUND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Different historians give different dates for the migrations of Tutsi pastoralists from the historic kingdom of Rwanda to what is now Zaire. All of the estimates, however, date the migrations between the 16th and 19th centuries (4). The atlas of the Republic of Zaire produced by Jeune Afrique in 1978 provides a map showing the routes of the major historical population movements into and within what is now Zaire, and dates the movement of pastoralists from Rwanda into Kivu between the 17th and 18th centuries. This was part of the migration which also brought Rwandan Tutsis to Masisi and Rutshuru zones in what is now North Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights in Zaire states with confidence that 'ever since 1797, under the rule of Yuhi IV Gahindiro, Rwandan Tutsis have emigrated to the Congo, settling in Kakamba, in the plain of Ruzizi and in the higher regions (Mulenge Hills), because of the climate and to feed their cattle.' (5)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These Tutsis established their first settlement at Mulenge and became known as Banyamulenge (people of Mulenge). They settled in Uvira, Mwenga and Fizi zones, where they are to be found to this day (although there are now Banyamulenge living further south, in Shaba, and in major towns around the country). Establishing their own settlements they lived side-by-side with indigenous Bantu ethnic groups - the Babembe, Bafulero, Banyindu, Barega, Barundi and Bashi. They speak a variant of Kinyarwanda (the language of Rwanda), recognized as a separate dialect by linguistic authorities (6).  Today estimates of their number range from 250,000 to 400,000 people, roughly comparable with other ethnic groups in the area (the Barega have been estimated at 400,000, the Babembe at 252,000 and the Bafulero at 275,000).(7)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge lived in relative peace and harmony with their neighbours for most of this century. It was not until the Mulele rebellion in Kivu in 1964 that Banyamulenge found themselves in opposition to other local people.  The Mulelists, espousing a variant of communist philosophy in which property, land and cattle were to be shared among local people, drew support from other ethnic groups in South Kivu. The Banyamulenge, however, did not share their neighbour's enthusiasm for these goals and helped the then Congolese National Army to crush the movement in South Kivu. This episode instilled a deep and lingering resentment against the Banyamulenge within other ethnic groups in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge, however, continued to prosper economically and also succeeded in securing political representation at both the local and national levels. In 1980 however, Mr Gisaro, the sole Banyamulenge MP in the Zairean Parliament, died in a car crash. In 1981 the Zairean Parliament passed new legislation relating to Zairean nationality. This sought to nullify the 1972 legislation under which all persons of Rwandese origin who established their residence in the Kivu province before 1 January 1950 and who had continued to reside in Zaire were collectively granted Zairean nationality as of 30 June 1961.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henceforth nationality would be acquired on an individual basis only and any other mode of acquisition of Zairean nationality was null and void. In effect, people of Rwandese origin in Zaire were rendered stateless persons.  According to informed legal opinion, however, the 1981 law was arbitrary and discriminatory and therefore unlawful under international conventions to which Zaire is a party. If this analysis is accepted, the Banyamulenge retained a strong claim to Zairean citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were, however, refused permission to stand as candidates or to vote in the 1982 Parliamentary elections. Banyamulenge in Mwenga zone protested against the decision by burning ballot boxes being used in the elections. The same was true for the 1987 Parliamentary elections, when again the Banyamulenge could neither stand for office nor cast a vote. This time there were protests in Uvira and Fizi and again ballot boxes were burnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tensions aroused by these disputes were further exacerbated by the refugee crises of 1993 and 1994, when Hutu refugees first from Burundi and then from Rwanda, flooded into the area. Local people are said to identify themselves with Hutus and to hold Tutsis responsible for heaping the refugee problem upon them through the coup of October 1993 in Burundi and their struggle for power in Rwanda after the RPF invasion of 1990. In this analysis the genocide of 1994 was characterized as the culmination of a war rather than the planned and purposeful extermination of Rwanda's Tutsi minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 28 April 1995 the High Council of the Transitional Parliament passed a Resolution in order, ostensibly, to prevent Rwandan and Burundian refugees from acquiring Zairean nationality. The Resolution followed a visit to Kivu by the Vangu commission of inquiry, which had been established to look into these questions. The most surprising aspect of the Resolution was that it treated the Banyamulenge as recent refugees. The Resolution included a list of people to be arrested and expelled, the cancellation of any sale or transfer of assets which benefited 'immigrants who have acquired Zairean nationality fraudulently', the replacement of existing governors and commanders with new officials, and the banning of Tutsis from all administrative and other posts. (8) The Resolution was signed by the Speaker of the Parliament, Anzuluni Bembe Isilonyonyi, who claims to come from Uvira and have Babembe ancestry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't long before the Resolution was put into action. On 19 September the District Commissioner of Uvira, Shweka Mutabazi, wrote to the official responsible for urban planning in Uvira telling him to make a list of the properties and land owned by Banyamulenge, that all building work by Banyamulenge was to be brought to a halt and that all abandoned Banyamulenge houses should be identified and itemized. He also charged the same official with informing the head of the Banyamulenge community about these developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During late 1995 and early 1996 acts of harrassment as well as evictions of Banyamulenge were an increasingly common occurence. On November 21 1995 the authors of a petition to the authorities were detained, shortly after one of their number, Muller Ruhimbika, had been interviewed by the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Zaire, Roberto Garreton. During his January 1996 report Mr Garreton noted that some Banyamulenge had already been expelled from Zaire while others were under an expulsion order. The Special Rapporteur also reported that he had been informed that 'local tribes were arming in readiness for a struggle against the Banyamulenge, forcing the latter to do the same.'(9)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immediate precursor to the events of September was the banning of Groupe Milima, the non-governmental organization run by Mr Ruhimbika, on 9 August, again at the instigation of the District Commissioner for Uvira.  Groupe Milima, a rural development organization which had lobbied for the nationality rights of Banyamulenge to be recognized, was clearly proving to be a thorn in the side for the authorities. The letter announcing the ban accused Mr Ruhimbika of political lobbying, travelling without the permission of the authorities and drawing the nationality issue to the attention of the Carter Centre. It also alleged that Mr Ruhimbika had been trafficking arms to the Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCLUSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many respects recent developments in Uvira bear an uncanny resemblance to developments in Masisi since November 1995. There too, Zairean Tutsis have been targetted by the local authorities, army and local people and forced to flee their country. In the case of Masisi there is substantial evidence that Rwandan Hutu refugees, in particular members of the interahamwe militia and the former Rwandan Army, have fuelled the conflict by bringing arms and hatred to an already volatile situation (10). In the case of Uvira the alleged involvement of Hutu refugees in targetting the Banyamulenge remains just that - an allegation. With Masisi as with Uvira, the conflicts have resulted in mutual recriminations between Zaire and Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the obvious difference between the two conflicts is that in the case of Masisi the Tutsis were forced out of their country without putting up a fight.  This is not proving to be the case in Uvira, where the Banyamulenge have been arming and preparing themselves for the current confrontation. As one Banyamulenge spokesman in exile explained, &quot;They have seen what has happened in Shaba with the Kasai who were unarmed. They saw what happened to their 'brothers' in Masisi and Rutshuru, who were defenceless and were killed and evicted. The Zairean authorities say the Banyamulenge must go. The only option they had was to get arms. They are saying, 'we're not going to allow this to happen to us'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How the conflict will evolve is a matter of speculation. While reports from the area do support claims that Rwandan Hutu refugees are assisting the Zairean Army, it is unclear to what extent local people from other ethnic groups in South Kivu are willing to take up arms against their neighbours. In the case of Masisi, it was the involvement of local Hutus in league with refugees and occasionally the army that really made the position of the Tutsis untenable and forced them to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is abundantly clear is that unless the legitimate claims of the Banyamulenge are recognized and the differences between Zaire and Rwanda resolved, the region faces yet another escalation in its crisis of insecurity.  This will be unwelcome to the international community, as it counts the cost of assisting yet more internally displaced people and refugees. It will be bad for the countries of the region, whose development can only be hindered by worsening relations and violent disruption. And it will be a disaster for local people, who will be condemned to further deaths, displacement and flight from their own country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two submissions from military leaders -- one from the former SA Defence Force and the other from the new SA National Defence Force -- will be made to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Cape Town on October 21.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major General Jan Klopper, the liaison person between the SANDF and the Commission, contacted me yesterday to inform me that General Georg Meiring, Chief of the SANDF, has confirmed the date for the submissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first submission will be made by General Meiring on behalf of the SANDF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second will be led by Major General Deon Mortimer and will focus on the former SADF. General Klopper pointed out that the SANDF is facilitating the preparation of the both submissions because the SADF no longer exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After considering various options put to them by the Commission, the SANDF has indicated that they would like the submissions handled on the same basis as those of political parties when they appeared last month.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement By Dr Alex Boraine, vice-chairperson of the Truth And Reconciliation Commission, October 3, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will tomorrow begin the process of issuing subpoenas summoning the former Minister of Law and Order, Mr Adriaan Vlok, and former high-ranking police officers to appear at investigative inquiries of the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subpoenas will be issued in terms of Section 29 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, which grants the Commission the power to call upon any person to appear before the Commission to give evidence or to answer questions relevant to the subject matter of the inquiry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notices will be served on each of those being subpoenaed by the Commission's Investigative Unit, requiring them to attend an inquiry at a specified time and place. They will be given 14 days' notice of their appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission will not disclose in advance details of the subject matter of inquiries. The law provides that &quot;no person other than a member of the staff of the Commission or any person required... to give evidence shall be entitled or permitted to attend any hearing conducted in terms of this section (of the Act).&quot; However, the Commission is able to release information about Section 29 hearings at its discretion, or at subsequent public hearings of the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of Section 34 of the Act, any person who is subpoenaed is entitled to appoint a legal representative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to issue subpoenas follows the receipt today of a letter from Generals Johan van der Merwe, Mike Geldenhuys, Johan Coetzee and Hennie de Witt, all former Commissioners of Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their letter, the generals assert that their own knowledge of gross violations of human rights is solely based on general information in police dockets, court records and media reports. They say any possible involvement in violations on their part &quot;may be restricted to limited instances, and even in those instances proper legal advice will have to be obtained in order to determine whether any such instances actually constitute any gross human rights violations...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The generals have also outlined legal problems which they believe make it difficult for them to assist other former members of the police in coming before the Commission. They say that because of the legal obstacles inhibiting them from becoming constructively involved with the Commission, they are unable to furnish further submissions to us at this stage. They remain willing to co-operate with the Commission, but asked us to subpoena them before they provide further details to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 39 of the Act provides for penalties for any person who fails to appear in response to a subpoena without sufficient cause, or who &quot;fails or refuses to answer fully and satisfactorily to the best of his or her knowledge and belief any question lawfully put to him or her...&quot; Those guilty of offences in terms of the Act are liable to fines and/or imprisonment of up to two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has already been publicly reported that the list of policemen upon whom we are considering serving subpoenas includes Generals Van der Merwe, Geldenhuys and Coetzee, Lieutenant Generals Basie Smit and Johan le Roux, and Major Generals Krappies Engelbrecht and Bertus Steyn.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - After staging the extremely successful world cross country championships in March, Stellenbosch once again gets the opportunity to put Cape Town's Olympic bid on the map when it stages the Modern Pentathlon World Cup on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olympian Claud Cloete of Cape Town, who finished 15th in Atlanta out of the 32- strong field, will be looking to home crowd support to boost his chances in the event.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The crowd should be worth at least five places,&quot; said Cloete of the competition which features 16 of the world's best modern pentathletes, including Olympic champion Aleksandr Parygin of Kazakhstan and 1994 and 1995 world champion and world cup-winner Dmitri Svatkovsky of Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The competitors will take part in pistol shooting, fencing, swimming, equestrian and cross country running events in one day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am still strong from Atlanta and with skills events like fencing and show jumping anything can happen on the day,&quot; says Cloete.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Last season's losing finalists Pretoria City (now Supersport United) are no more, but defending champions Cape Town Spurs should have little difficulty in advancing to the quarterfinals of the Bob Save Superbowl when they meet little known Tembisa-based first division side Classics, at the Athlone Stadium on Friday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little liklehood of the Cape side retaining their title this year, as most of last season's double-winning squad has left the club for greener pastures, and though they have the committment, the skills might not be there for Sergio Dos Santos's boys to go all the way this time round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng-based sides usually struggle with the conditions at Athlone in night games, and if a side of the calibre of Pirates find it difficult to handle Spurs at night, then it will definitely not be a &quot;Classic&quot; evening for the minnows, who might just as well enjoy the trip to the coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another game on Friday night, Wits host Jomo Cosmos in one of four all- Premier League clashes which take place over the next three days. A game between these two clubs has over the past few years always turned into a no- holds barred grudge match resulting in a niggling, robust contest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wits were the side to seal the fate of Cosmos in the final game of the season when Jomo Sono's side were relegated at the end of the 1993 season.  Wits, to make matters worse, have been finding it easier to score in their own net than their opponents' this season, having scored three own goals in their last two games. Extra time, or even penalties, might be needed to separate the two sides, but one thing is certain - the soccer will be of a very high quality. Both games kick off at 8pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Beautiful Birds&quot;, Moroka Swallows, will attempt to get their &quot;train to the top&quot; on its way on Saturday when they host Kaizer Chiefs at Ellis Park Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To add spice to the event, Walter Da Silva, the man fired by Swallows a few months ago, will be on the Chiefs bench, and there is little doubt he will want to show his former employers a thing or two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Saturday's only other game, Vaal Professionals travel to Durban for a clash agaist local first division side Tongaat Crusaders, and on paper are favourites to reach the next round of the competition, just as they were last season before they played Port Elizabeth amateurs, Park United. We all know what happened then, as the outsiders ousted the Vaal Monsters, then defending champions, from the competition. It is unlikely that the same will happen tomorrow, but these days with all that is happening in soccer, you never know what could happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the subject of Park United, they host Pietersburg outfit Real Rovers on Saturday, and look set to cause another major upset, depending of course on if the Rovers players are on strike or not. If they are (as they usually seem to be) then United could well be in the pound seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having last week accounted for Sundowns, Qwa Qwa Stars are rubbing their hands in anticipation of the clash with Orlando Pirates, whom they host at their new home ground, the Northern Free State rugby stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the Sea Robbers who embarrassed Peter Nyama's boys in the BP Top 8 final at the beginning of the year, and Stars will no doubt be looking to turn the tables. And the way they played last weekend, they could well do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another all-Premier League clash, AmaZulu host Bloemfontein Celtic, the side that last week beat them in a league game. For the Usuthu consistency does not seem to high on the agenda at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So trouble-plagued Celtic and Vasilli Sofiadeles, who scored the goals last time they met, could be on course for a double.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former NSL first division side Santos will attempt to advance to the next round at the expense of Sundowns who are stll licking their wounds after their defeat last weekend to Stars. Nevertheless, they should advance to last eight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All Saturday and Sunday games kick off at 3pm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The By Global Challenge - billed as the world's toughest yacht race - got off to a fast and furious start in driving rain and high winds in Southampton on Saturday, after some four years of preparation and training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 30 000-mile race, which will last about 10 months, involves 14 identical 67-foot steel yachts sailing the &quot;wrong way&quot; around the world against the prevailing winds and currents, on a route taking in stops at Rio de Janeiro, Wellington, Sydney, Cape Town and Boston before returning to Southampton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each yacht is skippered by a professional sailor, but the crews are made up of people aged between 21 and 60 from all walks of life - most with little or no experience prior to their training for the race - who are paying over o18 750 for the experience.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is represented on two yachts, with the Southampton-based Boris Webber skippering Courtaulds International and Worcester farmer Kobus Kotze crewing on Toshiba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After just a few days at sea, the fleet is still fairly tightly bunched, but sea sickness has been common. Said Mike Golding, skipper of Group 4, undoubtedly also echoing the feelings of the other crews: &quot;After an emotional and exciting start, most crew members suffering from effects of rough weather and many seeing Saturday's dinner again. Skipper enjoyed a very large portion of lamb casserole as a result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Challenge is the brainchild of Chay Blyth, and is the second race of its kind following four years after the British Steel Challenge, which had it origins in Blyth's epic singlehanded, non-stop voyage along the same route in 1970-71. The first 5 000-mile leg to Rio is expected to take about four weeks to complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l Reporting on the race from one of the competing yachts, Simon Montague writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I lay in the cockpit, gasping for breath. It was two o'clock in the morning and we were driving into big waves in a near gale. The sailor's worst enemy, sea-sickness, had me in its grip and in two days all I had held down was a banana and a glass of water. We had just completed yet another sail change and, crawling back from a spray-torn foredeck, I felt as if the last ounce of strength had been sapped from me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under the command of Richard Tudor, now a professional skipper, my crew- mates and I find ourselves in the unique position of sailing on the defending champion. We are all keen to repeat the success of three years ago when, after eight months, Nuclear Electric won the British Steel Challenge by the extraordinarily thin margin of 70 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None of us is under-estimating what that means: the daunting prospect of pushing a 40-ton yacht as fast as it will go 24 hours a day for weeks on end.  It is going to demand total concentration by the helmsman and endless trimming and changing of sails in pursuit of boat speed. The reward, or the incentive to push harder, will come with the regular satellite reports plotting our progress relative to the rest of the fleet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is not beyond the bounds of reason to suggest that cricket is a way of life as much as it is a sporting pastime. The cricket club has become a home-away-from- home for more players, ex-players and just pure lovers of the game than perhaps any other sporting institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is - rightly - at this hugely important level that the United Cricket Board (UCB)is addressing a concerted campaign as part of their development programme. &quot;We have to get the clubs involved,&quot; says Ali Bacher. &quot; The leap from development cricket to provincial level is just too great. The cricketers emerging from the development programme need to play club cricket.  We have to fill this relative vacuum.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True. But the existing problem is a bit bigger than that, as Bacher's own apprenticeship in the game attests to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I used to go every week to Balfour Park to play tennis,&quot; he recalls. &quot;One weekend they were short of a player in the fourth side.&quot; Bacher was roped in at the age of 13. It started the playing career of perhaps the most cerebral skipper ever to lead his province and his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to get the kids to the clubs and get them playing at the lower league levels,&quot; says Bacher, mindful of the fact that the generation of emerging players from the disadvantaged communities have still to reach that part of the cycle where they will be taking their own sons along to watch the game at weekends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this, as much as the very necessary priority of getting the development kids playing - and mixing - is lacking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bacher points to the immense pressure on facilities at the Soweto Cricket Club Oval and the initiative taken by the Roodepoort Cricket Club to accommodate players from the parts of Soweto bordering the West Rand municipality. &quot;They've managed to get the kids to come along and it's worked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, however, more to the involvement of the clubs than merely putting out the invitation. There are commitments of both time and money that will have to be made. Equipment costs money. Transport for youngsters - especially those from areas a distance away from the participating clubs - needs organisation. In short, you have to get the kids there, you have to kit them out and help nurture them ... and then you have to get them home safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a tall order and one that will need some UCB financial backing and some Bacher evangelism to get moving and ensure the momentum is maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Bacher says: &quot;It has to work. If it doesn't, nothing works.&quot; Indeed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The smaller unions have taken some humiliating beatings this season and these lopsided clashes aren't good for spectators or players</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the heart of every sporting endeavour is the contest. Without this vital ingredient the game itself ceases to be a spectacle, fails to hold the hearts and minds of the followers and does little for the combatants on the wrong end of a hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it is ironic that over the past two weeks, we have been witness to two great contests and two beatings so severe as to leave the losers on the periphery of the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On two Saturdays, South Western Districts have given up a massive 220 points. To their credit, the men from the impoverished Oudtshoorn-George- Knysna pool of players have managed, in adversity, to claw back 34. Even to the arithmetically challenged though, the gulf is obvious.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contest, and consequently the game, has suffered from the 113-11 hiding from Free State and the 107-23 beating South Western Districts have had to endure in the past fortnight. There is little room for belief that affairs will alter against Northern Transvaal this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, the Free State-Griquas clash at Hoffe Park in Kimberley was as enthralling a match as could have been dreamt of and the 28-28 scoreline could not have spelt it out better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, Free State managed tries by Andre Venter - a superbly opportunistic chargedown from the Springbok flanker - and Werner Swanepoel against the penalty try awarded to the home side. And equally true that while Franco Smith's boot kept Griquas in it with a 23-point haul from seven penalties and a conversion, while his brother MJ had what can only be described as a dismal outing, there is, as the great Boy Louw once said, no remarks column on the scoreboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a different way certainly, this match was every bit as tense and, until the eventual whistle, capable of swinging either way, as was the Transvaal - Natal thriller the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is perhaps stating the obvious to say that sides like Griquas and the Witbank coalminers from South Eastern Transvaal fully deserve their elevated status, have revelled in the speed and toughness of it all and will remain extremely difficult sides to beat on their home turf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griquas have managed seven wins and a draw in their 11-match Currie Cup campaign thus far. The coalminers have done almost as well, notching six wins from 12 games and managing two draws into the bargain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also nothing wrong with the way Boland have fared with six wins from 11 outings at top level. This, though, represents the upside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the other half of the equation has been the disappointing form of Eastern Province with just five log points and, going into the final pool game, trailing Border by a point. It has been something of a landslide from two seasons ago when the pride of Port Elizabeth fought their way into the old Super 10 competition on merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a team which remains one of the great enigmas of South African rugby, a fountainhead of talent, a hive of in- fighting. Interestingly, Grizz Wiley's approach - deemed too domineering for the Transvaal side - really worked in Port Elizabeth. Perhaps it is indicative of the chasm that exists between the residents of the two cities, or maybe it is just that the manne van die Baai react better to a good moering than the jollers in Jo'burg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Border, Northern Free State and the often outgunned Eastern Transvaal have done well enough to merit another shot at the big sides in the competition.  All have competed well with limited resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But right on the fringe lie Western Transvaal and South Western Districts, this season's whipping boys in a very lopsided home-and-away log set-up.  Clearly there are only two options open. Strengthen the sides by pouring in cash for players or players themselves, or drop the bottom sides out of the competition entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this doesn't happen, we will continue to get the kind of inequality of results that have been a feature of this season. And there will continue to be contests that barely qualify for the term.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Perhaps one of the better things about ageing - and there aren't that many - is that you can, given the opportunity, alter the rules to suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly this looks the case with the draw for the up-coming MTN Champions Tournament at Sandton Square - done in Washington and not locally, the organisers hasten to say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortuitously, or so it would seem, the four top seeds - in order, Jose-Luis Clerc, Johan Kriek, John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg - slot into those exact positions in the draw and all the seeds also have a bye into the second round of singles play.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, you must understand, is not a grouse. The draw would certainly have suffered severely if McEnroe was ousted by Clerc in the first round and Borg had to pack his bags after going down to Kriek on the opening day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It couldn't have worked out better the way it is, and who can carp at the rigging of the order of play? Certainly no one who has been champing at the bit to grab a sight of some of the living legends of world tennis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that is not overstating the case. Tickets have become as scarce as rocking- horse manure, forcing the organisers to squeeze in an extra 176 seats for each day's play at the novel outdoor venue rapidly taking shape in the very heart of kugel country. Even then, most of those have already been snapped up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if there is a ticket available for the first two days - and that would seem the best chance for the average fan - it is worth trying for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the first day, Borg teams up with Guillermo Vilas against Kriek and John Fleming in the opening doubles during the afternoon session in a match teeming with possibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following day offers the intriguing prospect of Yannick Noah against the big- serving man from Lookout Mountain, Roscoe Tanner, in the afternoon session, and Fleming against the artistic Vilas in the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vilas of yesteryear had an almost poetic flow to his big topspin game - and, on the more prosaic side, those who saw it can have hardly forgotten his fight-back from match point down against New Zealander Onny Parun to win the old Clows Classic at Ellis Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So forgive the men in Washington a little chicanery. The tennis is, after all, the main event, not the way names come out of an upturned hat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I, for one, can hardly wait to see some of these stars again. Perhaps ageing isn't really that bad after all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Against a background of pink gins and turbans, cricket in Kenya is gaining in popularity with all population groups</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is well known that Africa is a continent as full of contradictions as a pomegranate is of pips, but that does not make the four- nations tournament currently under way in Nairobi any less fascinating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, on Tuesday South Africa played Sri Lanka at the Nairobi Club, a part of some foreign field that is forever England. In the reading room, week-old Financial Times were scrutinised by retired colonels with handle-bar moustaches, while Kenyan waiters came and went noiselessly with trays filled with pink gins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday the South Africans were across town at the Aga Khan Club, a part of some foreign field that is forever India. Here pink gins are not served because it is a Muslim club with a strictly no-alcohol policy and while the handle-bar moustaches are also in evidence, they look a little different surmounted by turbans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nairobi Club is a relic of empire where one expects at any moment to run into David Niven playing the role of Phineas Fogg. There are hunting trophies on the wall, memorials to club members killed in both World Wars and even dormitories modelled scrupulously on a thousand English public schools, for those too drunk to go home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Aga Khan Club is shiny and new, less than 10 years old and just across the road from the even more impressive Aga Khan Hospital. It was this hospital where one of the more bizarre incidents of the 1994 International Cricket Council (ICC) Trophy was acted out. United States fast bowler Hopeton Barrett hit Israel's wicketkeeper on the head with a bouncer, felling the poor man and causing him to be stretchered off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One suspects that anywhere else in the world the chap would have been left to bleed, but this is Africa and no-one saw anything wrong in having an Israeli stitched up at a Muslim hospital. And anyway, there was cricket involved. He was repaired and returned to the field unharmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday the ground was packed to the rafters with as multiracial a crowd as you are likely to find for a sporting occasion anywhere in Africa.  Kenya is a country with a divided past but, at least where cricket is concerned, a united future. Not so long ago its national side was made up of visiting ex-pats and resident Asians, but since the local African population got involved the game has taken a quantum leap. Steve Tikolo and Maurice Odumbe are Gods to all the ethnic groups, not just the indigenous ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan cricket is celebrating its centenary and, in an unusual move, has applied to the ICC for one-day status instead of full Test status. But with big names like Ali Bacher in support, Kenya can look forward to celebrating Test status, something that would have been inconceivable 10 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bacher heads the ICC committee charged with expanding the game into the 21st century and Kenya is top of the list for his missionary team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the traditionalists who see Test status for Kenya as another dilution of a once great tradition, the future holds many shocks. The ICC has already mooted a kind of world championship of Test cricket; next in line will probably be some kind of second division Test circuit with the likes of Kenya, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Holland fighting it out to join the big boys in the first division, but enjoying full ICC patronage at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This tournament is Kenya's shop window and the three visiting teams have been treated well enough to suggest that the ICC will be pulling into the store sooner rather than later. The hotels have been clean and efficient, so has the transport and the groundstaff have been on their best behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahead of Tuesday's game Pat Symcox was not ridiculed when he suggested that he may take the field in a helmet due to the rough patches on the outfield.  Ironically Symcox fell victim to one of those rough patches, but it was his ankle rather than his head which suffered. And while the surface was far from ideal both sides raised the level of their performance to cope and the only real surprise was that Sri Lanka actually outfielded South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pitch was variable in bounce and offered rather too much turn and the fact that only Daryll Cullinan managed to reach 50 suggested something unfit for international cricket. But what emerged was a game full of character and, latterly at least, much excitement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sri Lankan skipper Arjuna Ranatunga argued that people come to watch batsmen score runs in one-day cricket, but when runs are hard to come by and the bowling is of the quality served up by Allan Donald and Muttiah Muralitheran the result is a spectacle every bit as compelling as a Mark Waugh century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That final is most likely to feature a replay of Tuesday's match with Sri Lanka, hopefully on a more batsman-friendly pitch. South Africa's fighting qualities showed up admirably in a two-wicket defeat and they will take much resolve from that performance in adversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Happily the whispering campaign which accompanied Sri Lanka's World Cup triumph has been silenced here. Despite antipodean rumblings about the lucky Lankans, Ranatunga's men have now won 13 one-day internationals in a row on every kind of pitch on grounds all over the world. As the rotund skipper said on Tuesday, it is nice to keep winning but defeat when it inevitably comes will not erase the fact that they are world champions for at least another three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And South African coach Bob Woolmer has admitted that it will take a string of victories by his side over Sri Lanka to even dispute the title of best one- day side in the world. But beating the islanders comprehensively on Sunday would be a nice way to start.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - 'I used to be ashamed of my crime (kidnapping, possession of firearms and explosives),&quot; says a prisoner in Diepkloof's Medium C section. &quot; Not any more. I've learned to forgive myself. I was an angry person, I grew up in an orphanage. I'm less angry now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prisoner, sentenced to 11 years for his crime, was telling his story during a poetry workshop run by Elaine Rumboll at Diepkloof - the highlight of the week for some inmates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten men, found guilty of crimes ranging from double murder to armed robbery, gathered in a small meeting room with Rumboll as they have done for the past year, to explore a side of themselves most of them hardly knew existed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, six women, there for fraud, robbery and one for murder, did the same thing in a shared cell and small concrete courtyard. And, for the first time, a warden joined in. There's something quite disturbing and moving about watching a warden and a murder prisoner participate in an exercise on trust, each taking turns to be blindfolded and led around the courtyard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked to describe trust in terms of touch, smell, colour, as an object, their language and imagery was astounding. Trust is like water, they said, it moves and flows and changes and its flip-side is jealousy. It's also like a broken cup that's been fixed - you never know how long it will hold or how much it will leak. And it has the sound of a horse galloping at full speed in a race that you've gambled all your money on, they said. So there it is, a poem almost written.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the prisoners stressed that the workshop fulfilled a need for mental stimulation, something sorely lacking inside prison walls, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one put it: &quot;We never had anything like this in the educational system ..  . it's been an opportunity I wouldn't have had outside. It's a pity more people don't come, but they don't all speak English and language is a problem.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added another: &quot;It's something to stimulate your mind. Before, I was an actor, and this provides a space to sensitise and enhance creative ability.  It helps with rehabilitation too. It's not just intellectual, you grow personally and as a human being, you broaden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And another: &quot;It means a lot, it keeps my brain going. Without it, my brain would just die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all sounds great - and believe me, watching the process, it is great - but what will Joe and Jane Public make of it? A lot of people believe the harshness of prison is deserved, part of just punishment for crime. But most insiders come out again - as what? All too often much more hardened and violent than when they went in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In post-apartheid South Africa, we're looking at prisons and prison conditions in a way this country has never done before. There are 120 000 prisoners occupying accommodation for 95 000, according to Gary Friedman of the Puppets in Prison programme, and 450 000 to 500 000 prisoners pass through the jails every year. So, clearly, most are short-term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Department of Correctional Services (DCS) is clearly not the place it used to be. Had anyone tried to take a poetry workshop to prisons 10 years ago, they would have been derided for having &quot;pansy ideas&quot; and had their Communist leanings investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the DCS views the burgeoning creativity programmes as &quot;essential&quot; according to spokesman Russel Mamabolo. Prisoners &quot;are all human beings and the vast majority of them inevitably return to the community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department was thus committed to &quot;expose prisoners as far as possible&quot; to psychological treatment, educational, skills training and recreational programmes. However, funds were a problem and community involvement thus a necessity. The department held the work of volunteers in &quot;high esteem&quot;, he said. &quot;No matter how small or insignificant some projects might sound to some, it all contributes towards equipping the prisoners for a better and crime- free life after imprisonment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carl Niehaus of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services concurred. &quot;These projects are excellent, we need to give our support to them and work at expanding them. Prison doesn't allow for easily expressing emotions and developing skills like painting or drawing help ...  and it's extremely important to get in touch with one's emotions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because most prisoners are short-term, it is crucial they do not come out worse &quot;because that's a waste of taxpayers' money. We do not want to create an even worse criminal. We're not creating a hotel either, but there must be conditions to develop and grow and become better people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's our responsibility, one that we've failed in the past ...  There's a very, very high rate of recidivism in this country. There're not enough programmes and facilities for prisoners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should there be separation of long- and short-term prisoners? &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;there should be diversification but resources are a problem. With over- crowding it's difficult to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, however, there's a growing list. Most of them are one-offs, or short- lived things, but some have managed to sustain themselves over time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiona Lloyd, a community radio trainer recently did two workshops on radio techniques and facilitated the creation of a radio drama. Nontsikelelo Qaba did a workshop on vernacular praise poetry. Musician Matthew van der Want did a workshop on how to write, play and produce songs, &quot;which a delegation from the United States liked so much they took them back to the US prisons&quot;, said Rumboll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicro (National Institute for Crime Prevention and Rehabilitation of Offenders) is right behind the idea as well. &quot;We've got a massive art competition running at the moment,&quot; said spokesperson Rosemary Shapiro, &quot; called Shades of Life, Sorrow and Celebration. Forty prisons participated, with people contributing either sculptures or paintings, and entries have been flowing in.&quot; There are local prizes and a national one of R1 000, the winner to be announced on October 21 in Cape Town at the Breakwater Lodge (once a prison). &quot;They've been expressing sides of themselves they didn't know they had, as well as things the public should know about ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anything that increases humanity and reduces brutality is a good thing and increases the ability to be in society in a constructive way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By tapping into the more feminine (creative) sides of life, one is taking steps to reducing crime ... the first commitment must be to prevent re- offending.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, of course, there's Going Home, The Leeuwkop Male Prisoner's Choir CD released by Gallo. The choir, consisting of prisoners from Pretoria Prison and Leeuwkop, is coached by outsiders Helena van der Merwe and Rikus Burger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, we are behind bars and high walls and our bodies are imprisoned. But through this singing we have freed our minds and souls, and for that I will stay eternally grateful,&quot; commented one of the choir leaders, Coleman Mgogodla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added another, Edward Makgatle: &quot;We have changed our attitudes towards our fellow inmates and warders and towards ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Puppets In Prison, run by Friedman and Nyanga Tshabalala, was initiated when the Department approached them asking for a programme to help combat Aids. The prisoners write their own scripts, make the puppets and act our their own plays. A video of the workshops, in which male prisoners enact a rape, offers shocking, graphic proof of how dehumanising and brutal it can be inside - not to mention fatal, with the Aids infection rate estimated to be between 15 to 30% in prisons, says Friedman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's beside the allegation in the video from some prisoners that warders themselves are sometimes involved in &quot;selling&quot; prisoners to other prisoners. &quot; Warders sell juveniles,&quot; said one. And another: &quot;They smuggle us into the cells of older prisoners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot comment as there were no incidents reported that we are aware of.  If that had happened it would be unlawful and the department would never allow or condone such behaviour,&quot; said DCS spokesman Mamabolo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arepp (African Research and Educational Puppetry Programme) has taken a participatory Aids show, Check Your Mate, to prisons, and is in negotiations over getting workshopped shows going in East Rand prisons next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're involved in something creative, it's rehabilitative,&quot; adds the programme's Brigid Schutz. &quot;A lot of people, especially in prisons, have never had a creative outlet. People just say: 'I never, ever thought I could do this'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prisoners are not in prison forever,&quot; says Rumboll, &quot;and if there're no mechanisms for them to work through why they're there and what they've done, they'll come out more damaged. The system must address these issues ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What then? &quot;I think many of them have accepted responsibility for what they've done, but there's no space to work through the consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is, though, that most programmes are short-term. Longer-term ones, like the poetry workshop, struggle with funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poetry workshop, funded by Arts Alive for the past year, ran out of money this week, but Rumboll is continuing. Puppets In Prison, designed to save lives as well as tap into creative energies, is running into cash problems too, despite the fact that it was commissioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's leave the last word to Hennie Kroukamp, assistant head warder at Diepkloof's Medium C. &quot;There's a big improvement in discipline and creativity.  I hate to admit it, but the poetry workshop is positive,&quot; he says, smiling. &quot; It has a rehabilitative value, in increasing self- respect and caring for each other as well. People have learned to operate in a group. Now they'll share a paintbrush, whereas before they wouldn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Saturday morning it was a case of: Don't call me, I'm recovering from Senegal's Baaba Maal. Everyone who attended his show at Mega Music last Friday night deserves a little medal with the citation: &quot;I endured heat, sweat, crushed toes, squashed ribs and conquered claustrophobia - all for my little Baaba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The place was a crush-bucket.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arts Alive officials said this week they battled to keep angry, insistent people out and had to call security to help them. This, combined with the debacle at the radio launch at the Johannesburg Stadium, indicates there's a simple little phrase - full house - that South Africans just refuse to understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's difficult to judge the music when all you're thinking about is your discomfort. But there were terrifically exotic, oversized costumes and delicious hats, entertaining male dancers, great use of the talking drum and kora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The music varies from serious, slow and complex to more commercial numbers like African Woman. His lyrical French song, Minuit, which departs from tradition to cast midnight as an image of freedom and liberty and which invokes Mandela, brought the house down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He even incorporated a send-up of ye olde European cock-rock, laughing as he held the mike on his pelvis. At least, I think it was a send-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African musicians from Bayete, along with singer Max Mtambo, were brought on for one number. And while it's a nice gesture, it's not what people paid to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phuzekhemisi, the support act, were a stroke of genius. Traditional maskanda, with loads of beads, feathers and dancing - great spectacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need a bigger venue for these acts, something between Mega Music and the Standard Bank Arena. Either that, or more concerts in one venue. In the 1970s Percy Sledge did two or three weeks at downtown Johannesburg theatres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to pay for that, said the spokesman for Arts Alive, we will need a much, much stronger rand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Most African films suffer from the development paradigm: the funding situation gets in the way of true cinematic story- telling. Certainly the line-up of 1996 award-winners reflected such paradoxes. Most of the films were old and several strained under story pressures - based, as they were, on issues and not character. Host nation Zimbabwe scooped six awards - between Flame, the tale of women volunteers during chimurenga and their most recent product, Everyone's Child, about two children orphaned by Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flame picked up best director (Ingrid Sinclair), best actress (Marian Kunonga) and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) prize - recognising a film with a theme that is consistently African. Everyone's Child won for its script (Tsitsi Dangarembga), cinematography (Patrick Lindsell) and music (a compilation of popular Zimbabwean hits). The best film award, however, went to South Africa's Cry the Beloved Country (the best documentary director went to South African Marc Radomsky for Ghetto Flowers), with Cry's Vusi Kunene taking best actor award.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flame has been criticised for being too politically correct. Everyone's Child and another new Zimbabwean feature, I Am the Future, also received flak for being boringly issue-based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder Cry the Beloved Country won the main prize. Funded by, among others, Investec Bank, it displays old-fashioned story-telling and production values, albeit in a Hollywood - or for that matter BMW-commercial idiom - as opposed to the usual well-intentioned, technically inadequate and cinematically stagnant stuff from the region. Of the features, these were the only films that really could have won in what was an unimaginatively programmed festival that also suffered from an inordinate amount of organisational chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian Tumult was a notable exception. Although it's far too long at 117 minutes, its sense of cinematic shorthand is exceptional. The film took six years to make and director Yemane Demissie plugged a bunch of his own money into it, getting very little support from development agencies. And, being the experimental cinematic beast that it is, it probably won't even see the light of a circuit day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In truth, a two-day conference on film financing for regional producers and financiers conducted in French, Portuguese and English was possibly the best attended and most successful element of the festival. Zimbabwe, for example, has had a recent features boom - all because of donor funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To quote Chris Kabwato of Media for Development Trust: &quot;We cannot build commercial cinema because of the nature of the themes prescribed by 'donors' who are quite different from our dreams ... We all know how the Zimbabwean film-maker has become an overnight expert in whatever issue donors place in vogue. Last year it was gender, this year its environment, next year it could be vegetarianism and the next violence to domestic animals ... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is, most African film-makers rely on charities to make their movies. And the attraction of an issue-based story is that it makes for easy distribution through theatres and, more importantly, on video and into universities and community centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone's Child was produced by the Media for Development Trust as part of the Children Under Stress project. It began as a community-based training package aimed at empowering communities to care for children living in hardship, especially those orphaned by Aids. After countrywide research sponsored by Anglo American and Plan International, a story and screenplay were developed. The credits are a fine example of the way African films are being financed these days: the British Overseas Development Administration, PLAN International, the Canadian International Development Agency (Cida), Oxfam-America, Swedish International Development Agency (Sida), Terre des Hommes, and &quot;Jonny's friends from England&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An alternative source of finance is to be found in co-production. The European Union operates a fund simply called APC that gives money to African, Pacific and Caribbean countries. Three member states have to be signatories to a deal for any funds to be handed over. Flame benefited from this scheme and a French-based fund Fond Sud, which specialises in development in the South. There was a lot of debate around the need for co-productions and, above all, government support and tax incentives for the region's film industry. Everyone seemed to agree that lack of finance was the major drawback for African players in the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone agreed except South African producer, Jeremy Nathan: &quot;Money is not the problem because it is there. The stories are the problem. We have to produce interesting stories that attract the viewers.&quot; His company, Catalyst Films, is in the process of producing six half-hour films, a co- production between South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique, Tunisia and Senegal.  Entitled Africa Dreaming, all the films centre on a love story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a total budget of R4 500 000 for three hours of finished product, the major production finance came from La Sept (France, Germany, Austria), YLE TV (Finland), Canal France International and NPS (Holland). The Catalyst project still drew some NGO capital to sustain itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nathan reflects on the project, saying &quot;this continental co-production will show off Africa's talent and establish a reliable network that can serve future productions. Producers are sharing skills, resources and creative approaches from the north and south. Broadcasters should be sharing resources, too, but of the African broadcasters, only the SABC has participated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africans can be encouraged by that, and with the promise of R10- million to support the local film industry included in the government's white paper, we may well be on our way to creating a viable industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwean government is presently preparing a policy document to help boost the local industry, but Sports, Recreation and Culture Secretary Stephen Chifunsiye warned delegates: &quot;When we talk about the film sector, it's a political issue and government will need to know what the political agenda of the films is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the industry in Kenya, Tanzania and Zimbabwe is all but dead.  Only Ghana seems to be thriving, with an output of over 30 feature films a year. But then again, they're all shot on VHS for about R8 000 each - and perhaps there's a lesson in that as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The long and bitter battle by ex-Drum photographer Jurgen Schadeberg to reclaim ownership of his photographs from Jim Bailey, who owned the pioneering African magazine in the Fifties and Sixties, has taken an ominous turn. In the latest round of a conflict which could cause the overhaul of existing copyright legislation, Schadeberg has received abusive phone calls and death threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man with a South African accent phoned three times last week, calling me a nazi and racist, accusing me of having stolen work from black photographers and saying that they were all going to get me,&quot; a visibly traumatised Schadeberg said. &quot;And the caller also hurled abuse at my wife Claudia.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schadeberg does not accuse Bailey of being behind the calls, but photographers countrywide have reacted with outrage to this latest incident.  Schadeberg's photographic contribution and opposition to apartheid is well- documented. Fearlessly, he covered one of the most oppressive eras in South African history, was arrested under suspicion of contravening the Immorality Act after photographing songstress Dolly Rathebe in a bikini, and was frequently the victim of police harassment. He is widely regarded as a living legend, the Alfred Eisenstadt of South Africa, whose tutelage nurtured a new generation of South African photographers: Bob Gosani, Peter Magubane, Gopal Naransamy, Ernest Cole, Alf Khumalo and many others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, letters of support have been pouring in from colleagues such as ex-Drum photographer Ian Berry, journalist Arthur Maimane, Hugh Lewin from the Institute for the Advancement of Journalism (who also worked with Schadeberg on Drum) and ex-Drum editor Sylvester Stein. They have expressed support for Schadeberg's herculean battle to own the photographs he took over 40 years ago. And ultimately, the battle is bigger than either Schadeberg or Bailey; it concerns the right to ownership of intellectual property by every South African journalist and photographer. But it has taken one man to wage it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The abusive calls also follow Schadeberg's acclaimed restrospective running at the National Gallery in Cape Town. On display are photographs from the Drum years in the Fifties, Schadeberg's meanderings through Europe during the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties and works from the Nineties which record the return of former prisoners as new leaders to Robben Island. Shortly after the opening Marie Human from Bailey's archives telephoned the National Gallery, claiming that one of the photographs on display, The Midnight Kids, was in fact taken by Gopal Naransamy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Schadeberg's lawyers, David Dison, Norval and Wheelan, countered the accusation, Human responded that the photograph may or may not have been shot by Naransamy. Naransamy has sent a letter, which is in the possession of the Mail &amp; Guardian, formally confirming that he is not the author of the photograph in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this dispute is merely round ten in a conflict which has seen few punches pulled. It began in 1995 when Schadeberg took Bailey to court for continuing to profit from his photographs. Schadeberg conceded, in terms of South Africa's conservative copyright laws, he had no ownership rights on most of the photographs he took while working for Drum. But, ironically, several photographs appropriated by Bailey's son, the artist Beezy Bailey, for his exhibition in Cape Town and at the Market Gallery during the early Nineties, were personally owned by Schadeberg. And many of the images which Bailey lays claim to were, in fact, shot by Schadeberg after he had left Drum magazine in 1959.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1995 Schadeberg sought an order striking down offending sections of the Copyright Act and restoring ownership to him, as well as the return of all the original photographs and negatives currently in Bailey's possession.  In his court application Schadeberg argued that the constitutional protection of freedom of artistic creativity was being violated by current copyright legislation. According to the Copyright Act, which was only slightly amended from the 1912 legislation, copyright ownership rests not with the author but solely with the employer. This conflicts with international precedent, countries like France and Germany, for example, place ownership firmly in the hands of the photographer who then licenses out his work for a particular time and under specific circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I worked for Drum in the Fifties for about nine years as a photographer/picture editor and was in charge of the photographic department that trained photographers (facts which have been borne out by Berry, Stein and Maimane). During that time I took hundreds of thousands of photographs.  The pay was low, the risks were great, but I did it for Drum as an organisation in the belief that it was worth it because I was capturing an essential slice of history,&quot; recalls the German-born photographer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those pictures belong to Jim Bailey, 40 years later. He still exploits them and sells them around the world without paying a cent to the photographers who took them. If we wish to use our own pictures we are forced to pay him.&quot; He adds: &quot;Bailey has not even paid Bob Gosani's widow one cent for using his work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, when Schadeberg published Sof'town Blues in 1995, he paid each photographer represented in the book a percentage, including Gosani's widow.  Since April, Tilly Gosani has formally authorised Schadeberg to hold her late husband's negatives in his archives and supervise the sale of his work, as well as act on Gosani's behalf in &quot;all transactions relating to my husband's photographs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schadeberg left Drum in 1959 and South Africa in 1964. In 1985, he returned from Europe and voluntarily embarked on the unenviable task of sorting out the Bailey archives. &quot;They were on a farm, in a barn, kept in bashed up cabinets with bits of termite-eaten envelopes. It took me more than six months to sort out tens of thousands of negatives. And Bailey has been profiting from them ever since.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailey has also demanded money from Schadeberg for Drum, a collection of photographs - precursor to Schadeberg's Sof'town Blues - published in Germany during 1991. Schadeberg refused, saying Bailey owed him money and had played a part in the breakdown of negotiations for the book's publication in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an interview on Radio South Africa in January 1995, Bailey accused Schadeberg of &quot;lying continuously&quot;. He was subsequently sued by Schadeberg for defamation. Both matters are in the process of being settled out of court.  But, as the recent incident at the National Gallery suggests, the battle is far from over. &quot;It has become a war of attrition,&quot; says Schadeberg's legal adviser, David Dison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailey refused to be interviewed for this article, or on the issue of copyright legislation, because the case is &quot;sub judice&quot; (Schadeberg refutes this). But in 1995 Bailey went on record to say that &quot;the photographs are not the personal property of anyone. They belong to the whole of South Africa.&quot; Recently the acting chief curator of the Bensusan Photography Museum in Newtown, Hillary Bruce, wrote to Schadeberg asking whether Bailey could be persuaded to give the archives to &quot;the citizens of South Africa&quot; by donating them to &quot;a public body with the facilities and staff to preserve them for the future&quot;. There has also been talk of handing them over to the Mayibuye Centre in Cape Town. But nothing has happened yet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Advertisers are ambivalent about the new Christian satellite network expected to start broadcasting at year end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uplink Broadcasting Limited, a group of about 500 businessmen, has been granted a temporary licence by the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) to broadcast seven digital channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, founded by a ministry, was formally registered as a public company last month, at the same time that the IBA &quot;surprisingly granted us a speedy licence to broadcast&quot;, says Uplink chief executive Craig Kinsman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinsman says the move towards a Christian satellite service was prompted by a concern about the &quot;gratuitous and violent nature of television&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some advertisers, however, fear that the shrinking advertising pie will not be able to accommodate a third satellite network. Others again argue that fragmentation in the broadcasting industry - such as the introduction of a niche market satellite service dedicated to Christians - will bode well for marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt Lascaris media director Lyndall Campher says niche marketing is &quot;good as the industry is moving towards more personalised communication&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Campher argues that the choice of Christian programming as a niche is questionable as it is a small market which advertisers will not keenly pursue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MultiChoice has cornered the market with its 24 digital and three terrestrial channels including its coverage of religious programmes. If Uplink wanted to embark on specialised marketing, a youth service or an Afrikaans target market would have been more appropriate,&quot; argues Campher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Broadcasting Corporation's (SABC) Astrasat service has been a &quot;damp squib&quot;, says Campher, adding that satellite, although a niche market product, has to provide quality programming and an array of choices.  Her concern regarding Uplink's service is that &quot;it is too specialised&quot;, as there is a &quot;limited amount of religious programmes that one can flight&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinsman admits that the audience Uplink is targeting is small - it aims to reach 350- 000 viewers in five years' time, but argues that there will be an abundance of variety available on the satellite service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven channels will include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A family channel with no religious overtones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A Christian channel with a definite religious slant for families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An action channel with &quot;unusual sports&quot; such as tractor and pigeon racing.  The sports will be entertaining and will not feature sports highlights such as rugby, soccer and cricket as M-Net has exclusive rights to all the big matches, says Kinsman. The sports channel, he says, will seek to meet an entertainment criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The fourth channel will broadcast Sky News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* There will be a European channel including Portuguese, Greek and Italian- language programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The sixth will be an interactive education channel where students will be able to phone in to the studio with questions. &quot;This education channel will be different and will aim to assist students, especially failed matriculants, with various subjects by teaching them via television in a cost- effective manner,&quot; Kinsman says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The seventh channel will be a spare channel for mainly business organisations providing various services. &quot;The evening programming on the seventh channel will be dedicated to Afrikaans viewers,&quot; says Kinsman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the the European, education and business channel will have to be subscribed to as extra services; while the other four channels will be received by viewers who install an Uplink decoder and digital satellite system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinsman argues that Hollywood is moving towards a &quot;cleaner image&quot; with 21% of United States film material complying with the criteria of &quot;wholesome television&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinsman says critics of the satellite service should not be under the illusion that there will be no &quot;cuddling&quot; on television because the group is &quot; unable to censor everything&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explains that Uplink executives will be &quot;studying material&quot; - including advertisements - prior to broadcasting programmes. But the exact nature of the panel still needs to be thrashed out, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinsman says it will be necessary to maintain a balance on the panel and have a mix of opinions. Market researchers testing viewers' choices of programmes, combined with input from the group and possibly that of respected religious leaders, will allow for an informed decision to be made regarding the selection of appropriate material for screening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The decision on whether or not to screen a particular film will, therefore, be made by a balanced panel constituting board members and the public. The market will, however, have the most weighted opinion based on research.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertisements, he says are being sold at &quot;a good price&quot; in a bid to entice advertisers to consider using the Christian service as a marketing medium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Saatchi &amp; Saatchi group media director Trish Guilford says this is not enough. She argues that if the satellite is denied an opportunity to advertise on the SABC (because of Astrasat) and on M-Net (because of MultiChoice), the network will be at a disadvantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also, Uplink has to convince me that they will capture a large enough audience for me to want to advertise on their network. But one wonders where they will draw the viewers from,&quot; says Guilford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinsman says he does not regard the Astrasat and MultiChoice as competition as their markets are completely different. &quot;I foresee Uplink existing alongside the other two satellite networks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On expense, Kinsman says that installation costs will be very comparable to analogue prices, although the service will be digital. Somewhere in the range of R1 000, he says. Subscription fees will be about R80 with extra costs for the more specialised channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinsman says the group was vying to link up with a foreign investor and speculation has been rife that a link-up with Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch is on the cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a tight-lipped Kinsman refused to divulge any prominent local or foreign investors, saying that an announcement will soon be made.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The media industry has taken giant steps to greater diversity with the sale of the South African Broadcasting Corporation's (SABC) six regional radio stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) illustrated its commitment to a varied industry when it denied the two major English-language publishing groups, Times Media Limited (TML) and Independent Newspapers, entry into radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent group, with a print monopoly in Durban (it owns The Daily News, The Mercury and Sunday Tribune, among others), lost the bid for East Coast Radio to a consortium which bid R20-million less, despite having linked up with black partners in its Moribo Consortium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, in Cape Town, where it applied for KFM Stereo, the Independent group's R36-million bid was rejected by the regulator as it controls The Cape Argus, Weekend Argus and Cape Times. TML only applied for Radio Algoa in the Eastern Cape, where it owns a large chunk of the print media. It too was turned down.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA's resistance to the &quot;big boys&quot; - even when they linked up with black partners (such as Thebe Investments in the Moribo consortium), has prevented them spreading their dominance in print into broadcasting, and should prevent the emergency of a Rupert Murdoch or Ted Turner multi-media empire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With three new AM and five new FM licences to be awarded at the end of the year, South African broadcasting will be transformed into a diversified industry with a wide variety of choices available to listeners countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A FM format allows for more music and entertainment, while AM allows for specialised broadcasting and talkshows; hence applicants for AM have suggested formats ranging from sports and scientific radio to Afrikaans talk.  According to the IBA Act, no applicant can &quot;control&quot; more than two FM and AM licences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sale of the SABC radio stations, the first completed privatisation effort, will forever change the face of a media industry from one entirely controlled by the apartheid government to one which reflects change in the country and is alive to different cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black media groups are also emerging, such as Kagiso Trust Investments and New Africa Investments Limited (Nail) - the former finalising talks with Afrikaans stable Perskor, the latter a joint owner of the Sowetan (with the Independent) and new owner of TML. A Kagiso-led consortium won two radio licences, East Coast and Radio Oranje, and Nail was part of the group which won Radio Jacaranda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some critics accuse the IBA of double standards as the new black groups' print interests did not block their access into broadcasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as one IBA staffer said: &quot;These critics seem to forget that the previously disadvantaged communities have only in the last two years been allowed entry into the media and pose no threat to major print stables who still own printing and distribution centres and have economic clout and expertise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics also point to Gauteng, where a single player, Primedia, owners of 702 and financier of the consortium which won Radio Highveld, now dominates both regional talk and music radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a large range of new owners and media players, sales and marketing departments will expand, creating more jobs. With heightened competition, newsrooms will grow and radio adspend will increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The faces behind the winning bids</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* KUBEN PILLAY (36) is chairman of Africa on Air, the consortium which successfully placed a R320-million bid for Highveld Stereo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approached by the empowerment partners in the consortium to lead the bid for the broadcast licence, Pillay was responsible for the presentation to the Independent Broadcasting Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pillay is also involved in the Mineworkers Investment Company, one of the black partners in the Primedia consortium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former head of the National Union of Mineworkers' legal department in the mid- Eighties, Pillay left the union in 1988 to become a partner in Cheadle, Thompson &amp; Haysom law firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his capacity as director, Pillay aims to develop policy on skills transfer and play a key role in ensuring that the future ownership of media assets are reflective of the country's diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pillay will also be driving a strategy &quot;where electronic media assets will be placed in the hands of more black South Africans&quot;. The joint control of Highveld Stereo with Primedia has given impetus to the future plans of the black partners, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Primedia again a partner, but in a completely different consortium, an application has been made for an AM licence in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pillay is married with two children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* DELISIWE DLUDLU (38), chairman of Newshelf 71 and a director on the board of New Africa Investments Limited (Nail), secured Radio Jacaranda for R70- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dludlu has a string of degrees behind her name, including a Masters in Management and Clinical Psychology. Her experience in radio includes having hosted a talkshow called Women in Business on SAFM and she has also been a regular guest on various radio shows countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dludlu, a senior lecturer at the University of South Africa (Unisa), runs her own four- year-old consultancy firm where she hones in on corporate strategic planning and human resources development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has also been a principal consultant for Ernst &amp; Young International and is pleased with her involvement in Radio Jacaranda as she feels there is &quot; a lot of potential than can be nurtured&quot; at the radio station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dludlu is unperturbed by the move by Naledi consortium to challenge the IBA's decision on Radio Jacaranda. She said the IBA has assured Newshelf 71 that it will stand by its decision of awarding the licence to Nail despite Naledi's higher bid at R90-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dludlu said Newshelf 71 had no plans to apply for an FM or AM licence. She added that Nail may have formed another consortium in an effort to make an application, but she was unaware of any such plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dludlu is divorced with three children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* TONY MALLAM (33), a chartered accountant by profession, has a passion for radio. He led the Crescent consortium bid for KFM radio (R65-million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mallam previously spent six years as the South African Broadcasting Corporation's financial manager for commercial radio (5FM, Highveld Stereo and Radio Metro) and as the financial manager of Radio Active for two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mallam says he wants to make KFM Stereo the best radio station in the country and will be concentrating heavily on training people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The format of the KFM will be maintained as is, he said, adding that the consortium hopes to contribute towards building the radio broadcasting sector into a booming and healthy industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new board of directors will consist of consortium members with Mallam and Kevin Savage being the only two members who will be actively involved in the day-to-day running, as well as the financial and administrative management, of the radio station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crescent consortium is not applying for an FM or AM licence and will be exerting all its energies into KFM radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mallam is divorced with one son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* ARCHIE NKONYENI (60) is the chairman of Umoya Communications, the consortium which successfully made a bid for Radio Algoa (R10,1-million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkonyeni said the format of Radio Algoa will not change in the short term as the due diligence conducted on the radio station indicated that its current format worked well for listeners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A businessman and twice former national president of the National African Federated Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Nafcoc), Nkonyeni said the board will be taking &quot;a hard look&quot; at what improvements need to take place at Radio Algoa, but as entrepreneurs the consortium will grow all talents currently active within the station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders of Umoya Communications are largely from previously disadvantaged groups and are therefore &quot;alive&quot; to the need for transferring skills, Nkonyeni said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A portion of the budget for Radio Algoa has been set aside to train people.  Plans to link up with Rhodes University's Faculty of Journalism was on the cards for the future, Nkonyeni said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consortium was also aware of gender imbalances and would strive to increase the number of women active in both the newsroom and management areas of the radio station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkonyeni is married with six children and said there are no plans to vie for an AM or FM licence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* FANI TITI (34) is executive director of Kagiso Trust Investment Company, the financial arm of Kagiso Trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titi played a key role in leading the bid for Radio Oranje (R11-million) and East Coast FM (R45-million) on behalf of New Radio Consortium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titi's history in the media has been limited to publishing with an educational slant. A mathematician with degrees from the University of Fort Hare, Wits University and the University of California, Titi says a single board of executives will be established for the two radio stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The format of the stations will not be changed, but expertise will be brought in from the private sector in the areas of financial management, sales and marketing, among others. Current affairs, news and general information will be improved and training will take place on a massive scale - not only in the newsroom but also in management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past two years, Titi has been also involved in talks with Perskor, in a bid for substantial shareholding in the Afrikaans stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KTI has applied for an FM licence in Durban but after acquiring East Coast, the application was withdrawn. However, an application has been made for AM licences in Cape Town and Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Titi is married with one daughter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - Wholesale reform of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) moved a step closer this week as plans were unveiled to give the world financial agency more cash and more power. A British initiative to broaden the IMF mandate, allowing it to police capital flows, won support from financial leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new plan proposed by British Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, the IMF would be given authority to encourage the liberalisation and stability of capital markets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan was unveiled by Clarke in his speech to the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee at which he also endorsed a &quot;modest allocation&quot; of IMF cash to members who have joined since the end of the cold war. This issue caused bitter divisions at the IMF meeting in Madrid two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chancellor's plan for a formal IMF role in capital liberalisation - which won the immediate support of IMF managing director Michel Camdessus - would require a major amendment to the IMF's articles of association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK believes this could be done in tandem with the capital increase required to improve the IMF's liquidity. The IMF would like to see its resources doubled to nearly $400-billion, although a somewhat lower figure is likely to be arrived at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IMF's existing articles focus on meeting difficulties arising from the current account of the balance of payments. With the increasing openness of capital markets, Clarke argues that the IMF should be given an explicit mission to encourage further liberalisation. Under the present articles, some nations are positively encouraged to impose capital controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the leading industrial countries believe there is a need to balance new freedoms in the global financial markets with strengthened bank supervision and financial regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States treasury secretary Robert Rubin argued that &quot;co-operation among financial regulators and supervisors and internal controls and market transparency&quot; were needed - as well as better ways of monitoring the financial systems in emerging markets and electronic money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In respect of the process of broadening the IMF's authority over capital markets, Clarke emphasised the need for countries to manage their economies differently. He told the IMF policy-makers that national markets need to be well supervised and regulated so that they can cope with large capital inflows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, these inflows should not be allowed to &quot;fuel excessive domestic demand&quot; or be allowed to substitute for domestic savings. The G10 group of industrial countries, with an 11th, Switzerland, as an honorary member - agreed to a doubling of the IMF's borrowing resources to $50- billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be done by raising funds for use in emergencies, the New Arrangements to Borrow, from a larger number of countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - We are constantly told how globalisation has shifted the balance of economic power towards multinational corporations at the expense of practically everyone else. Yet in the most exciting area of the world economy - the explosive growth of the Internet - the opposite is happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multinationals are being taken to the cleaners and, so far, can't do much about it. There is a &quot;socialist&quot; strain in the Net which deserves much more study by labour strategists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Internet is a worldwide network of computers which can be searched from any home computer linked to a telephone. It enables users to do a dizzy variety of things ranging from browsing online through thousands of databases including newspapers, to downloading video clips or audio records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's amazingly cheap for what it offers - costing a small monthly fee plus telephone charges - and will get even cheaper as the new generation of network computers slashes the capital charge of getting online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Net is already its own state with its own rules and its own economy. It will soon have its own money too. But instead of being an electronic island remote from the rest of the world, it is starting to change the way the world economy operates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While everywhere else is still operating a post-Thatcherite philosophy in which everything has to be paid for at a commercial rate, the Net's content has become an electronic free lunch. Even Microsoft, one of the richest companies in the world, has been forced to give away its Internet browsing software free - not least because its chief rival, Netscape, has already parted with most of its 40-million browsers for nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highly impressive &quot;search engines&quot;, enabling people to search the world's databases in seconds, are also free - as are most of the proliferating journals. Last week a senior Microsoft executive lamented that the company couldn't charge for its online journal, Slate, because of a million other things punters can get gratis, at the click of a button.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporations can still charge for offline products like motor cars or sofas sold online. But even here the Net's potential power is asserting itself. In the United States, consumers wanting the same product are contacting each other through the Net to negotiate bulk discounts, cutting out the middle man if they can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This gives another push to technological deflation, which is giving customers improved products at a lower real cost. And this is not picked up by national inflation statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrival of recruitment adverts on the Net is also starting to have macro-economic effects. Someone in New York can now search through all available ads to find, say, a job in California that he wouldn't otherwise have heard of - thereby making US labour markets even more flexible than they are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question that used to be asked about the information highway was: &quot;Ah, but where are the killer applications to utilise the huge capacity made possible by optical fibres, one strand of which can carry an entire nation's phone calls?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not any more. The Internet has become the information superhighway and the products it has already generated are threatening to overwhelm its capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we haven't seen anything yet. The Internet can connect any computer or television screen to anywhere in the world which has a database, a live camera or a similar computer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the films we watch, the telephone calls we make and banking transactions will probably happen through the Net soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These wonders fall short of creating a digital Utopia because they are not universally accessible. The people who would most benefit proportionately from cheap access - the poor, the deprived and the Third World - can't afford to pay up to $1 500 or more to get online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will change only after the resolution of the new Cyberspace trade war that is about to break out. Dozens of companies are battling to build cheap &quot; boxes&quot; to provide links with the Net and easily useable software to use the facilities. Netscape and Microsoft are fighting each other for the biggest prize of all - the browser software that governs navigation of the Net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governments are relegated to the sidelines in this war ... except in two important respects. As legislators they can alter the direction of battle, as the British and US authorities did when they deregulated the telecoms markets, and as facilitators they can influence the speed at which the technology spreads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Conservatives' decision to put computers in every school during the early 1980s helped to raise computer literacy in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A comparable plan to help every home to have cheap Internet Access would be the information equivalent of setting up a National Health Service. Any offers?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Banks and other financial institutions could soon be expected to play a more active role in cracking down on money laundering in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although no hard statistics are available about the extent of the problem, Justice Minister Dullah Omar warned delegates at a conference in Cape Town this week that nobody should under-estimate the danger presented by the rapid growth of money laundering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a danger that should be taken very seriously by all countries,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Countries that fail to take action against it face not only massive potential financial losses, but a terrible threat to the entire fabric of society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a study by the South African Law Commission, money laundering can be defined as &quot;the manipulation of illegally acquired wealth in order to obscure its true source or nature. This is achieved by performing a number of transactions with the proceeds of criminal activities that, if successful, will leave the illegally derived proceeds appearing as the product of legitimate investments or transactions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar had a simpler and more direct definition. Money laundering, he said, involved &quot;the hiding of money, that is, the salting of illicit income in different banks or real estate investments, and the cleaning of money which involves concealing the source of money in various ways.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem with cracking down on money laundering was that it was done by &quot; invisible&quot; people using the latest high- tech computer programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This resulted in a &quot;cash anonymity&quot; that funded criminal activities with ease, often allowing individuals to set up business in unfair competition with legal activities, avoid tax and generally spend their ill- gotten gains as and when they wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money laundering is a fairly new phenomenon in South Africa. Omar said now that South Africa was an open society, &quot;the super gangsters have identified (the country) as a fresh and innocent market for money laundering and international crime&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were aided in this by the &quot;pervasive and almost obsessive secrecy&quot; built up in South Africa by covert government operations under apartheid, which had spilled over into the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Corruption and dishonesty became a daily feature of South African political and economic life,&quot; Omar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, many South Africans hid their sources of income and did things &quot;off the book&quot;, sometimes with the aim of transferring their money out of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money laundering also promoted the growth of a secondary &quot;underground&quot; economy, debilitated the financial sector and perverted business morality, Omar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every effort therefore had to be taken to &quot;collectively combat this scourge&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the South African Law Commission had recommended that financial institutions should be forced to keep effective records on all clients and possible dubious transactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also recommended the establishment of a central financial intelligence unit to keep track of such transactions. Parliament is currently examining legislation to enforce this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference, which is being sponsored by the Commonwealth Secretariat, brings together delegates from various Commonwealth countries for the first in-depth examination of money laundering in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commonwealth Secretariat head Dianne Stafford said most of the conference would be held behind closed doors so that delegates could be totally frank about the extent of the problem and the best ways of combating it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretary of the Commonwealth's financial action task force Patrick Moulette said it was vital that all countries adopted strict regulatory regimes to monitor money laundering and ensure it was eliminated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Heavily taxed at home, South Africa's wine producers are increasingly concerned about illegal imports and exports of spirits, which could be costing the country about R9-billion a year in lost revenue, according to some estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stellenbosch Farmers Winery (SFW) chairman Jeff Malherbe said in his annual report this week that this amount was more than &quot;three times the country's current budget for the Reconstruction and Development Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Business looks to the government to create a stable environment with clear regulating policies within which sustainable economic development can take place. It is, therefore, gratifying to note the steps taken by business and the government to curtail this illegal action.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was referring to the new Customs Law Enforcement Group Caucus, set up over the past year by business and the government. But he was less happy about developments on excise duty and import tariffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the liquor industry had always made &quot;a substantial contribution&quot; to the fiscus through company taxes and excise duty, but was this year once again hit by &quot;excessive&quot; excise duty increases for wines and alcoholic fruit beverages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his annual report, Distillers chairman Boet van Zyl said that of the cash value added by his group, 45% was used to pay excise duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;High levels of excise duties are detrimental to all interest groups and increases ... should be limited to below the increase in the producer price index to avoid upward pressure on inflation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SFW imports whisky and Malherbe said he was concerned about the delay in finalising import tariffs in terms of obligations under the World Trade Organisation. This was creating uncertainty, which affected long-term planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the free trade agreement being negotiated with the European Union, Malherbe said that while SFW supported the principles of international free trade, &quot;the agreement should be carefully negotiated in order to avoid unnecessary disruption of the local industry and resultant job losses&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Zyl said the import tariffs on wine and spirits should be set in such a way &quot;to prevent the dumping of subsidised foreign products in the South African market, without disrupting the market for normally priced imported products&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SFW said its export sales had grown by 38% in volume over the last year and were expected to show continued growth. &quot;In order to meet this expected increase, SFW will assess the potential of joint ventures with international partners,&quot; SFW managing director Frans Stroebel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said SFW was now exporting to 50 countries, with Germany the largest market. Exports to Africa had grown &quot;significantly&quot;, mainly to Kenya and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Distillers' managing director Jan Scannell said exports had risen 22% in volume and 46% in value to R84-million in the past year and this was expected to be maintained in the coming year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To meet overall increased demand, Distillers had approved projects worth R47-million in the coming year, mainly to improve efficiency and quality assurance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is late evening, and Johannesburg is a city under siege.  Forty-four Main Street, headquarters of the Oppenheimer mining and industrial empire - on some measures the greatest commercial concern on earth - was once the juiciest target on the nationalisation hit-list of Nelson Mandela's liberationists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now its top brass have the uncomfortable feeling that they may have beaten off nationalisation only to face a different threat - criminalisation. Thirty percent of all goods landed at Durban's port are disappearing; modern South Africa's economy is being nationalised de facto by gangsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of miles to the north-west, De Beers, the world's biggest diamond mining company and the jewel in the Oppenheimer crown, faces troubles of a different sort in Angola, the world's fourth (or possibly third) biggest diamond producer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While United States peacemakers try to persuade once-warring factions to break bread, every chancer in the world seems to have descended on the country to make his fortune. Diamond claims are grabbed by those who have &quot; established stability&quot; in the local area; millions of dollars of diamonds are salted out of the country and end up on world markets without passing through De Beers's worldwide marketing cartel. Every unauthorised diamond sale weakens the price of gemstones everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile 7 680km away, it is midnight in Moscow, capital of the world's second- biggest diamond producer, and a team from De Beers is unwinding after another gruelling day of negotiations with Almazy Rossii-Sakha, the Russian gemstone monolith. A deal was supposed to have been signed at the start of the year to keep Russia's gems inside the De Beers marketing cartel, but the devil is proving to reside in the detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smuggling and leakages out of Russia undermine the cartel from below, while gung- ho nationalist politicians, their grasp of economics shaky to say the least, toy with the idea of rejecting the irksome disciplines of the De Beers monopoly and going it alone. Life, veterans will sigh, was so much easier when Soviet statesmen could be relied upon publicly to denounce De Beers as capitalist lackeys of the racist Boer hyenas, while privately ensuring the closest co-operation between the USSR's diamond industry and the chaps from Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain, it is 10pm, and millions have just watched the latest episode of a BBC costume-drama spectacular in which Martin Shaw plays De Beers's founding father, Cecil John Rhodes. The more avid viewers will have included personnel from the Central Selling Organisation (CSO) in Hatton Garden, the hub of the diamond cartel. With problems crowding in on De Beers from all corners of the world, the guilty thought may occur: where is he now we really need him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To which the reply may well be that Rhodes, or at least his spirit, is now working for the other side. The Angolan garimpeiros dodging the law to dig diamonds, the brash Australians who this year declared independence and walked out of the cartel, even (or perhaps, especially) the Russian nationalists with their slightly-cracked dreams of a special Russian destiny - all could be seen as more Rhodes-ian than the super-respectable global giant that is the modern De Beers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Angola, for example, De Beers recently found itself hopelessly out- Rhodesed by a Brazilian outfit: De Beers wanted to talk about long-term investment, while the boys from Brazil promptly offered the president's wife a seat on the board. Cecil would have been proud - of the Brazilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Rhodes would have deplored the anarchy now threatening the world diamond industry. He knew better than anyone that diamonds are worth nothing without the artificial rarity only a cartel can provide. Or, as CSO chairman Nicky Oppenheimer has put it: &quot;Diamonds do not make engines run faster or planes fly further or higher. Unique among major raw materials, the gem diamond has no material use to material man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take away the strict discipline of the cartel, flood the market with diamonds and within a very short space of time these &quot;gems&quot; will be worth no more than any other coloured stone. And De Beers, through its own mines the world's top producer, has long been willing to run the cartel on behalf of its fellow miners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Rhodes, during the great African diamond rush of the 19th century, was among the first to understand that the mechanised mining of diamonds, which he had pioneered, was pulling stones out of the ground at a rate incompatible with &quot;rarity&quot; status. Central control of supply was essential to the manipulation of demand. No wonder Rhodes's heirs were to find it so congenial to do business in Moscow with the ideological descendants of Marx and Lenin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the vision of a global diamond syndicate was finally realised not by the freebooting Rhodes, but by a German-born Jewish Londoner sometime of South Africa via Maidenhead, Sir Ernest Oppenheimer. A legendary figure of astonishing determination, Oppenheimer practically stopped the post-Great War diamond crash single-handed. Rhodes's rudimentary cartel broke down during the savage inter-war depression and gem prices collapsed. Oppenheimer, chairman and managing director of De Beers, more or less offered to buy all the diamonds in the world in order to support the price, an extraordinary gamble that paid off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1934, he put together the modern cartel; his diamond syndicate, with its 10 &quot;sights&quot;, or sales, a year in the CSO's Hatton Garden building, today markets perhaps 80% of all the world's diamonds. Nearly $5 billion-worth of stones are traded through the CSO every year, all of them to approved diamond brokers vetted by De Beers. The first hint of a broker going off-side - dealing with smugglers or (the really heinous crime) attempting to build up his own stock of diamonds - and he will find himself unwelcome at the CSO's Charterhouse Street complex. For unwelcome, read out in the cold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This blend of ruthlessness and paternalism has kept the diamond business surviving and thriving through a world war, a cold war, the long boom and the recessionary crises of the past 15 years. But the chaos of the new world &quot; order&quot; faces De Beers with challenges of a greater magnitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bucking the cartel seems flavour of the decade, from Australia - where Argyle, the world's largest diamond mine in volume if not in quality - walked out of the CSO this year, to frozen north-west Canada, whence diamonds are due to come on stream at the turn of the century and will probably by-pass the syndicate. In both cases, Britain's RTZ mining group - a company as grand in its way as De Beers - is involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rumour suggests RTZ may be planning an alternative to the CSO to market Australian, Canadian and Russian stones, although how two &quot;monopolies&quot; would work is anyone's guess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, where RTZ leads, smaller fry are following. Recently, just yards from the CSO building, Hatton Garden dealers have been offered diamonds from Brazil, diamonds originating almost certainly in Angola - supposedly a CSO member. The Brazilians, exploiting their common language with ex- Portuguese Angola, are becoming formidable players in south-west Africa. Black-market &quot; pavement&quot; deals such as this mock the mighty CSO cartel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far more serious is the flood of diamonds out of Russia to Antwerp and Tel Aviv; smuggling and other &quot;leakages&quot; peaked at about o41-million a month during 1993 and 1994, but dropped to about o8-million earlier this year after the outline deal with De Beers was signed. By mid-year, however, unauthorised sales surged again to about o33-million, not a good augury for the detailed talks under way in Moscow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The smuggling routes - Angola through Zaire to Europe or Israel, Moscow through Antwerp and Tel Aviv - are well-marked, and it is hardly surprising that Russian gangsters have been diving into bed with the long- established Antwerp diamond mafia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smuggling on this scale will, if it continues, eventually break the cartel.  De Beers is pledged to mop up surplus stones on the open market to support the price, and use these stocks to smooth prices in the future. This was the system devised by Sir Ernest Oppenheimer. But the point would have to come when even the Oppenheimer coffers would be exhausted. And at that point, the entire diamond industry - will collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other price cartels can fall apart without taking the commodity down with them. Motorists still need petrol and factories still need oil. But diamonds are not a commodity; they are worth what they are worth because the CSO says that is what they are worth. And that applies not only to new stones, but to all diamonds everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paradoxically, it may be this prospect of mutually assured destruction that will bring the worldwide industry to heel. Given that there has to be a cartel, it may as well be run by the people who invented it. And at Stockdale Street, in Kimberley, where it all began, older hands at De Beers's office will recall seeing and hearing it all before: when Sierra Leone went &quot;rogue&quot; 40 years ago, when opals threatened diamonds' prominence before the World War I, when the world quarantined white South Africa in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, should it not prove all right on the night, De Beers executives can always cheer themselves with a glass of Boschendal 1992, a splendid red wine produced at a company-owned vineyard, part of Rhodes Fruit Farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cecil John, whatever his faults, provided for every eventuality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Business and labour are worried that the new Labour Relations Act (LRA) could trip up before it even gets off the starting blocks on November 11. Its success hinges on whether the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) will be able to effectively hold together the fabric of the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission is integral to the new labour law and the stakeholders fear it may not have the ability and resources to fulfill its intended obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, Labour Minister Tito Mboweni has come under increasing criticism for the many delays and amendments to the Act.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chamber of Mines industrial relations adviser Adrian Du Plessis says the successful discharge of the commission's role is fundamentally essential to the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LRA will usher in a new labour dispensation, together with a set of major new institutions, systems and procedures. And the commission, led by Charles Nupen, is a key independent statutory institution in this system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reservations are, however, being expressed that the newly trained commissioners may not have the experience to handle the sheer volume and complexities of labour disputes referred to the CCMA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern has also been raised over whether the commission will be able to perform effectively given its budgetary constraints. Business and labour are adopting a cautiously optimistic view, but stress the eventual success of the LRA will rest on whether the CCMA will be able to effectively deliver a speedy mediation and arbitration service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stated objectives of the CCMA are to prevent labour disputes from arising and to settle disputes that do arise by conciliation and arbitration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CCMA is expected to handle as many as 30 000 cases a year, with a staff of 435, including 91 full-time commissioners. It has been allocated a budget of R93,4-million for the financial year to end-March 1997, of which 43% (R39, 9-million) will be devoted to salaries and wages. Senior commissioners will receive an annual package of R239 000, while junior commissioners will receive R120 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, says Jayendra Naidoo, National Economic Development and Labour Council executive director, the initial size of the CCMA may be too ambitious. He was worried over whether the commission would be able to handle the administration of such a large workforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of labour affairs at the South African Chamber of Business (Sacob), Gerrie Bezuidenhout, said it had publicly stated its concerns about the level of expertise of the newly trained commissioners; a concern echoed by Steve Lenahan, industrial relations consultant for the Anglo American Gold Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do have a serious concern about the design of the commission, given the budgetary constraints and the number and quality of commissioners,&quot; Lenahan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry analysts point out that should the CCMA fail it will place a considerable strain on the effective working of the new Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nupen agrees that a number of commissioners have minimal experience in dispute resolutions. He does not feel, however, that this should affect the overall running of the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The full-time commissioners will be complemented by access to a body of part- time commissioners with extensive experience in dispute resolution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only way his commissioners will be able to gain experience, he says, is through day- to-day exposure to the conciliation and arbitration process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are internal devices to decide on the complexity of each individual case and the appropriate commissioner will then be assigned,&quot; Nupen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He conceded that there will be some initial mistakes and some understandable teething problems. &quot;The institution is in the process of development. That process will take many months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission has set a target success rate of 50% or higher in the conciliation process - a significant increase on the present estimated 12% success rate achieved by the Industrial Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bezuidenhout says Sacob expects the larger institutions to retain their own private arbitrators and industry dispute mechanisms already in existence. The statute recognises private agreements and bargaining councils and sanctions the use of private agencies and dispute resolution procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bulk of businesses and labour will, though, rely on the CCMA, especially smaller businesses,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naidoo said industry stakeholders should not expect the first few months to be rosy. He feels it will take at least one or two years before the commission will be running effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One has to set a modest and pragmatic measure of success or failure. The function of the commission is to facilitate in disputes. They cannot guarantee success, that will be in the hands of the parties involved,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nupen is expecting his commissioners to handle up to two conciliations per day. &quot;We do not have the luxury of time that private agencies have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harold Harvey, deputy secretary-general of the Transport and General Workers Union, added his concern over whether the heavy workload on staff will affect the quality of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The commission should expect a period where there will be a lot of headbutting against the Act from the shopfloor,&quot; Harvey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Nupen says he will only be able to assess the capacity of the CCMA once it opens its doors. &quot;Maybe in the medium term we will have to develop our human resource capacity, depending on the volume we have to handle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Between 1 and 7 August, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in Sudan, Dr Gaspar Biro, made his first visit to the country for three years. The regime finally conceded to international pressure and permitted Dr Biro to visit Khartoum. However, the regime's propaganda machine immediately sought to distort the visit for its own purposes but found itself stonewalled by Dr Biro's determination to keep to the main issues and not be side-tracked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last April, at the annual meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime finally relented and agreed to a visit by Dr Biro at a later date. Up until then, the regime had insisted that Dr Biro had insulted the Islamic religion in his earlier report on human rights in Sudan and would not be allowed back until he apologised for his comments. In reality, the special rapporteur's report had merely concluded that provisions within the regime's Criminal Act of 1991 were inconsistent with the provisions of international conventions to which Sudan is a party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, recognising that a compromise of some sort was necessary to break the deadlock, Dr Biro made a public statement in which he said that he did not mean the remarks in the report as an insult to Islam. In fact, he went even further and said that he had every respect for Islam as a religion. The regime took his statement to be an apology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finds No Change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Be that as it may, Dr Biro found little change in the human rights situation inside Sudan and Khartoum's attitude and behaviour towards him.  Once again, the special rapporteur was neither looking for a confrontation with the regime nor investigating any particular human rights abuse, although he did receive evidence from many people within and outside of Sudan which will undoubtedly end up in his final report to be presented to the next session of the UN General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whilst in Khartoum, Dr Biro was closely watched by the security forces and the regime's media. Most of the people who accompanied him around town were security agents. Security agents also masqueraded as people working on human rights issues. The media wished to know Dr Biro's opinion on the issue of slavery. The special rapporteur refused to make any comments, yet that did not prevent the press from publishing a report on the day of Dr Biro's departure that he had said there was no slavery in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being made aware of the slant that the Khartoum regime had placed upon his visit and wishing to counter the false comments attributed to him, Dr Biro gave an interview to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) World Service. He told the interviewer that in many cases the human rights situation in Sudan has worsened over the three years. Issuing a formal statement to the international media for Geneva on 9 August, the Human Rights Centre said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prof. Gaspar Biro, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights in Sudan has completed his fourth mission to the north African country. He was in Khartoum from August 1 to August 7. Professor Biro was appointed Special Rapporteur in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Professor Biro says that reports in the Sudanese media have grossly misrepresented his views on the human rights situation in Sudan. These reports have also been cited by news services. Professor Biro notes that he gave no interviews and made no statements to the media during his mission to Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On 2 August, at the beginning of his visit, a Sudanese newspaper said that Professor Biro's report on Sudan described the country's Islamic Sharia laws as 'brutal and inhumane'. No such language has been used the Special Rapporteur in any of his six reports on the human rights situation in Sudan.  Professor Biro's 1994 report notes that several provisions of Sudan's Criminal Act of 1991 are 'inconsistent with the provisions of international conventions to which Sudan is a party'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On 7 August, there was a newspaper report citing the state owned 'Al-Sudan Al-Hadith' which quotes Professor Biro as saying 'there was no existence of practices of slavery in Sudan'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Again - the Special Rapporteur said nothing of the kind. For the past three years he has consistently reported on slavery, servitude, forced labor and similar practice taking place in several parts of Sudan perpetrated by some members of the Sudan army and paramilitary groups fighting with the government in Southern Sudan. Reports on such practices continue to be received by the Special Rapporteur - including during his mission to Khartoum this month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others Invited</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps hoping to receive more favourable reports than that of Dr Biro, the NIF regime has also arranged for visits from two other UN special rapporteurs.  During September, Khartoum will be visited by Mr Abid Hussain, who is a special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, and also by Mr Abdelfatah Amor, special rapporteur on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance and discrimination. Both men are Moslem and come from India and Tunisia respectively. The NIF regime is basing its hopes for more favourable reports upon the religious affinity it believes it will be able to establish with the two men. However, it is unlikely that professional men such as the two rapporteurs will allow themselves to be preyed upon in this way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already the two special rapporteurs have side-stepped one of Khartoum's attempts to use them to undermine Dr Biro. The regime tried to arrange for the men to visit Sudan prior to Dr Biro. Sensing that the regime might use their visit as a pretext for not inviting Dr Biro to visit afterwards, Mr Amor and Mr Hussain deliberately slowed down arrangements for their own visits, so that Dr Biro would already have visited</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is often the case in Sudan, the itinerary for the visit of Mr Amor has proved problematic. Originally, it had been intended to allow him to visit the Nuba Mountains. That visit has now been struck off his itinerary. The regime was concerned that it would be unable to completely stage manage such a visit given that area is a prime example of the religious intolerance and discrimination practiced by the regime. The Popular Defence Forces (PDF) have victimised all of the Nuba people, be they Moslem or Christian. Mosques in the area have been burnt down as well as Christian churches. This has been a key element in the regime's jihad to eradicate Nuba culture. The Islam practiced by the Nuba people is of a different style to that demanded by the Islamic Fundamentalists in Khartoum. Whilst the special rapporteur on an official visit would be unlikely to witness any evidence of such crimes, he would pick up the atmosphere and environment in which the crimes are committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first time that the regime has toyed with the idea of allowing a foreign dignitary to visit the Nuba Mountains. Last year, when the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, visited Khartoum, he had planned to visit the Nuba Mountains. This visit was dropped from the itinerary at the last moment without any explanation given by the regime. For many years now, the Nuba Mountains has been a closed area for foreign visitors to Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Beleaguered and attacked from all sides, the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime last month engaged in many desperate attempts to escape from its problems. Internally, the much heralded 10 April Charter and its false promises of a &quot;peace from within&quot;, was rapidly degenerating into an expensive farce. Not even the customary announcement of a thwarted coup d'etat on 13 August and the reported execution of eleven army officers, could bring any respite for the regime. Demonstrations and protests continued in the major cities of the North, despite the arrest and detention of political leaders. Chronic inflation continued to undermine any value still left to the Sudanese pound. On top of all this, the regime's external isolation continued apace with the threatened imposition of further sanctions by the United Nations Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than sixty army officers were arrested in eastern Sudan for voicing their criticism of the regime and its policies. They had apparently suggested that their loyalty lay with the state rather than with any narrow based political party such as the NIF, and called for an end to the civil war and for the restoration of good relations with Sudan's neighbours. As a result of their outspoken comments, the officers have been charged with supporting the opposition National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and of plotting a coup d'etat.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">External Factors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday 16 August, the UN Security Council announced that air sanctions would be imposed upon Sudan in November unless the regime carried out the requirements of resolution 1055. Sudan Airways will be grounded and the regime's last lifeline with the outside world severed. The regime's response was for both Lieutenant General El Beshir and his mentor, NIF leader Dr Hassan Abdalla El Turabi, to plead with the United States of America to open a dialogue with them. They feigned ignorance of exactly what the USA wanted them to do. Essentially, all of the requirements are clearly set down in resolutions 1044 and 1055: the three terrorist suspects in the assassination attempt on Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak should be handed over to Ethiopia; the training camps for international terrorists should be closed down and the foreign terrorists expelled from Sudan; and the regime should stop destabilising the neighbouring states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inference on Human Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NIF regime has been condemned for human rights abuses at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva for the past four years and a special rapporteur has been appointed. The sanctions issue cannot be viewed in isolation from the General Assembly's annual votes to endorse the recommendations of the Human Rights Commission. There is the distinct possibility that, one day, members of the regime will be held accountable for the war crimes that they have committed over the past seven years. If the Sudanese civil war had received the same media attention devoted to Bosnia, Rwanda and Burundi, these horrendous war crimes, also amounting to genocide, would be far more widely known in the international community and less easy to ignore.  Fortunately, international human rights organisations such as Christian Solidarity International, who have regularly visited Sudan and documented atrocities there, are now making themselves heard in the media and the NIF regime is finding the increase in negative publicity far more difficult to counter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regime's charm offensive has failed to gain support in the US administration. The regime's latest ambassador to Washington, Mahdi Ibrahim, has singularly failed to convince anyone with his comments in the Washington Times last month that Sudan was &quot; a blossoming democracy that coveted warm and amicable relations with the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mahdi is so anxious to win over the Americans that he issued a generous letter of invitation to over twenty-five members of the US Congress to visit Sudan and witness the conditions there for themselves. Unfortunately, in his political naivete he overlooked the fact that in an election year these same members of Congress would be tied up in campaigning until the elections in November. Senator Diane Feinstein of California, who is a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, summed it up when, thorough her aide, she let it be known that she will not find time in her schedule to visit Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Internal Front</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) were arrested en masse inside the country, but this failed to quell the protests in Khartoum and Wad Medani. Lecturers at the University of Khartoum issued a memorandum calling upon the regime to stand down immediately and accusing it of mismanagement at home and abasement of the country abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The position of a university lecturer was once much sought after and in 1989 only twenty-three posts remained unfilled. Today, at least 300 posts are now empty and much of the blame for this lies with the chronic inflation and the high cost of living. A lecturer's salary is no longer prestigious and individuals have had to look elsewhere to make ends meet. Take one example: on 13 August the Sudanese pound was quoted at SL1,820 to the US dollar and on 15 August it was quoted at SL2,100 pounds to the dollar. A lecturer's salary has increased from SL3,000 per month in 1989 to SL45,000 today, which may seem a significant increase until placed within its true context. It is equivalent to just over twenty-one US dollars! Another example of the high cost of living is petrol, which has now soared to over SL3,000 per gallon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minimum Wage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade Union officials have demanded that the minimum wage be increased from SL15,000 Sudanese pounds to SL27,000 per month. The regime has rejected this demand bringing the threat of a general strike that much closer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regime's own institutions are also feeling the pinch from the high cost of living. Members of the regime's sham parliament have requested a monthly salary of SL400,000 Sudanese pounds. The speaker of the assembly, Dr Hassan El Turabi, has suggested that members should receive SL100,000 per month and a further SL72,000 in expenses. That would give the members SL36,000 more per month than cabinet ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The War Fronts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavy seasonal rains have made rapid military gains impossible on the battlefields of the South and fear of the unknown has brought about a degeneration of morale amongst the regime's troops</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whilst Colonel John Garang, leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) was visiting troops in the Kaya, Kajokeji and Morobo areas of Equatoria last month, members of the NIF regime's Popular Defence Forces (PDF) walked out of the bush and surrendered to the SPLA. This was a clear indication of the low morale among Khartoum's forces as they wait besieged in the garrisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In eastern and south-eastern Sudan, the forces of the Beja Congress and other NDA groups are slowly making an impression upon the regime and causing real concern in Khartoum. In the east, commando raids have disrupted communications along the railway and road links between the capital and Port Sudan. In the Ingessina Hills, the SPLA forces of Commander Malik Agar have continued to hold Khor Yabous and the surrounding area, thus providing a constant threat to the capital's power supply at Damazin and Rosseires in the Blue Nile province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Nuba Mountains, the local SPLA units have managed to overcome supply difficulties and have held onto their positions despite repeated offensives by Khartoum's forces. Much of the guerrilla army's supplies have come from successful ambushes on the regime's forces. Unfortunately, the regime continues to aerially bombard civilian targets with planes based in El Obeid and these bombing raids have been far more difficult to counter. These planes can carry far more bombs when making the short return to the Nuba Mountains than they can when making raids upon the more distant South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Charter Factor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 10 April Charter has not made any impact upon the battlefields of the South. Whilst Khartoum has succeeded in engendering rivalry amongst the signatories, this has not been translated into creating fighting forces capable of confronting the SPLA. The Charter has failed to win support from the Southern population who, quite rightly, have equated it with surrender to the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the charter was first signed, the renegade commander, Kerubino Kuanyin Bol, was designated leader of the so-called Bahr El Ghazal group of the SPLA, a move designed to remind Riek Machar and his Southern Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM) that he was just one of several leaders in the South. The move was also designed to show the world that the Dinka people were split into two camps: those who support Colonel Garang and those who support Kerubino. Certainly, the regime has prevented Riek Machar from negotiating with them as the voice of the South, but it has not succeeded in setting up Kerubino as the undisputed power in Bahr El Ghazal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, another signatory to the charter, Commander Arok Thon Arok, finally travelled to Khartoum from Kenya. The regime's mouthpiece, Radio Omdurman, announced two days later that Commander Arok's supporters among the Bor Dinka community in Nairobi have organised the formation of an SPLA group in Upper Nile. Commander Arok, perhaps sensing his powerlessness in Khartoum, has yet to respond to that announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commander Machar has also found out that his position within the regime is far from secure. He had to play second billing to vice president George Kongor Arop during a recent tour of Northern Sudan. The vice president is a Southerner who has co-operated with the regime from the outset. At a rally in Abu Hamed, Riek Machar, speaking first, spoke about his request for Self- determination for the South, even though the 10 April Charter is at best ambiguous on this point. He was followed by George Kongor who took the opportunity to put the renegade commander in his place, saying that ideas of Self-determination should remain in the bushes of Southern Sudan. Sudan should stay a united country and will never be divided up. Quite understandably, George Kongor's speech received a more generous welcome than that of the renegade commander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Kongor is well aware that his position within the NIF regime is under threat from Mr Machar. He knows that the position of vice president could one day be linked to the chairmanship of the proposed Council for the South which the 10 April Charter was supposed to lead to. He has no intention of letting Mr Machar undermine his position within the regime</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whilst the regime has now successfully created power struggles between commanders Machar, Kuanyin, Arok and vice president George Kongor, it is unclear just exactly where all this is leading. Riek Machar, perhaps perturbed by the lack of progress on the Council for the South, as well as by his lack of status within the regime, has requested that he be allowed to travel abroad to put the case for &quot;peace from within&quot; and the 10 April Charter to Southerners living in exile. The regime has not yet given permission, perhaps suspecting that the renegade commander may never return from such a trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr Machar sent delegations to Europe and the USA to explain the charter. His supporters claim that former US President Jimmy Carter has been instructed by the Clinton administration to persuade Colonel Gurang to sign up to the charter. There is little substance to such a bizarre, wishful story.  It all sounds like part of the regime's propaganda claim that the US administration was putting pressure upon the SPLA leader to sign up to the 10 April Charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nuba Factor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two little known Nuba men have recently joined forces with the NIF regime.  Mohamed Haroun Kafi, who styles himself as chairperson of the central committee of the People's Liberation Movement of the Nuba Mountains, and Younis Duam Kalu, who styles himself as commander of the political wing of the New Sudan Forces, have both sounded criticisms of Colonel John Gurang and the SPLA. They have accused the SPLA leader of all manner of falsehoods and of betraying the Nuba people and the unity of Sudan by calling for Self- determination. The two men have now signed the 10 April Charter as separate movements for the Nuba people. The creation of new rebel groups and the splintering of the leadership under the 10 April Charter is now proving costly to the regime because it has contributed very little to the practical task of confronting the SPLA on the battlefields.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - TRIBAL CONFLICT BREWING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tribal conflict is brewing between two major tribes of the North-Western Province of Zambia. This has prompted an urgent appeal by chiefs and other concerned people for government to intervene and restore harmony. In recent months the Lunda and Luvale people in the province have been lashing out at each other in an apparent bid for supremacy in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, in a Lunda dominated region, a pastor was beaten for preaching in Luvale and in another incident, a Lunda man was also beaten for speaking in his language among Luvale men. Members of Parliament in the region have on several occasions tried to ease the tension but without much success. An appeal has now been made to President Chiluba to help solve the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP TO BOYCOTT ELECTIONS?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three days of deliberations at a national party conference, UNIP, Zambia's main opposition party, has resolved that it would contest the forthcoming presidential and parliamentary elections only if the polls were held using the 1991 constitution. The resolution is aimed at ensuring that the party's leader, Dr Kenneth Kaunda, becomes eligible to contest the presidency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the 1996 constitution Dr Kaunda cannot contest the presidency because his parents were non-Zambians, but UNIP resolved that it would not choose another candidate to run for the presidency on the party ticket. Some delegates to the conference had demanded that UNIP withdraw altogether from the elections, but after deliberations it was decided that this be done only if Dr Kaunda remained barred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Without Portfolio Michael Sata says Zambia cannot revert to the 1991 constitution because as far as the government was concerned, that constitution no longer exists. UNIP's Secretary General Sebastian Zulu countered by saying that should the government insist on using the 1996 constitution, both Dr Kaunda and President Chiluba would be barred from contesting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOW VOTER TURNOUT EXPECTED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unusually low turnout in the forthcoming elections is feared as thousands of voters cards are still uncollected at various points around the country. The Elections Office had earlier set days on which the registered voters could collect their cards but the response was not as impressive as had been hoped. The exercise of cards collection has been extended but the response is still poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trend in Zambian elections has been that only about 50% of registered voters turn up for the polls. For the forthcoming elections, only 2.29 million of the 4.6 million eligible voters have been registered. In 1991 when almost 3 million people registered, only 1.3 million people voted. The number of voters in the forthcoming elections could fall even further. With some voters cards still uncollected it may be that some potential voters are disillusioned about the abilities of Members of Parliament to live up to expectations and also have a fear of violence during the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DISABLED SEEK PARLIAMENTARY SEAT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The desire to have representation in parliament by the country's various interest groups has spread from the farmers and women to the disabled. The blind, the deaf and the physically handicapped have been pressuring government for a voice in parliament and with elections coming up, they are now considering some candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their only dilemma is that their numbers are insignificant in any constituency for any of their candidates to go through on the primary fact that he or she is a disabled person. But some prominent disabled persons, among them Pardon Katongo, the former chairman of the Zambia Federation of the Disabled, say that the solution could lie in the president of the day nominating at least one of them to parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DISABLED DISAGREE ON BID FOR SPECIAL STATUS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is disagreement among the disabled as to whether or not government should pass a law granting them special rights in society. While some say that there is need for this, others argue that this is demeaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Federation of the Disabled chairman, Hubert Lwaile, says that government should in fact speed up the presentation of the bill to parliament for enactment into law enabling the disabled to &quot;enjoy special rights other than those enshrined in the bill of rights&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He contends that the present Handicapped Act of 1969 &quot;has never addressed the real rights and needs of persons with various disabilities; hence the poor levels of living standards of many disabled Zambians&quot;. But the Zambia Association of the Blind in Special Institutions president, Derris Bwalya argues that only &quot;the disgruntled disabled would support the Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DRUG TRAFFICKING ON THE INCREASE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) is working on a bill which, when passed into law, would empower the organisation to fight money laundering which is said to be on the increase in Zambia alongside drug trafficking and drug consumption. The DEC spokesman Mukutulu Sinyani says that once the bill is passed in parliament, some commercial banks were bound to be closed because they are believed to be operating on drug money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DEC is concerned about an increase in drug operations in the country which is no longer only a transit point but is also a market and production zone. In recent months, the DEC has been destroying cannabis grown by small- scale farmers in at least five of Zambia's nine provinces. In one haul recently, drugs worth about 300 million Zambian Kwacha (about US$300,000) was seized by the DEC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RACE FOR PARLIAMENT HEATS UP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although voter turnout in the coming elections is expected to be low, the jostle for parliamentary seats is attracting many hopefuls, especially in the ruling MMD party which has just concluded interviewing hopeful party candidates. In some constituencies, up to eight aspirants have put in their applications and in some areas, fights among party members broke out over who should be adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several incumbent members of parliament have either been rejected by party members in their respective constituencies or they have opted to challenge for other seats. Some popular candidates have, however, had an easy first round as they are unopposed within the party ranks and they get the tickets to run in their respective constituencies. One of the key attractions among MMD aspirants will be the Vice-President Brigadier General Godfrey Miyanda who will contest the Petauke seat, which is his home area, and is the stronghold of the opposition UNIP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEFORESTATION WORRIES GOVERNMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian government is concerned with the fast rate at which forests are being depleted without a corresponding number of trees being planted to replace those being cut. Environmental minister William Harrington says that unless Zambians realise the importance of forests, the country could soon face serious environmental problems and adverse climatic changes. This has prompted local authorities in some districts to ban the making of wood charcoal which has been the major cause of deforestation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, however, concern too about forests being depleted by traders who cut hardwood mostly for export. According to forestry authorities in the Western Province, part of this export of hardwood is illegal. Efforts have in the past been made to curb the export of timber, but the trade has continue without much let-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">literacy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOXING TITLE THAT NEVER WAS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For three days the Zambian boxing fraternity was engulfed in euphoria over what they believed was the country's first ever world boxing title. The excitement arose after news spread across the country that heavyweight boxer Joseph Chingangu had won the International Boxing Federation (IBF) heavyweight title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Boxing Board of Control (BBC) officials were over the moon in excitement as they mobilised home-based boxers and fans to welcome Zambia's latest sports hero at the airport on his arrival from Italy after his triumph.  Chingangu's arrival even eclipsed that of a minister who was returning from a presidential mission to several African countries. The excitement was, however, watered down when it turned out that Chingangu's second round knockout victory over Laois Eros was not for the 'big time' title held by American Michael Moorer but for a junior version of the same weight division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't matter that this is not the big title. What Chingangu has done is still heroic,&quot; said the BBC chairman Hillary Matyola.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - As Zambia's political tension heightens, fears are growing that the failure by politicians to agree on issues of governance could lead to a military takeover of the country. The fears are compounded by the fact that a number of retired military officers, including several former army commanders, have been passing comment on fears that the civilians' failure to chart a harmonious political course could give the military an excuse for seizing power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments by retired generals and other lower ranking military officers have in turn caused concern in the Zambian Ministry of Defence which states that talk of a military takeover was &quot;extremely irresponsible and subversive&quot;.  Although the Defence Ministry dismisses the speculation of a military takeover as baseless, it charges that a political party was being helped in military training by one or more neighbouring countries, and being assisted by a donor country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have received strong reports to the effect that one or two neighbouring countries are assisting an opposition political party in military training of its members with the connivance of a donor country,&quot; says Deputy Defence Secretary, Colonel Timothy Jim Kazembe. Zambia's neighbours are Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Angola, Zaire and Namibia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those who have expressed fears about a military takeover is General Milimba Masheke, chairman of the main opposition party, UNIP, a former defence and security minister and ex-Prime Minister. General Masheke, who is also a former chief of military intelligence, reportedly said that the tense political situation in the country could lead to a military coup d'/tat. A retired former army commander General Kingsley Chinkuli is quoted as saying that &quot; a military coup would not be the solution to Zambia's political problems&quot; with another retired officer, Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Mbiya describing the political situation in Zambia as &quot;frightening&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence ministry, reacting to the statements, said &quot;these utterances (by) people who were not only at one time commanders of the Zambia Army but have also been ministers of defence and are holding senior positions in their political parties (are) extremely irresponsible and subversive&quot;. Colonel Kazembe said that the Defence Ministry &quot;has no doubt that these statements are an attempt to undermine the loyalty and confidence of the defence force in the government of the day and the nation as a whole&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kazembe pointed out that the Defence Force is founded on professionalism consistent with democratic principles and that it is therefore not true that &quot; the Defence Force as a whole or any unit in the Force is planning a military coup now or after elections&quot;. Zambia is scheduled to hold elections no more than three months after parliament is dissolved. The election date is not yet known although it is widely speculated that this will be October this year or January 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Defence Ministry has also warned political parties against attempting to sow confusion in the Defence Force by trying to draw its personnel into partisan politics using &quot;unfounded threats of army takeover of government in order to intimidate or blackmail other parties for political aims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lieutenant General Patrick Funjuka, the commander of the Zambia National Service, a semi-military wing of the defence force, recently warned service personal against partisan politics. He said with elections coming up soon there was bound to be heightened political activity, but as military personnel they should remain neutral. He said although they had the constitutional right to participate in voting, they should be seen to be non- partisan and that they should keep politics out of their camps. Although talk of a military coup is being brushed aside by the Defence Ministry, trends in Zambia's 32-year history seem to add rather than detract from the fears. On four occasions in the past 24 years, then president Kaunda faced four serious coup attempts, triggered by either constitutional issues or dissatisfaction with standards of governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although military personnel are generally urged to keep away from politics, many retired officers have become active politicians in both the ruling party, the MMD, and in opposition parties since the advent of a multi-party system.  Men with military backgrounds in the MMD cabinet include the Vice-President, Brigadier General Godfrey Miyanda, the Works and Supply Minister, Lieutenant Colonel Patrick Kafumukache and Foreign Affairs minister, Lieutenant General Christon Tembo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1989, General Tembo, a former army commander during Kaunda's reign and the then ambassador to West Germany, was charged with treason, along with several other military personnel and civilians. He was pardoned by Kaunda in a general amnesty for all political prisoners in the run up to the 1991 multi- party elections. General Miyanda had also been implicated in 1989 on charges of treason but was acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP also has several retired military men in their ranks. The most senior is the party chairman, General Masheke. Others include Major McPherson Mbulo - one of those charged but pardoned for the 1980 coup attempt - and two of Dr Kaunda's sons, Major Wezi Kaunda and Lieutenant Colonel Panji Kaunda, both members of parliament. Other notable figures are Colonel Joseph Chitomfwa and Captain Selemani Mphangula, who are among six people now facing treason charges. Both have been linked to UNIP. Colonel Chitomfwa, the former military intelligence chief, was key state witness in the trial after the 1989 coup, and the man said to have infiltrated the operations of the plotters and Captain Mphangula is president of the People's Party but has been more active in UNIP circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first coup attempt was made in 1972. A group of civilians protesting against Zambia becoming a one-party state and led by a former mayor of Livingstone, William Chipango, undertook to train some people in military warfare to take over the government. The training programme hit a snag soon after starting and many, including Chipango, were arrested. A small group, however, escaped into Namibia, then under the control of apartheid South Africa and after training this group, led by Adamson Mushala, managed to make its way back into Zambia to begin a guerrilla war. The group's efforts were concentrated in north-west Zambia and, although he eluded security personal for many years, Mushala was eventually cornered and gunned down. Chipango, however, has since come back to active politics and formed his own political party, the Congress Party (CP), which has, however, failed to lure any significant membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1980 coup attempt was led by a number of prominent lawyers, including Edward Shamwana - who also joined active politics after his release from prison in Kaunda's political amnesty. He is now chairman of the National Party, generally regarded as the fourth strongest party in the country. This coup was also crushed by the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most stunning coup attempt was in 1991, at the height of demands for a multi-party system. There were food riots in Lusaka and other major towns.  With the police failing to quell the rage, the army was eventually called in to assist. In the ensuing confusion some soldiers, led by a Lieutenant Mwamba Luchembe, tried to take over the government. The attempt failed and Luchembe was arrested. After his pardon, Luchembe joined the MMD but he has since fallen out of favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this background and with opposition parties insisting that there is either a constitutional or a political crisis in the country, fears of military intervention are heightened. However, the Chief of Police, Christopher Ndhlovu, has assured the nation that they are adequately prepared to quell any attempts to destabilise the country. President Chiluba has also given his assurance that the elections will be peaceful and that there was no need for panic and no crisis in the country with Deputy Defence Secretary Colonel Kazembe saying that &quot;the Defence Force has confidence in the steps that the government is taking to resolve the contentious issues.&quot; He appealed to the parties and other interest groups to resolve political problems amicably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Zambians, as evidenced by radio and television programmes and by letters to newspapers, fear a military takeover. Zambians generally pride themselves on being a peace loving people and it is this, the will of the people, rather than assurances by politicians and defence forces, which will ensure the country will, for now, and perhaps for many more years, remain a multi-party state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - EXTRAVAGANCE WORRIES ENVOY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi risks losing British aid if over-expenditure is not checked, British High Commissioner to Malawi, John Martin warned September 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his government was concerned that in the first quarter of the 1996/97 fiscal year the Malawi government overspent by almost K300 million (US$20 million). &quot;We make quite a substantial contribution to the 40% of the recurrent budget and we have interest in over 60% of the development budget,&quot; Martin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His remarks came at a time when Britain is considering giving Malawi K480 million (20 million pounds sterling). The High Commissioner said the decision on this will depend to a certain extent on whether the Malawi government will get expenditure under control in the second quarter. He said his government is concerned that Malawi is losing a lot of revenue through corruption, citing the Customs and Excise Department where he said government is unable to collect 20 to 50% of its revenue. He welcomed the establishment of the anti-corruption bureau, saying Britain is ready to provide technical advice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHURCH VOICES INSECURITY WORRIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Seventh Day Adventist Church has added its weight to complaints about rising insecurity in the country. Representatives told President Muluzi that people lived in fear and uncertainty, expecting the worst to happen to them or their property at any time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While we appreciate government's efforts in trying to enforce law and order, we as a church believe there must be total law and order,&quot; said Pastor Wenson Masoka, leader of a nine-member Malawi Union of the SDA delegation that called on the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masoka complained to the President that some employers and school institutions were forcing his SDA Christians to work or take part in sporting activities on the Sabbath Day, Saturday, which he said was contrary to SDA teachings. &quot;Some of our Christians have been threatened with dismissal for simply following the church's teachings as portrayed in the Bible,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muluzi said in response to the concerns and requests for assistance from the church that the government would consider how to assist in renovating some of its schools and health institutions which he said were important to the welfare of Malawians, adding that the church and state were partners in progress. Muluzi said the government was equally concerned about security and that this was one of his government's priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PLANS FOR HOTEL ROLL OFF THE DRAWING BOARD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi's tourism industry received a boost September 24 with the signing of a contract by a Malaysian company and Malawi Development Corporation to build a K300m (US$20m) 150-bed hotel - the biggest in the country - in Blantyre.  Dato Leong, Chief Executive of the Malaysian company involved, G-Two Holdings, investing in Africa for the first time, said he was impressed with Malawi, adding that he thought the country had a lot of potential for upmarket tourism investment. He also announced his intention to build a modern holiday resort in the lake shore district of Mangochi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MDC's, General Manager Elvas Kadzako said the two firms had also discussed other joint ventures such as the establishment of a mortgage bank, a commercial bank and a low cost housing project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEASLES OUTBREAK IN MALAWI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sporadic cases of measles have been reported in the central and southern regions of Malawi. Health officials say they have mounted a vaccination campaign that is expected to prevent the outbreak from reaching epidemic levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhoda Kammwamba, assistant maternal child health officer in Blantyre said 34 cases from Blantyre city south had been reported. Most of the patients found with the disease were more than five years old, while others were up to 15 years old. By September 24, some 53 cases had been treated at one health centre in Zingwngwa township alone. Most of the patients were treated as outpatients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health officials in the central region said there were reports of sporadic cases in Mchinji, Salima, Dowa and some parts of Dedza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPPOSITION PARTY FOUNDING MEMBER DIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A founding member of the opposition Alliance for Democracy (Aford) and a member of parliament Dr Dennis Nkhwazi died in a South African hospital on Saturday after a long illness. Nkhwazi, 57, who languished in detention from 1972 to 1977 under the one party state, was one of the prominent opposition figures who spoke out against the one party dictatorship when the wind of change started blowing across Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was earlier hospitalised in Germany and South Africa for six months and returned home last July. In 1992, along with Aford president, Chakufwa Chihana, and with the support of few other people in exile, they launched Aford as an underground pressure group which was later to become a fully- fledged political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He became the MP for Rumphi East, north Malawi, where Aford commands biggest support, in 1994 during the country's first multi-party elections. He was appointed minister of Transport and Civil Aviation when Aford went into a coalition with the ruling United Democratic government. He was later dropped in a cabinet reshuffle, but continued to command a strong influence not only in his party but also in parliament. During the last sitting of parliament, he tried to sell the idea of a federal system of government which was yet to be accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was also a founding director of Phwezi Foundation for Education of which he was general secretary until his death. Dennis Greyshan Simphawaka Nkhwazi is survived by a wife and five children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU WARNS ON GOVERNANCE CORRUPTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outgoing European Commission head of delegation, Peter Christiansen has warned politicians not to destroy democracy by avoiding give-and-take on important issues. &quot;If you are to make democracy work, you have to compromise.  There is no winner, nor loser,&quot; Christiansen said at a press briefing at the end of his three year tour of duty in Malawi. He said although democracy is not the best system it is much better than dictatorship, adding that it was the politicians who destroy it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He commended the judicial system in the country which he said has made a very good contribution but said politicians should stop commenting on judgements and accept them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On corruption, Christiansen said it is still a major danger in any country and said everybody must provide information rather than accuse government of not doing anything on rumours about corruption. &quot;I'm get a little upset when some ex-ministers talk about it without coming up with evidence,&quot; said Christiansen, adding that the Anti-Corruption Bureau must be given time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed disappointment with the Malawi Broadcasting Corporation saying it was a pity the broadcasting act, which gives overriding powers to the minister responsible for the radio, is still in force well into the multiparty era.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - President Bakili Muluzi on September 24 accused his predecessor, Hastings Banda of having swindled the government out of K82 m (US$5.6m ) for personal use, just before the general elections that ousted him in 1994.  Muluzi said he had an audit report on the alleged fraud which he said he would submit to the newly established anti-corruption bureau.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a rally in his home district, Machinga, some 120 kilometres east of Blantyre, in a live broadcast on MBC, Muluzi also described Banda as &quot;the most corrupt leader in Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muluzi at the same time launched a barrage of attacks on print journalists, whom he accused of receiving money from former cabinet minister Rolf Patel, who has launched his own political party, to write malicious stories against his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the accusations, MCP Secretary General L. Munlo lashed out at Muluzi for abusing the state run radio to make what he termed baseless allegations against people who cannot answer back using the same forum. Munlo wondered why the president had kept quiet on an audit report of this nature, only to disclose its contents at a public rally when he was angry and shaken by the wave of criticisms against his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Munlo said Muluzi was just out to take revenge on Banda because the former leader sacked him when he was secretary general of the MCP. Munlo called on the president to probe other corruption malpractice's, among others the FieldYork notebook scam involving the present UDF Secretary General Sam Mpasu.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - A reconciliatory meeting of Malawi's leading parties scheduled for October 7, to be brokered by a human rights body, Malawi Institute of Democratic and Economic Affairs (MIDEA), remains the only hope to break the impasse between government and the opposition over the latter's boycott of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leader of the Opposition in parliament and MCP vice president Gwanda Chakuamba, whose party - along with Aford - has been boycotting parliamentary sessions, said one of the main items lined up for discussion during the meeting was the issue of appointing cabinet ministers from the opposition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bakili Muluzi's retention and appointment of cabinet ministers from Aford after the break-up of the coalition was the main reason for the walkout from parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All parties boycotted a Public Affairs Committee offer last week to bring them to the negotiating table over several pressing issues that have caused a rift between government and opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition has maintained its stand on, saying on 26 September that PAC had lost credibility to broker such an Indaba because its chairman, Lutheren pastor Joseph Bvumbwe was pro-UDF. Bvumbwe is trustee chairman of the disputed reconstructed Press Trust, a position he accepted from the UDF government and which the opposition says compromised his neutrality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Aford and the MCP have vowed they would not return to parliament until Muluzi stopped &quot;poaching&quot; members of parliament without the consent of the parties on whose ticket they are MPs, or until the ministers from the opposition were declared to have crossed the floor to the ruling UDF.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Hannover is the name of a city in a Germany. But next time you are in Blantyre, Malawi's commercial city and hear about the Hannover trade, do not be mistaken into thinking that Malawi has notched a trade agreement with any country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are talking about women who hang out along Hannover Street in Blantyre at night and indeed enter into trade agreements in which the commodities are nothing but their bodies. They are referring to the world's oldest profession which some young girls in Blantyre make no secret about as their source of bread and butter - prostitution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi has for ages been trade marked 'The warm heart of Africa' and indeed, many a visitor to this tropical-weathered, but poverty-stricken country has gone back home nursing a holiday hangover due to the memorable time spent on holiday in the warm heart of Africa. Ask any of these visitors what qualifies Malawi to be so appraised, apart from the magical waters of Lake Malawi, and they will talk of the friendly smiles and hospitality of Malawians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospitality, however, has nothing to do with the commercial sex offered by the woman who stands in dark corners, in the middle of the road and under the roofs of corridors along Hannover Street plying her trade. The warm heart of these girls is of a different kind. This type of trade is the pure trade of lust and risks. Ironically, those involved in it claim that it has benefited many in this poverty stricken country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask Hawa Mbewe for example. She has all the answers to questions you can ask her about Hannover and what goes on along the street - the good and the bad part of it. At 22, Hawa has done what the majority of university graduates in Malawi cannot do after working for five years. She has built herself a semi-executive house valued at over K80,000 (US$5,340) in the sprawling shanty, Mbayani, a stone's-throw away from the hustle and bustle of Blantyre from trading her body to various clients who cannot resist her looks upon seeing her on Hannover Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occasionally, Hawa changes her trading posts to other entertainment joints in the country. &quot;entertaining clients is a special art. If you do it right, the customer will come back, as memories of the good times will haunt him even after flying thousands of kilometres overseas to Europe or America,&quot; says Hawa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says that although she prefers the 'up-market' class of foreigners and expatriates as her special clients, sometimes she gets hooked by some locals just for the fun of it to alleviate what she calls &quot;worries of some disgruntled husbands with their family problems.&quot; But she says locals are a problem in that they like abusing the women by sometimes just using them without paying for the services they render.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prevent falling prey to such &quot;scoundrels of customers&quot;, Hawa says - and most of her friends - they engage the services of personal body guards. These range from thugs in the shanties around Blantyre to security watchmen guarding the premises and offices along Hannover Street and the other streets nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stella Banda,18, who has been a prostitute for over five years says apart from providing protection in times of need, security guards also provide rooms in and around premises they guard where the prostitutes can take their &quot; short time&quot; customers, for a small fee. &quot;The watchmen are usually bribed, amounts ranging from K10 upwards, for providing us with shelter to entertain customers who cannot afford our full-time rate at a rest house or hotel, or are in a hurry to spend a long time with us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stella considers herself one of the reasonable prostitutes, charging K200 for short time service and any amount over K350 for the whole night, excluding the costs of beer and accommodation. She says some trustworthy watchmen, who find it easy to provide accommodation and protection, are given an allowance of K200 as retainers every month. Several watchmen confirmed they are hired by night raiders to do some errands for them ranging from protection, hiding the more discrete customers and alarming them of any impending danger, more especially when rogue and vagabond patrol police are approaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ndi pa tauni pano amwene ndingatani? (This is town my brother, what else can I do to supplement my meagre salary apart from playing to the tunes of these prostitutes?)&quot; said one security guard. He says the scenes they see at night are very nasty and they only accept to give room just because of poverty. Another watchman lamented that when the going gets tough for the prostitutes, for instance when they are running away from police and other angry clients, they are compelled to hide them until they are of danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do this but are risking our jobs. What if our bosses decide to come at night and find out we entertain these acts taking place around premises that look decent during day time?&quot; he questioned. The guard, however, &quot;questioned the sense of other respectably looking gentlemen who leave the comfort of their homes and their wives to come to Hannover Street and indulge in adultery around stinking alleys&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also expressed concern that contrary to the numerous warnings, bill boards, radio and press advertisements on the dangers of AIDS, people, both local and foreign, still preferred to have sex with high risk groups such as these 'Hannover girls'. Authorities, of course do not condone prostitution and neither do tourism officials who clearly state that tourists do not come to come to this country for sex. The tourism ministry abhors the tendency of some owners of rest houses and motels who use their facilities as brothels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willie Chingaru, police spokesman on the issue of girls hanging around entertainment joints and public places at night says: &quot;The police have the power and the authority to arrest any woman found loitering at night and they can lock them up any time.&quot; Others feel that the starting point would be for the police to curb this increasing trend in prostitution by rounding up the watchmen and security guards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent statistics show that Malawi and Zimbabwe remain in the lead in HIV/AIDS occurrences in the SADC region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - When United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher begins his first trip to Africa today, he will not be stopping in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Christopher's visit is being promoted as part of the United States efforts to showcase democracy, economic progress and peace in Africa, apparently Zambia is not among the African countries showing these three traits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Christopher &quot;felt it is very important for him to go there so that he can work with these leaders directly on their turf and visit some important countries&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher is scheduled to stop in Mali, Ethiopia, Tanzania, South Africa and Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Twaddell, deputy assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, said Christopher's visits with President Oumar Konare in Mali and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in Ethiopia would reward those two leaders for guiding their countries to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tanzania, Christopher will speak with President Benjamin Mkapa, former President Julius Nyerere and other regional leaders on topics including how to deal with tribal warfare that has left hundreds of thousands dead in nearby Burundi and Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher will also visit the headquarters of the United Nations International Tribunal on war crimes in Rwanda, which is set to begin its first prosecutions for the 1994 massacres in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the topics Christopher will discuss with African leaders at those stops is an administration proposal for an Africa Crisis Response Force - composed of troops from African nations - to provide safe havens for civilians during conflicts or natural disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Angola, Twaddell said, Christopher's aim will be to shore up a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">process of national reconciliation between President Jose Eduard Dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, his major opponent in the civil war that raged in that oil- rich nation for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretary's stop in South Africa, Twaddell said, will remind the world of that nation's peaceful transition to black-majority rule and, US officials hope, to stimulate business interest in investing there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would say it's good that the secretary is personally involving himself in those areas: political reform, economic development and conflict resolution efforts,&quot; Twaddell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this is Christopher's first visit to Africa, the Clinton administration has been active on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, the administration organized the first-ever White House Conference on Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before he perished in a plane crash in Croatia last spring, Ron Brown was doing a good job in trying to promote trade and investment in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration also deserves credit for appointing a special envoy to help warring factions make peace in Angola and for finding funds to help the OAU and individual African nations take on peacekeeping duties in some of the continent's various trouble spots.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A second-minute rebound hit by inspirational Kenneth &quot;Bubble&quot; Malitoli yesterday saw Zambia collect three vital points against the Mambas of Mozambique in an African Nations Cup qualifier at Lusaka's Independence Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malitoli, who was playing deep in the midfield, hit the back of the Mozambican net after the Mambas goalie, Basillio Luis, was completely beaten by the ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Zambia increased the pace of the attacks after the clincher, the Mambas playing a 4-4-2 formation in the first half as compared to Zambia's 3- 5-2, also summoned a lot of players in the backline to frustrate the Zambians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was Mwape Miti, playing as a twin striker with Dennis Lota upfront, that was a threat to the Mambas as his mere hold on the ball resulted in a lot of panic for the visitors that had only one serious attempt at the Zambian goalie, Davies Phiri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Mozambicans, with skipper, Conde Francisco, doing much of the attack, were no push-over, it was the Zambian striking force of Mwape Miti, Dennis Lota and the midfield comprising Vincent Mutale, playing a defensive midfield role, Joel Bwalya, very outstanding in attacks and Bubble Malitoli, that was a delight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sixtieth minute attempt by Lota, who was very well assisted by the wingers-Andrew Tembo and Jonson Bwalya, was thwarted by the Mambas who seemed determined for at least a draw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And national team trainer, Roald Poulsen, in a post-match interview, said he was not bitter with the narrow victory as the three points counted most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a very good match and I think players like Mwape Miti, and others played a very good game. I am not bitter because in such competitions, the important thing is simply to win, and since we have won, I think we are safe,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Mambas coach, Arnaldo Salvado, bragged that his team stands a chance of reversing the scores in the return match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The game was tough and Zambia has proved that it is a good side, but still, I think we will win when Zambia comes to Mozambique. We will have the same chances of playing at home just like Zambia had,&quot; the coach said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Dejection and down cast eyes characterised soccer fans yesterday after the Zambia national team struggled to beat unfancied Mozambique 1-0 in the opening African Nations Cup qualifier which was played at Lusaka's Independence stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most, if not all, the game was the lousiest ever since Roald Poulsen took over as coach of the Chipolopolo Eleven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The game was lousy,&quot; observed Chipolopolo Fan Club chairman, Elijah Chisanga. &quot;The system we used, 2-5-3, failed. We should go back to our usual system of 2-4-4.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Chisanga, &quot;the midfield was crowded and players kept running out of ideas&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This view was shared by Mozambican coach, Arnaldo Salvado, who pointed out that &quot;Zambia did not play well&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We deserve to have won. It's just that there was no justice on the pitch,&quot; Salvado said without elaborating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the fans interviewed expressed similar sentiments with some calling for Poulsen's blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He should be fired,&quot; remarked a fan who travelled all the way from Chipata for the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps, no one could have put it more succinctly than stand-in captain, Johnson Bwalya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should have won this game by a large margin,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;But we fumbled a lot of chances. Anyway that is the name of the game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Midfielder, Andrew Tembo, who perhaps was the biggest culprit added: &quot;It happens in football. Sometimes you play well and other times you fail to tick.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But coach Roald Poulsen seems content with the result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At least we got three points,&quot; Poulsen said in a post-match interview, adding: &quot;The biggest problem was the pitch. It's too bumpy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was supported by his erstwhile pal, Danmark's Brondby FC team manager, Emil Baekenhoff, who is in the country on a player buying spree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The field is not good, something must be done about it,&quot; Baekenhoff said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyday, about six thousand five hundred hectares of African savanna are being cleared,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Annual rituals of bush-burning during the dry season is taking its toll on the forest reserves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Achi, the general manager of the Environmental Protection Authority in Nigeria's northern state of Kaduna, was speaking Monday at the opening of a three-day sub-Saharan Africa Forum for Environmental Journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the over-exploitation of African forests had resulted in droughts, land degradation and the &quot;concomitant spread of arid and desert lands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kaduna State alone, he said &quot;no fewer than ten lorry loads of firewood&quot; were carried to other states everyday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another dangerous trend, he added, industrial pollution coming from the dumping of toxic wastes in some African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the trend pointed to &quot;a deepening environmental crisis,&quot; especially for developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his welcome address, the secretary-general of the sub-Saharan Africa Forum for Environmental Journalists, Sani Malumfashi, said there was need for the active participation of the mass media in the crusade for a cleaner environment for all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - Industrial action in South Africa during the first nine months of 1996 cost the country a total of 1.35 million man-days -- an increase of more than 50 percent on the 870,000 man-days lost through strikes in the corresponding period of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was revealed here Monday in a report by labor analyst, Andrew Levy and Associates, which showed that after a slow start, the number of man-days lost in industrial action rose sharply in the third quarter of 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, the report adds, &quot;although quite a jump on last year's figure, it is still well below that of the previous three years and is not expected to exceed the two-million mark by the end of the year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, South African strikes cost the country 2.5 million man-days in the first nine months of the year; the figure for 1993 was 2.4 million; and in 1992 a total of 3.1 million man-days was lost in industrial action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third quarter of 1996 was dominated by two major strikes which resulted in a combined loss of 784,000 man-days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were the illegal strikes at the Rustenburg Platinum Mine involving 28, 000 workers, and the seven-day strike by 80,000 South African clothing and textile workers' union members in the clothing industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major reason for strikes in South Africa in this period was wages, (59 percent), followed by grievances, (39 percent).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - The fortunes of the brewery industry in Nigeria are on the decline as alcoholic beverages, the sub-sector's main money earner, now attract low patronage from consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 1993, we used to sell more than five cartons of beer daily but now two cartons of beer sometimes last for two days or more before the drinks are sold out,&quot; says Biola Fagbemi, a bartender at a popular restaurant in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fagbemi says the current trend in the sale of lager beer is general.  According to him, more people are trying to reduce their alcohol intake, while others are opting for the non-alcoholic drinks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public affairs director of Guinness Nigeria Plc, Ulu Mba, confirms the problem facing the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry, which produced over 15 million hectoliters of assorted beverages from its installed capacity of 18.3 million in 1993, has declined to less than five million in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mba claims that only two breweries, (Nigerian Breweries Plc and Guinness Nigeria Plc), out of 13 currently producing, could be said to be doing so conveniently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Managing Director of Nigerian Breweries Plc, Felix Ohiwerei, says his company is not faring any better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, he said, in 1991, 180 million cartons of his company's products were sold, but the production was halved in 1992 and dropped to 86 million in 1993. The figure has further plummeted in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of Guinness Nigeria Plc, although its turnover appreciated to 8.  074 billion naira from 5.201 billion in 1994, its pre-tax profit fell to 786.  076 million naira from 898.512 million in 1995 (80 naira = 1 USD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decline was attributed to economic depression which has resulted in many factories operating below their installed capacities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohiwerei, who is also the chairman of the beer group of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, has described the current production level of the beer industry as the worst ever in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spill-over effect is also felt on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, where securities of the listed breweries have failed to attract investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has adversely affected the price movement of their securities, resulting in losses with brokers, in response to the market trend, marking down the sub-sector's share prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capital market operators attribute the poor performance of the industry to high rate of inflation, officially estimated at 72.8 percent, and which has continued to erode the consumers' purchasing power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists believe that most Nigerians now restrict themselves to their basic needs, resulting in the accumulation of products of the brewery industry in warehouses across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same vein, Ohiwerei attributes the lowered production capacity of the brewery industry to the consumers' weak purchasing power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said because of the depressed economy and weak purchasing power of consumers, tied to the level of inflation, many shareholders and consumers now resort to selling their financial commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beer is no more on my priority list. Before, I used to buy beer in cartons but now, I consider it a luxury I can hardly afford,&quot; says John Uche, a businessman in Lagos. &quot;I only drink beer at social functions where it is offered free of charge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Okey Okeke, a civil servant, the high cost of beer has forced him to become a teetotaller -- the minimum price of a bottle of beer in Nigeria is 35 naira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to industry sources, other reasons for the malaise in the brewery industry include scarcity of foreign exchange in the last five years, which has prevented companies from procuring foreign input like machinery for production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brewers also cite religious reasons for the decline in their business, with many former beer parlors turned into churches, and former drinkers transformed into &quot;born again&quot; christians, preaching against alcohol consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the breweries are trimming their labor force to remain afloat.  Sources at the Nigerian Breweries Plc, for instance, reveal that about 48 managers and 500 junior workers in the company's four plants located in Lagos, Ibadan, Enugu and Aba have been relieved of their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Premier Breweries, Consolidated Breweries, Guinness Nigeria Plc, among others, have similarly laid off some of their workers earlier in the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vigorous sales promotion campaigns aimed at boosting beer consumption are currently being mounted by the beleaguered breweries. Their effect remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohiwerei suggests that the only viable option for the industry is to broaden its operational capacity and concentrate on the production of non- alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique - The killing of the Swiss anthropologist,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicole Bezencon, on the outskirts of Maputo September 30, and the apparent inability in solving the crime, are threatening to undermine bilateral cooperation between Mozambique and Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy general-director of the Swiss Cooperation Office, Rudolf Dannecker, arrived in Maputo Sunday to discuss the Bezencon killing and its implications with the Mozambican government, and with the rest of the donor community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swiss Embassy said Monday said that Danneker was &quot;perplexed and dismayed&quot; by the murder.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is also worried at the general deterioration in the security situation in Mozambique and is demanding a rapid and convincing explanation,&quot; the embassy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that the future of Swiss aid to Mozambique would depend on Dannecker's discussions in Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bezencon was killed at Tsalala, about 15 kilometres from central Maputo, in broad daylight as she was returning from a school belonging to the National Water Board where she taught. The motive was car theft and the two armed assailants seized her four-wheel drive vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Mozambican colleague travelling with Bezencon, Carlos Munguambe, escaped but was seriously wounded. He is still undergoing treatment in Maputo Central Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the heads of diplomatic missions in Maputo met at the Swedish Embassy to discuss the sharp rise in violent crime and the government reaction to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of its aims was to ask the government for &quot;a political signal&quot; indicating its commitment to the fight against crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge d'affaires at the Swiss Embassy, Gregor Binkert, told reporters that donor representatives in Maputo were &quot;very worried&quot; at the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could have negative effects on the country's economic recovery, and on development cooperation programmes,&quot; he said. He added that the donors want concrete and speedy results from the investigation into the killing. A week has passed and the police has made no public statement on the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, the Swiss Embassy has found that there were clues that should be followed up. Binkert said that the two assassins had been by the roadside &quot; for many hours waiting.&quot; Many people in the area knew who they were, he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - The Nigerian head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, Tuesday urged African countries to present a common front in the crusade to correct the imbalance in the world communication and information order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must not give up our desire to take greater control of our destiny and reverse our peripheral system in global information system,&quot; he said in a message to the opening of a conference of the World Association of Press Councils in Abuja, the Nigerian capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have for too long allowed ourselves to be heavily buffeted by unrestrained misinformation from external mass media to the detriment of our national interests,&quot; Abacha said in the message delivered by his deputy, Lt.  Gen. Oladipo Diya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing the power of information and Africa's remarkable disadvantage in information gathering and management, the Nigerian leader charged the conference to address the &quot;repercussions&quot; of Africa's continued disadvantaged position in the world communication and information order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants are also to proffer solutions to this &quot;unacceptable situation&quot; and strive for the enhancement of journalistic practice and intrinsic relationship between responsible journalism and Africa's developmental goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the discussion of rights and privileges of the press must take account of the socio-cultural environment in which the press must render service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There cannot,&quot; he said, &quot;be any demand for rights without responsibilities or freedom without a corresponding obligation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the association to give guidelines on press performance worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is to enable journalists and other bodies charged with national security to &quot;advise themselves on the limitations that what the world accepts should be placed on the exercise of the freedom of the press.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - The plan for the purchase of Nigeria's liquefied natural gas by Turkey marked the high point of economic talks between the two countries, Nigerian officials said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the officials, Turkey is proposing to buy at least 100-million- U.S.-dollar worth of Nigerian gas a year, to boost trade between both countries currently amounting to less than 100 million dollars per annum.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bilateral talks form the highlights of a two-day visit by Turkish Prime Minister, Neometin Erbakan, who arrived in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erbakan met Monday with Nigerian head of state Gen. Sani Abacha, while their officials held separate talks under the two nations' joint economic commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister, due to leave Abuja later Tuesday, was accompanied by a 250-member delegation of private sector representatives and officials, including four ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During preliminary talks that preceded Erbakan's visit, Nigeria proposed 14 areas of cooperation with Turkey, aimed at boosting the level of bilateral economic undertakings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These included commerce, tourism, construction and consultancy services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others were technical and scientific cooperation, agriculture, banking, health matters, free trade zones, telecommunications and transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also covered by the proposals were the liquefied natural gas project, education, housing and petro-chemicals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A Zambian team of women chess players that went for the 32nd Chess Olympiad in the former Soviet republic of Armenia returned smiling, after emerging as Africa's best team in the Women's category.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Zambia Chess Federation (ZCF) president, David Hamoonga, who led the Zambian delegation, the all-woman Zambian side came out top ahead of twelve other African countries including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Mauritius, Reunion Island, Uganda, Swaziland, Angola and Mozambique.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was overall a very impressive performance by our team, and although we did not bring any physical honours, the fact that we came out as the top team in Africa speaks a lot,&quot; said Hamoonga in an interview on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ZCF boss, who had travelled with national ladies champion, Brenda Mumba of Zamsure Lusaka, Mercy Banda of Four Knights Lusaka, Dessy Mwanza of Nkana and Joy Mtine of Zamsure Ndola, claimed that much better results could have come out had Mumba competed in other boards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brenda, being the Zambian champion was made to compete in Board One, which was the toughest. But had she competed in other boards, something could have been done,&quot; Hamoonga said of the tournament held from September 15 to October 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the poor performance by the Zambian champion saw her drop on the World rankings from position 2265 to 2206, while another Zambian , Joy Mtine moved up to number 2265.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia could not send a men's team because of lack of money.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Four time African champion, Satwant Singh, has opened up a twenty point lead on the 1996 African Rally Championship drivers' standings after finishing first at the just ended Caltex Equator Rally in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Driving a Subaru Impreza, Satwant scored twenty points in the highly competitive 1,000 km race to bring his total tally to seventy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An excited Zambia Motor Sports Association (ZMSA) treasurer, Aaron Chungu, said at a press briefing yesterday that this win puts Satwant in good stead to scoop the 1996 African title.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Satwant has proved that he is a hero. He finished first out of forty-two cars,&quot; Chungu said, explaining: &quot;With this win, he has opened up a twenty point lead and with only one more rally to go-the Total rally of South Africa- it's most likely that he will win the 1996 African title.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Satwant's closest rival on the log is Kenyan Azar Anwar, who finished sixth and collected a paltry eight points. He now has 50 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On third position is Peter Lansdell of South Africa who has accumulated 24 points thus far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am very happy with the result,&quot; enthused Satwant, who is populary known as the &quot;Flying Sikh&quot;, in a telephone interview from Nairobi, Kenya, yesterday.  &quot;It (the rally) was very fast and very rough and clearly the level of competition was very high. The Kenya Open (as the rally is normally referred to) is one of the toughest in the whole series.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, could not immediately indicate whether he will take part in the deciding Total rally slated for October 17 to 19, in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's too early to make a decision on whether I will take part or not,&quot; Satwant said. &quot;I want to fix my car first as I have damaged the left front suspension and the cross member very badly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZMSA president, who is also Satwant's wife, Lee-Anne, expressed relief at the result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was very strong opposition, especially from the Ugandan, Emmanuel Kato,&quot; Lee-Ann said in a telephone interview from Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the first time that Satwant has won this elusive round of the African championship. In his two previous attempts ( 1993 and 1994) he finished third after damaging his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, on the navigators standings, Satwant's navigator Surinder Thatthi of Kenya, is leading the pack with 50 points after collecting 20 points in the Equator rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On second position is Shammi Khan of Kenya who has amassed 42 points while on third position is Eddie Verlaque of South Africa with 24 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, according to the final results faxed by the Clerk of Course, Andy Najee, the Zambian clocked 08:01 hours and 33 seconds. Hard on Satwant's &quot; wheels&quot; was Glen Edmunds who clocked 08:23 hours and 55 seconds. Nazir Verjee of Kenya finished third.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - It is criminal and immoral for the government to confer more powers on the Zambia Security Intelligence Service (ZSIS), an institution guilty of abusing its citizens and subjecting them to inhuman and degrading treatment, charged Civil Society chairman, Lusaka lawyer John Sangwa, on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sangwa, at a press briefing at Lusaka's Pamodzi Hotel last Friday, said the proposed legislation, through the amendment of the Zambia Security Intelligence Service Act, was counter to the recommendations of the Human Rights Commission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is insane for the government to confer police powers on the ZSIS when recommendations of the Commission, after listening to horrifying stories from citizens who suffered at the hands of this institution, was that such powers should be taken away,&quot; Sangwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ZSIS Bill No 34 of 1996, among other things, has broadened the circumstances in which intelligence officers are expected to use firearms. It also confers power on the officers to obtain search warrants and search premises, persons and intercept telecommunications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contributing to a debate on the Bill last week in Parliament, National Party president Humphrey Mulemba charged that the government was creating &quot; elimination squads and merchants of death&quot; through the legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find it unacceptable that our intelligence service should be transformed into what is being proposed,&quot; Mulemba, who is also Solwezi Central National Party member of parliament, charged. &quot;They (intelligence officers) are supposed to be collectors of information. It will be dangerous to arm them.  We will turn the intelligence service into elimination squads and merchants of death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sangwa implored the government to consider recommendations of the Commission which say the role of the ZSIS be confined to intelligence gathering in matters relating to state security and that ordinary police powers be withdrawn from intelligence officers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) executive director, George Grey, yesterday said the recently launched Inventory Credit Scheme (ICS) may be shunned by grain traders due to the prevailing high interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray, in an interview yesterday, feared that although the scheme had not yet &quot;kicked-off&quot;, the ICS was not likely to be fully subscribed to by grain traders as maize prices had remained low while the current interest rates were very high.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wouldn't be surprised if the scheme doesn't kick-off this year as very few people are interested because of high interest rates while the maize prices are flat,&quot; Gray said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government abandoned the initial Maize Marketing Revolving Fund in preference to the ICS, citing operational modalities and the &quot;mischanneling of funds&quot;meant for the maize marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture minister Suresh Desai announced in April, this year when the scheme was launched, that ICS would be allocated about K52 billion from which farmers would source funds for the purchase of maize after depositing grain in the scheme's reserves.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The government has responded favourably to the advice for a review of the liberalisation policies in a bid to check the collapse of companies in the manufacturing sector due to unfair competition from cheaper imported goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commerce, trade and industry deputy minister Alfred Lienda, making the announcement last Wednesday at the official launching of Gillette range of products, revealed that the government would review the liberalisation policies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lienda admitted that from the time the country had opened its doors to the outside world, several companies in the manufacturing sector had collapsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is addressing this problem to resuscitate the falling manufacturing sector,&quot; Lienda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that as a result of cheaper imports, Zambia was slowly turning into a trading nation as the manufacturing companies were subjected to unfair competition from traders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economics Association of Zambia chairman, Griffin Nyirongo, on Thursday called on the government to consider protecting the manufacturing sector by not fully liberalising the economy as most companies had no capacity to compete with rival companies in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyirongo was commenting on the decline in the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which he partly attributed to the almost collapsed manufacturing sector.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The current fuel crisis in the country is likely to last until the end of the year unless government gathers resources to repair the oil pipes at the Indeni Oil Refinery in Ndola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources on the Indeni board of directors, the plant needs extensive rehabilitation costing millions of dollars which neither the company nor the government seems to have.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem at Indeni seems to be more financial than technical,&quot; said Transporters Association of Zambia chairman, Charles Madondo, in an interview yesterday. &quot;I think the statement from the Minister of Energy Edith Nawakwi was not true.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He revealed that truckers were feeling the pinch already when they had to park trucks for over two days in search of fuel.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba wants the UNIP treason detainees convicted so he can exercise his presidential powers to grant them amnesty and make political capital out of it, claims a South African intelligence report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also reveals that it is President Chiluba who instructed Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Gregory Phiri to prosecute the eight UNIP treason detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba, who invited Rhema Church pastor, Ray McCauley, to attend the Ndola Trade Fair in July this year, made his intentions known in private discussions with the South African clergyman who was also on a mission for the South African ministry of foreign affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the due process of the law had been followed and that the eight individuals had been convicted, he Chiluba under his presidential powers would grant amnesty to the convicted individuals and this would happen before the next election,&quot; the intelligence report claims this is what President Chiluba had told pastor McCauley.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African intelligence document, which contains debriefing notes of the trip undertaken by pastor McCauley and the church's press officer, Ron Steele, in July this year, also says President Chiluba told pastor McCauley he would &quot;give instructions to speed up the prosecution of the eight individuals concerned in the treason and murder trial&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And presidential press aide Richard Sakala, who complained about The Post coverage of his recent South African trip, on August 19 demanded for a written press query which was promptly faxed to him on the same day but has remained unanswered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But reacting to the South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African intelligence document, Steele in a fax dated August 8, confirms both the meeting in Ndola between President Chiluba and pastor McCauley and the subject of discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steele, however, disputes some details of the discussion while confirming that President Chiluba referred to the amnesty for the detainees once convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pastor McCauley did say they had discussed the question of amnesty for the treason trial eight and he (McCauley) got the impression that President Chiluba might be looking at this possibility,&quot; Steele says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steele also confirms a number of points in the intelligence report as having been subjects of discussion between President Chiluba and pastor McCauley but differs on some details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the intelligence document the South African foreign ministry was involved in pastor McCauley's visit when they asked the clergyman to discuss with President Chiluba &quot;the current situation in Zambia with specific regard to the Constitution and its withdrawal thereby allowing a level playing field in the next elections and the UNIP detainees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Steele denies this, claiming an American missionary, a Reverend David Newberry invited McCauley and that the South African government had nothing to do with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South African foreign affairs department never once contacted pastor McCauley or myself,&quot; Steele says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, unlike the intelligence report, Steele says that pastor McCauley accepted the invitation because Newberry assured him that President Chiluba would attend and that &quot;it would be a good opportunity to speak to President Chiluba in view of the concerns we have about his image in the South African media&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On this basis pastor McCauley accepted the invitation because he thought it would be a good opportunity to speak to President Chiluba in view of the concerns we have about his image portrayed in the South African media,&quot; Steele says, adding: &quot;Because of President Chiluba's Christian confession Pastor McCauley was interested to hear Chiluba's side of the story and to encourage him to maintain democracy in Zambia, which had been his platform of success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steele, however, accepts as correct a paragraph in the intelligence report which says President Chiluba told the pastor that &quot;elections would be free and fair with the participation of UNIP but Kaunda would not under any circumstances be allowed to stand&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steele also accepts the general comments in the intelligence document where it says &quot;the shops are full and the situation in the country looks to be very good, things are working well&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a remark of mine made whilst in Ndola and later in South Africa and was made in the context of comparing my last visit to Zambia about six years ago,&quot; Steele says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steele further admits as correct the intelligence document's entry that &quot; after discussions with various and random individuals during this visit it was concluded that Chiluba was still very popular with the people of Zambia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was the general impression gained from one day in Ndola and from speaking to the general public at the crusade and to dignitaries at a banquet in the evening,&quot; Steele says in reply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Steele disputes the document's entry that President Chiluba &quot; admitted to have been deceived by some members of his cabinet who were not Christians&quot; and he instead says: &quot;President Chiluba never told pastor McCauley he had been deceived by some cabinet members. He had willingly confessed he had been over zealous to see Christian participation in government. Subsequently he had corrected this to ensure that only the best qualified person got the job, irrespective of religious belief.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - Mozambique Port and Railways has increased tariffs for the Beira port and rail from the beginning of October, to cater for increasing maintenance costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial representative of the company, Gabriel Mabunda, said in an interview rail tariffs had gone up slightly, but port tariffs had not yet been changed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The increases are relative to the types of goods carried,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increases would affect the volume of Zimbabwe's exports through the porta as the tariffs were still competitive and the Beira port was an economic route for Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabunda said Mozambique railways had not increased tariffs for the past 10 years, but had started to make adjustments from last year to try to cover maintenance costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Beira port last year handled about 1,712,000 tons of cargo and until September this year, had handled 1,519,000 tons of cargo and 17,000 containers from Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The line has the capacity to move more cargo....&quot;, he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya - The International Center for Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) in Nairobi received a grant of 200 million kenya shillings (about 3.6 million U.S. dollars) Wednesday from the Swiss government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The funds, released through the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation, are to be used in research.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will cover the period 1996 to 1999 and follows a similar grant of 144 million shillings (2.62 million dollars at today's rate) in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday's agreement was signed by the Swiss ambassador to Kenya, Peter- Hans Erisman and the center's director-general, Hans Herren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the most significant recent breakthroughs at ICIPE is the uncovering of the chemical basis of locust communication and behavior,&quot; Herren said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This discovery, he added, will pave way for the environmental sound control of the insect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center depends on grants. For the 1994 fiscal year, it received 9 million dollars from 23 donors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - It is estimated that one in every 10 people in Zimbabwe is infected with the AIDS-causing virus, HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, in 1995, for example, more than 42 million condoms were distributed for a population of 11 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe also has more than 52 support groups of people with AIDS, more than 60 NGOs dealing with the pandemic, and at least 100 companies which have HIV/AIDS prevention programmes within their work places for their employees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is still lacking is the clear and significant evidence of behavior change to impact on the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, &quot; said Dr Everisto Marowa, head of the National AIDS Coordination Programme, Tuesday at a conference on AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in the past few months 300 people were dying from AIDS every week, Marowa said, now the deaths were between 300 and 500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although over 42 million condoms were distributed in 1995, there is no guarantee that they were all used. Peer educators present at the conference said users were often skeptical because of numerous untrue rumours about the latex device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The educators said there was need to work hard to dispel rumours that the condoms were laced the HIV virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marowa said it was estimated that by the end of 1996, more than 200,000 people would have developed full-blown AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He applauded the growing number of support groups constituted by people with AIDS, saying they were a positive trend through which infected people could help one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said he was concerned at the continued absence of a national HIV/AIDS prevention and control body in Zimbabwe, especially now when infection is rapid and weekly deaths have almost doubled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another impediment in the fight against AIDS, he pointed out, was the absence of a working national multi-sectoral committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are concerned that in 1996 we do not have an AIDS body to provide advocacy and direction in prevention and control and we also do not have a national multi-sectoral committee to motivate and mobilize the different sectors,&quot; said Marowa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - South Africa's projected population over the next 15 years is expected to show a substantial drop as a direct result of AIDS-related deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The University of South Africa's Bureau Research revealed in Pretoria this week that AIDS could cause the country's projected population for the year 2011 to be 750,000 below the expected figure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report entitled &quot;Global Population Growth and Structural Changes in the RSA Population 1951 - 2011&quot;, the Bureau said: &quot;The South Africa population is expected to grow at a rate of 1.7 percent per annum from 42.1 million in 1996 to 54.1 million in the year 2011&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But,&quot; the report added, &quot;if AIDS deaths continue at the current rate, the population may be three-quarters-of-a-million less than the projected 54.1 million&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said AIDS deaths were expected to increase by almost 23 percent in the next 14 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bureau also revealed that South Africa's so-called brain-drain was less dramatic than many people assumed. In the five years up to May, 1996, almost 4,000 more immigrants entered the country than the number of emigrants who left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The effect of legal migration figures on population figures for South Africa is minimal,&quot; according to the report, which also estimated that the country's population should eventually stagnate at around 103 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report warned that rapid population growth in developing countries hampered economic growth, led to the degradation of natural resources and promoted poverty and income inequality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurses, working at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, who went on strike in September for almost a week, resumed their strike Monday, saying they would only return to work until their demands for 100 percent salary increment and improved conditions of service were met.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UTH assistant public relations officer, Pauline Mbangweta, confirmed to PANA in Lusaka that the nurses had defied the management orders and did not turn up for work Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reports we have received so far indicate that one or two nurses reported for work, but the majority have decided to stay away,&quot; said Mbangweta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital had mobilized military medical personnel and other volunteers to keep operations running. The latest strike has been joined by nurses in government-run clinics in the city's townships.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia'a geographical location and pattern of trade makes her exports expensive resulting in uncompetitive pricing of her goods, deputy commerce, trade and industry minister Alfred Lienda told Parliament yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lienda, responding to a question by ruling MMD's Kafue member of parliament Yusuf Badat who wanted to know what trade barriers the country's businessmen were facing when exporting their products to European markets, COMESA states, North African states and the Middle East, said Zambia's geographical location is making exporters incur high freight costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lienda told Parliament that Zambia enjoys preferential access to the European markets for most of its primary products under the Generalised Systems of Preferences Schemes within the context of the Lome Convention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For manufactured items, such as sugar, access to European market is through quotas,&quot; Lienda said, adding that Zambia has recently been admitted to the European Sugar Protocol with a zero quota allocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This implies that Zambia can only export to the European market if other countries allocated quotas fail to meet their commitment,&quot; Lienda explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also disclosed that stringent application of regulations and standards in respect of manufactured and processed goods militate strongly against Zambia's exports into the European market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambia is not in a position to fully comply with ISO 9000 standards that are applicable in the European markets and are very high,&quot; the deputy minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the COMESA states, Lienda said the trade barriers faced by Zambian exporters relate to tariff levels and existenc of import licences and foreign exchange regulations in some member countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some member countries have not complied with the agreed time table for reduction of tariffs. This has created tariff distortions in COMESA, consequently posing trade barriers to Zambia which has fully liberalised its economy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also told the House that the only countries that Zambia trades with in North Africa are Egypt and Algeria - under trade agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further said although the middle east is the country's source of crude oil, it has not been Zambia's trading partner and there are no identifiable barriers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conclusion, Lienda said &quot;there are no trade barriers to exporters wanting to export to Zambia&quot; but that agricultural products require &quot; phytosanitary certificates and animal products require veterinary certificates.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A long term fund facility to help banks in Zambia invest in all sectors of the economy is being created by the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facility, which is intended to improve the lending capacity of commercial banks, will divert World Bank's funding from certain institutions, such as the Development Bank of Zambia, to commercial banks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources at the World Bank office in Washington explained that commercial banks were seen to be more responsible in terms of management as they would ensure that the funds were recovered to the fullest possible capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the on-going World Bank projects at DBZ, such as the Coffee II project, would be let to run the projected course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Bankers Association Chairman, Bill Irwin, disclosed in a statement to The Post last week that the proposal for the World Bank's new funding facility was discussed with his association some months back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new financial institution will be an apex organisation only responsible for the treasury function of disbursing drawings to individual banks and receiving repayments from them,&quot; Irwin said in a statement on October 3. &quot;At present it is envisaged that the credit risk would rest with participating commercial banks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irwin revealed that the World Bank initiative will also &quot;include a matching grant scheme to assist with capacity building&quot;. He said it was unlikely that arrangements would be finalised before the end of the first quarter of 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - An appeal by opposition UNIP and the Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) to have the contract between the government and Nikuv Computers (Israel) Limited for the updating of the voters' roll declared null and void was yesterday dismissed by the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full sitting of the Supreme Court, comprising Chief Justice Matthew Ngulube, deputy Chief Justice Bornaventure Bweupe, Justices Matthew Chaila, Dennis Chirwa and David Lewanika , however, upheld a decision of the High Court to remove the veil of secrecy on the Nikuv contract saying the government erred in marking a public issue &quot;Top Secret&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court threw out all the nine grounds of appeal raised by the two opposition parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In ground one, counsel (for UNIP and LPF) argued that the learned trial commissioner misdirected himself by finding that the evidence of Rabson Mwansa satisfactorily responded to the applicant's apprehension that many eligible voters may be disenfranchised...,&quot; Justice Lewanika read out the judgement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court found that the apprehension by the applicants was without foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our understanding of his (counsel) apprehension is that the contract should not have had a cut off of 4 million voters cards as he thought that the number expected to register would have exceeded...,&quot; justice Lewanika said and explained that Mwansa had said only 2.5 million had so far registered and that the apprehension was over optimistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second ground of appeal was that the commissioner was wrong at law not to find a connection between the electoral officers who were responsible for electoral malpractices and the MMD party when the electoral officer in each district is a town clerk or a district secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court disagreed with this appeal saying even in the Second Republic, town clerks and district secretaries were appointed as electoral or registration officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Note that section 15 of the Electoral Act as read with Regulation 5 of the Electoral Regulations 1973 do not prohibit the appointment of a town clerk or district secretary as registration officers,&quot; the judgement read in part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the third ground, the commissioner's finding that Isaac Zimba's evidence appeared fabricated, was upheld and the fourth ground on the possibility of a conspiracy to rig elections was also thrown out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP secretary general, Sebastian Zulu's evidence that Nikuv was an intelligence organisation was dismissed for lack of proof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court was also satisfied that the Electoral Commission did not abdicate its role to Nikuv Computers and that there was no grounds upon which commissioner Mutale could have nullified the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two parties were appealing against a decision by High Court commissioner Bornaventure Mutale not to quash the Nikuv contract although he admitted to a lot of irregularities in the awarding of the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But argument in a cross-appeal by State Advocate, Abdul-Aziz Kinariwala that the contract was right to be marked &quot;Secret&quot; was also thrown out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court agreed with the commissioner that the contract was wrongly classified as &quot;Secret&quot; and he was right to set aside that classification because an election is public issue and should be as open and transparent as possible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Parliament yesterday sealed the presidential candidates' qualifications in support of the 1996 amended Constitution by passing the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 1996 through committee stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a deputy minister confessed in Parliament yesterday that one non governmental organisation has 'misinformed' the people about the Land Act so much that traditional chiefs have now become hostile to the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition UNIP Petauke member of parliament, Lavu Mulimba, protested during debate on the Electoral Bill that the government has failed to clarify the clause that allows presidential candidates to declare their nationality on the strength of the word from their chief or clergy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is this the proof that we were promised would be elaborated upon? To rely on a candidate to provide his own proof where not even his uncle, father, grandparents or any other relative can testify remains unsatisfactory,&quot; said Mulimba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In answer to Mulimba's observation, Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda said if there was any dispute it was to be determined by a full bench of the Supreme Court under Article 41.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such an appeal could, however, only be made 14 days after the date of elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miyanda dismissed Mulimba's calls that the returning officer be given the powers to reconsider a rejected candidate saying petitions presented after nominations would unnecessarily delay the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill was passed with Mulimba emerging as the only dissenter in the committee stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day lands minister Peter Machungwa, presenting a ministerial statement on the 1995 Land Act, said out of the seven provinces where officers from his ministry have held seminars on the Land Act, chiefs from one province which he, however, did not name expressed hostility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This NGO is only referring to Section 3 (1) which talks about vesting land in the hands of the President without explaining anything else,&quot; Machungwa said. He did not name the NGO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machungwa's response, however, drew a question from MMD's Bweengwa member of parliament, Edgar Keembe, who wanted to know whether government would deal with erring NGO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is not my area. But the Honourable Home Affairs minister, Chitalu 'Stalin' Sampa, may wish to deal with this particular individual,&quot; Machungwa replied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal - The World Food Programme has stopped distributing dry food rations in parts of strife-torn Liberia because of fear of attack by faction fighters in the civilian population, leaving tens of thousands of hungry people without food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a news release Thursday, the organization said the fighters were harassing the civilians, stealing food and any other commodities they have.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are worried about the security of our beneficiaries&quot; said Arnt Breivik, WFP'S country director in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, WFP and its partners distributed two-week rations to almost 40, 000 hungry people in Tubmanburg and Cape Mount county. However, recipients became targets of foreign fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, WFP is now only engaged in limited targeted wet-feeding programs -- where the food is cooked and then given to people on the spot -- in Tubmanburg and Cape Mount county. WFP food is now only reaching about 2, 500 people in these areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although we are very concerned about the malnutrition levels in these parts of Liberia, we cannot put these people at risk&quot;, Breivik said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - The chairman of Liberia's Council of State, Ruth Perry, has described the support of the international community for the country's peace process as slow and inadequate, and appealed for more assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the United Nations General Assembly in New York Thursday, Perry particularly criticized the lack of a strong support for the Nigeria-led sub- regional peacekeeping force, ECOMOG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said since the initiative to deploy ECOMOG in Liberia in 1990 it had been hoped that the mission would receive the full support of the U.N.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, the assistance of the international community has been both slow and inadequate, thereby imposing severe pressure on the scarce resources of the member states of ECOWAS,&quot; added Perry, Africa's first woman head of state.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the efforts of ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States) must be complemented by the international community through the provision of substantial material and financial support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is therefore my appeal that the U.N. assumes its share of the burden of peace-keeping in Liberia,&quot; she said, noting that &quot;the sub-region is facing extreme economic hardships due to external factors beyond its control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the assembly that the last ECOWAS summit in Abuja had given renewed hope for peace in Liberia, in spite of the set-back caused by the fighting which broke out in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perry thanked Nigeria, to whom she said Liberians owed &quot;a debt of gratitude, &quot; and other members of ECOWAS for their sacrifices for the quest for peace in Liberia, and the U.S., the Netherlands and Germany for their assistance to ECOMOG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Perry warned that Liberian women will take over the country's leadership if the faction leaders fail to work toward the achievement of peace in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they (the faction leaders, who are all men) do not want to cooperate with us..., I will ask the women to please come on board and lead the country, &quot; she told a news conference in New York, after the speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted, however, that her male counterparts on the six-member council had been cooperating with her since she assumed office in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will be a stabilizer among the male counterparts,&quot; she said, adding &quot; we've been working together. We've been cooperating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said her selection to lead Liberia at a critical stage in the country's search for peace reflected the recognition of the active involvement of Liberian women in the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The resolution of the Liberian conflict is therefore not only a challenge to me but to all Liberian women, yea, women in Africa and the world,&quot; Perry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia supports the decisions emanating from conferences on the advancement of women, particularly the Beijing conference held last year, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 57-year-old Liberian leader, who was a senator in the 1980s, was selected to replace the former chairman of the council, Wilton Sankawulo, at a summit of ECOWAS leaders in Abuja in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit also approved a revised time table for the implementation of the Abuja accord, the latest in a string of peace agreements aimed ending the Liberian civil war, which has claimed more than 150,000 lives since it started in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the revised timetable, elections are scheduled for May 30.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports Minister Jim Nwobodo distributed the cheques to the victorious athletes and officials at a ceremony in Lagos Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly elected chairman of the Nigerian Football Association, retired Col. Mumini Aminu received the cheque on behalf of the players.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of the under-23 soccer gold-winning squad but one player got one million naira, about 12,500 U.S. dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Jonathan Akpoborie, who plays for Hansa Rostock soccer club of Germany was excluded from the reward because he left mid-way during the Olympic soccer gold campaign to attend to club assignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athletes who benefitted from the windfall included police woman long jumper, Chioma Ajunwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silver-medalists including sprinter Falilat Ogunkoya, received 750,000 naira (about 9,375 U.S. dollars) each, while bronze winners such as African track queen Mary Onyali-Omagbemi got 500,000 naira (about 6,250 U.S. dollars) each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athletes who won no medals got 100,000 naira (about 1,250 U.S. dollars) each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The under-23 soccer team's coach, Willy Bazuaye received one million naira, while all other registered team officials got 500,000 naira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the whole, some 38.4 million naira (4,800,000 U.S. dollars) were disbursed to the Nigerian Olympic contingent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sum of 43 million naira was realized from individual and corporate donations to the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nwobodo said members of the Nigerian contingent to the paralympic games, which took place after those of the able bodied, are also to receive similar cash rewards from government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conspicuously missing from Wednesday's ceremony, although his cheque of 1.5 million naira is being kept for him, was Nigeria's national team Dutch coach, Johannes Bonfrere, who is at the center of a controversy for taking up temporary job with the Gulf state of Qatar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere, who is half way in a two-year contract with Nigeria, has been accused by Nigerian soccer officials of insincerity by taking up the two- month job in Qatar, during his vacation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials argue that the Dutchman has some explanation to make if he resumes work in Nigeria at the end of this month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya - The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) , has warned that despite an improved food supply in sub-Sahara Africa, 13 of these nations are suffering from food shortages and emergencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless exceptional food assistance is allocated to these countries, the agency said in a report, the countries will face increased hardships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, by the agency's Global Information and Early Warning System's chief, Abdul Rashid, urged large-scale national and international interventions to bring about a rapid improvement in the region's food security situation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, carried in a quarterly special issue on the food supply situation and crop prospects in sub-Saharan Africa, comes ahead of the World Food Summit scheduled for Nov. 1 to 17 at agency's Rome headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hardest hit countries are Burundi, Liberia and Somalia. Other countries facing serious food emergencies include Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency cites civil strife, displacement of hordes of rural population and economic sanctions as main hindrances to food supplies in such countries as Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It calls on the international community to focus on adequate relief assistance in Liberia, the affected populations in Somalia and Sudan as well as other parts of Southern and Eastern Africa as areas requiring assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others include refugees and internally displaced persons and vulnerable groups in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite the continuing problem areas, there are marked improvement in Southern Africa in terms of food supply,&quot; the agency says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It estimates the sub-region's 1995/96 grain crop harvested earlier in 1996 at 19.8 tons, some 89 percent above the 1985 drought affected level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency notes that the level of cereal imports required in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to decline in 1996/97, reflecting improved harvests in Southern Africa and elsewhere in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says about 40 percent of the total population in sub-Saharan Africa is chronically undernourished. The number could rise from the current 215 million people to 265 million in the year 2010, unless an action is taken to stem the trend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - United States secretary of state, Warren Christopher, said Thursday his government has resolved to work closely with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in promoting peace and strengthening its conflict management mechanism in the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am an admirer of the OAU, particularly of its activities in recent years in promoting peace and its efforts at conflict resolution,&quot; he told diplomats at the OAU headquarters in an address on &quot;the OAU and peace in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He emphasized that the proposed All-Africa Crises Response Force which Washington DC is helping to build was is not a standing force but a humanitarian one to protect lives with the full backing of the U.N. and the OAU.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher reminded the diplomats the U.S. government had worked closely in the past with OAU in such conflict situations as Somalia, Angola, Mozambique, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest proposal by President Bill clinton for establishing the African force is a logical next step of strengthening this working relations for a viable peace in the region, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher said the U.S. interest in peace in Africa is also aimed at strengthening its economic links, &quot;beneficial two-way trade links rather than aid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this to be possible, he pointed out, peace must prevail in the continent, countries must initiate economic reforms, build democracy, promote development through popular participation and stamp out corruption. &quot;These cannot be attained with the endless drain of lives and resources in conflict situations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcoming Christopher, the OAU Secretary-General, Salim Ahmed Salim, said he considers U.S. support to the organization's efforts for peace and conflict management as a great encouragement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The OAU is determined,&quot; he said,&quot; to work assiduously towards ensuring that an atmosphere of peace, security and stability prevail in the continent so that the energies of the African people would be focused on what constitutes the most challenging task before our people, the task of improving the living conditions of our people...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also called for greater understanding of the U.S. government of the critical issues undermining Africa's development efforts, namely the debt burden, transfer of resources and technology to African countries and the promotion of foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Christopher and Salim held talks lasting over two hours on a wide- range of issues. Christopher also toured the facilities of the OAU conflict management center and its early warning system, which was built and equipped with American financial support.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accra, Ghana - Shares on the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) Wednesday finished a drab session lower in thin trading, weighted down mainly by Ashanti Goldfields Company (AGC), which was subdued by declining gold price on the world market.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The merger will certainly enlarge and strengthen AGC's portfolio of world class gold properties in Africa and its market value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other equity decliner was Mobil Oil Ghana Limited (MOGL) which lost 100 cedis to close at 6,400 cedis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Pioneer Tobacco Company (PTC) and Ghana Commercial Bank (GCB) continue to consolidate their market gains with two cedis and one cedi respectively at 128 and 762 cedis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market capitalization, however, dropped to 3,015.34 billion cedis from 3,110.73 billion cedis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - More than three hundred striking nurses were by yesterday said to have been dismissed by the University Teaching hospital (UTH).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And labour minister Newstead Zimba said on ZNBC Tell The Nation radio programme yesterday that the strike by most of the essential workers in the country was distabilising operations in the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UTH public relations manager, Don Mwape, said the nurses had defied a management ultimatum to call off their action and resume work by 14:00 hours yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have noted with concern that you have taken part in an unconstitutional action contrary to UTH Disciplinary code 4.6 (a). You are therefore, requested to report to your supervisors at ward or departmental level by 14: 00 hours on Wednesday 9th October, 1996, failure to which you consider yourself to having terminated your services with the board,&quot; read the letter signed by acting human resources manager, Evaristo Kasompe and dated October 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwape told The Post in an interview yesterday that the UTH action will however, only affect those nurses directly employed or contracted by the hospital board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The decision will only affect those nurses directly or indirectly employed by UTH. Those from the clinic centres though on strike, do not fall under us,&quot; Mwape explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said only about one hundred and eighty-seven nurses had complied with the ultimatum and resumed work by yesterday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health minister Katele Kalumba asked the nurses to return to work on moral grounds because their strike would result in a number of lives being lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most nurses insisted their conditions of service, mainly their salaries, should be reviewed before they called off their strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And primary school teachers in Kitwe have refused to return to work after failing to reach an agreemnt with the government over their salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike also spread to Mpika, Nakonde, and Mbala districts of the nothern province.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambia Amateur Athletics Association (ZAAA) executive committee last Sunday endorsed the selection of veteran Francis Mukuka and Noah Chilongoshi to represent the country at next week's international meet in China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selection of the duo, comes in the wake of differences within the ZAAA top leadership over alleged irregularities in team selections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Differences raged after word went round that bare-foot, Fackson Nkandu and Sam Mwape who were both believed to be unsuitable for the China meet were ZAAA's choice. The two run between 5,000 and 10,000 metres while the China meet will focus on marathon races which are a speciality of Francis Mukuka and his colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The differences culminated in the resignation of secretary general , Phili Kubombela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was decided to pick Francis Mukuka and Noah Chilongoshi because we thought there was no reason to divide ourselves over a simple selection,&quot; said an official who attended the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an effort to get an official position from Kubombela, who bounced back as general secretary last Sunday, flopped as he was said to be on his way from Kitwe to Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sources further disclosed that apart from the two that will leave for China before Wednesday next week, eight other runners will be picked after two weeks to represent Zambia at the Uganda international meet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other eight will be picked at a tournament to be held at Nkana Stadium in two weeks time, but these two will start off for China before Wednesday next week,&quot; said sources.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A leading Zambia Motor sport promoter has expressed concern that continued high levels of breaking motoring rules could doom the future of Zambian motor rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaine Von Kalckstain, who heads the JUA KALI Motorsport promotions, wondered in a letter to The Post yesterday that it has taken just too long for authorities to act on rule-breakers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, well, well, I can hardly believe that a Clerk of the course of a Zambian rally has finally had the courage to disqualify Mr and Mrs Satwant Singh for breaking the rules,&quot; reads part of the letter she wrote yesterday following the disqualification of four-time Africa Motor rally champion, Satwant Singh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaine, who warned that the clerk of the Siavonga Fun rally where Satwant was disqualified after he used a short cut, Fleming Mumba that he may pay for his courageous stance since Satwant's wife, Lee Anne happens to be the president of the Zambia Motor Sports Association,(ZMSA). She further claimed that Satwant did not win the 1996 Zambia International Rally held earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real winners of the 1996 Zambia International Rally were Jamie Whyte and Phil Archenoul of Zimbabwe, and the leader on points for the African Rally Championship at that stage was Azar Anwar of Kenya. It's too much to hope that the ZMSA will make an effort to correct this situation at this stage, but Zambia would have gained greater credibility in international motor sport circles had justice been done in July this year at Control 29,&quot; says Jaine in her letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when efforts to talk to Satwant family were made, Satwant was said to be out of the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The MMD government will be illegitimate after October 31 and the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) has announced that it will not recognise it after that period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But chief government spokesman Amusaa Mwanamwambwa described the ZDC position as &quot;immature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press conference address which highlighted about eight major disagreements with the MMD government and stipulated the way forward, ZDC says there is no negotiation to the fact that the MMD mandate expires this month-end.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As ZDC, we shall have no recognition of his (President Chiluba) government after 31 st October and therefore reserve the right to take whatever steps necessary to ensure that Mr. Chiluba does not extend his stay in office beyond 31st October, 1996,&quot;said ZDC president Dean Mung'omba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mung'omba did not indicate what practical measures his party will take to express its non-recognition of the Chiluba administration after October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He outlined ZDC's opposition to the recently passed Electoral Bill which gives President Chiluba regulatory powers; the lack of government commitment to ensure counting of votes took place at polling stations and the lack of equitable access to public media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other areas of disagreement were the Public Order Act, the Nikuv voters cards which ZDC wants substituted with National Registration Cards, the continued detention of UNIP leaders and the government adoption of 1996 constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mung'omba anchored his party's message on a summary that ZDC shall consider the MMD government illegitimate after October 31 and will refuse to recognise it unless it called elections by that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without Mr. Chiluba going through an election and without him obtaining the essential mandate through consensus, it will be impossible for Mr.  Chiluba to extend his stay in office without contravening the constitution and unilaterally abrogating the contract he went into with the Zambian people in 1991,&quot; Mung'omba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concluded on a four point demand that &quot;genuine legitimate free and fair elections&quot; be held before 31st October, 1996. ZDC will boycott elections if they will not be pre-viewed as free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other demand is that &quot;a national indaba of all political stake holders be convened to resolve&quot; the issues it raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC also wants modalities of a transition government to be agreed upon ahead of time by all political stakeholders; &quot;in the event that Mr. Chiluba's term expires without holding elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fourth demand was that Chiluba takes steps to preserve national security during the period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC's stance has been supported by a newly-formed non-governmental organisation , Pan-African Peace Foundation of Zambia (PAPF) which also called for dialogue among political parties to iron out the current political differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Issues relating to the constitutional impasse and the controversial Nikuv voters' register are all very sensitive and could lead to violence in the country. The MMD must discard its intolerance and political immaturity and ensure that these conflicts are resolved before it is too late, &quot; PAPF president, Clive Kunda said in an interview in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But chief government spokesman Amusaa Mwanamwambwa, said he was surprised that ZDC were giving deadlines because the government had already made its position clear over the issue of the term of office. He called on all political parties to operate within the law in preparation for the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are calling on everybody to work within the law particularly the Constitution. Any sign of operating outside or without the law does not show maturity,&quot; Mwanamwambwa said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Versatile, brilliant attacking midfielder. This is how South Africa's Spur Amazulu coach, Mike Makaab, described former international, Tenant Chilumba, in a telephone interview from Durban yesterday, wondering: &quot; Why is such a player not featured for the Zambian national team?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formerly of Power Dynamos, Chilumba is now playing for the top South African premier division side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is not the same player you knew, he has improved a lot and I really can not understand why he cannot be called to play for Zambia, he is a very good attacking midfielder,&quot; disclosed Makaab, adding: &quot;He does not fear defenders and faces them, he is a world class player.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makaab wondered why Roald Poulsen is not calling Chilumba to beef up his team in the World and Africa cup run ups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trainer, who further disclosed that Chilumba has been instrumental in getting Amazulu vital goals, said he is now working on the player's defence tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is a very perfect attacker and all we are doing now is simply working on his defensive tactics, once he masters playing as both an attacking and defending midfielder, he will be very hot,&quot; enthused the coach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But national team coach, Roald Poulsen, whose side clearly lacked a play- maker last Sunday, was said to be out for a holiday in Livingstone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chilumba was dropped from the national team last year when Zambia played Gabon at the Independence Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has had professional spells in Saudi Arabia and Morocco and was a silver- medalist with the Zambian team that finished second to Nigeria at the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations in Tunisia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington D.C. - Africare will salute former President Jimmy Carter for his lifetime of humanitarian achievement -- promoting peace and human rights, enabling self-help development initiatives -- at the 1996 Africare Bishop John T. Walker Memorial Dinner on Thursday evening, October 17, at the Sheraton Washington Hotel in Washington, D.C. That same event will feature a celebration of Africare's 25th anniversary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For Africa and for Africare, this will be a momentous occasion,&quot; says Africare President C. Payne Lucas. &quot;Jimmy Carter has contributed so much to Africa. He's helping about a dozen nations on the road to food self- sufficiency. He's addressing Guinea worm disease, river blindness and other causes of ill health. He's easing tensions among nations and between cultural groups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And,&quot; Lucas continues, &quot;Mr Carter's contributions reach far beyond Africa alone. Through his Atlanta-based Carter Center, he has reached people in 65 countries worldwide, including our own. His programs have been outstanding.  Even more remarkable has been Jimmy Carter the person -- for just as he has promoted human dignity, he deeply and genuinely exemplifies that principle.  Jimmy Carter relates to all people, all races, all classes, all nationalities.  We are, therefore, extremely proud to have this opportunity to mount a major tribute to a truly great human being.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The annual Dinner is now the largest benefit in the United States for Africa, with proceeds supporting Africare. The event attracts about 2,500 people and raises about $1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Colin L. Powell, USA (Ret.) and Alma Powell are the 1996 Dinner's National Honorary Patrons. As National Chair this year, Africare is privileged to have Jan Leschly, Chief Executive of SmithKline Beecham. Carter Administration veterans Jody Powell and Valerie Pinson are serving as the event's General Chairs. Sam Donaldson will emcee. Andrew Young will make the award presentation to Mr. Carter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event attracts notables in the U.S. government and in international and corporate circles, from heads of state to leaders of the Fortunate 500 and almost the entire African diplomatic corps in Washington. Past speakers have included President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, President Nelson Mandela, then-President Nicephore Soglo of Benin, the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum and South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founded in 1971, Africare is the oldest and largest African-American organization specializing in aid to Africa. Africare has carried out several thousand programs, reaching millions of people, in 35 nations Africa-wide over the past quarter-century. Today, Africare has about 150 programs in 28 nations, from Egypt to South Africa. Africare's work is in food, water, the environment, health and emergency humanitarian aid as well as enterprise development and governance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United Nations - Nigeria has urged Jonas Savimbi, president of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), to take urgent steps to update UNITA's implementation of key issues in the Angolan peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in New York Thursday, during a Security Council debate on the Angolan peace process, Nigeria's ambassador to the U.N., Ibrahim Gambari, said that UNITA's wavering commitment to the peace process was of &quot;serious concern&quot; to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the peace process was being implemented in &quot;fits and starts&quot; largely due to the intransigence of UNITA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest report of the secretary-general on the situation in Angola...  contains a catalogue of broken promises, half-hearted implementations and non- compliance, mostly if not entirely by UNITA, with the obligations it has assumed under the peace accords,&quot; Gambari added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian envoy listed UNITA's failure to hand over its heavy weapons to the U.N. mission, procrastination over the incorporation of UNITA troops into Angola's unified armed forces and the restriction of the activities of the U.  N. forces as part of the obligations which it (UNITA) had failed to fulfil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He therefore appealed to UNITA to respond positively to all the appeals that had been made by African and world leaders, and called on those with leverage on the parties to help bring about a speedy implementation of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gambari said that while Nigeria supported the exertion of further pressure on UNITA, the organization's leadership should be given more time to &quot;restore our faith in their expressed desire for peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Stan Mudenge, the minister of foreign affairs of Zimbabwe -- representing the five countries mandated by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to attend the debate -- urged the council to act to stop UNITA's intransigence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The time has come to say enough is enough,&quot; Mudenge told the council. &quot; Recalcitrance and obstinacy should not be tolerated, or worse still, rewarded, &quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwean foreign minister called for the freezing of UNITA's bank accounts and closing of its offices unless it was willing to honor its commitments under the Lusaka protocol, signed in the Zambian capital in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe, acting on behalf of SADC, had on Monday requested an urgent meeting of the council to consider the &quot;critical situation&quot; in Angola, where several peace agreements had failed to end two decades of internecine civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his latest report to the council on Angola, the U.N. secretary-general also expressed &quot;serious concern&quot; about the delay in the peace process and recommended only a two-month extension of the mandate of the U.N. mission in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe is not keen on a Multilateral Investment Agreement (MIA) within the context of the World Trade Organization (WTO) because it might be forced to abandon schemes started to economically empower the majority blacks, a deputy minister has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in parliament, deputy minister of industry and commerce, Obert Mpofu, said the creation of the WTO had resulted in calls for multilateral negotiations on investments in WTO member countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea was to establish an agreement on investment within the framework of the rights and obligations of the WTO agreement, signed in the Moroccan resort town of Marrakesh in 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Zimbabwe to accede to MIA would among other things entail abolition of the affirmative action and indigenization programmes, said Mpofu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government has adopted the indigenization programme to facilitate the entry of blacks in the mainstream economy currently dominated by whites, who constitute less than one percent of the country's population of over 10.5 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpofu said it would also mean abolishing reserved sectors for local investors, opening the floodgates for foreign investors to make inroads in selected sectors which government wanted reserved for locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If government was to abolish the reserved sector list, it would then be forced to amend the Zimbabwe Investment Center Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpofu said acceding to the MIA would also mean amendments to some clauses and provision of national development plans and changes to parts of the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that each government should have freedom to choose its own particular policy mix combining liberalization with regulation, which can then be fine-tuned or altered according to the country's economic condition and development needs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He suggested that developing countries unhappy about the proposed MIA could use the forthcoming G-15 summit of heads of state and government, scheduled to be held in Harare next month &quot;to promote dialogue on this issue&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - Nine prominent Nigerian politicians, belonging to the so- called 'old brigade', have announced their withdrawal from active politics after their political association was denied registration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nine who formed the Social Progressive Party (SPP), made their position known in a statement issued Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They included six former state governors and two ex-ministers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since we remain peaceful patriots, we have resolved to withdraw from politics during the current transition programme,&quot; the nine said in the statement citing what they called &quot;unjust, unfair and highly provocative verdict of NECON (the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria),&quot; on the recent political party registration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifteen associations applied for registration, but only five met NECON's requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nine dissolved SPP chieftains, included Solomon Lar, former civilian governor of the middle belt state of Plateau, Lateef Jakande, who was governor of Lagos State and Abubakar Rimi, of Kano. The trio also served as ministers in the government of Gen. Sani Abacha, who has promised to return power to elected politicians in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The others are Sam Mbakwe, former governor of the eastern state of Imo, former information minister Jerry Gana, former education minister and senate president Iyorchia Ayu, and Sule Amido, national secretary of the defunct Social Democratic party of the botched third republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other two are Abdu Dawakin-Tofa, former governor of Kano State in the north as well as ex-governor Wilberforce Jatu of the old northern state of Gongola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said in their statement that &quot;this principled withdrawal by the leadership is to ensure the survival and protection of progressive ideals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have firmly resolved to stand for and promote the ideals of human rights, human dignity, human security, social justice, democratic government, the rule of law ...and the restoration of a free and democratic society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In legalizing the five political parties on Oct. 1, for the transition programme expected to end in oct. 1998, the electoral commission said politicians whose associations were not registered were free to individually join the five registered parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission warned that the unregistered associations remain dissolved and could not join any of the political parties as a group. This is to forestall &quot;hijacking&quot; of the legal parties by outsiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to a newspaper advertisement issued Thursday by one of the unregistered associations, special duties minister Laz Unaogu, warned that &quot; government would not allow anybody or group to make a mockery of the political process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not the time for mergers anymore,&quot; the minister said in a statement, adding: &quot;sufficient time was given for mergers but some of the associations refused to make use of it. Anything done in that regard now is illegal and subversive of the political process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political analysts said from the pattern of registration, associations tilted towards the so-called 'old brigade' politicians, partly blamed for Nigeria's political problem, would appear to have been rejected in favor of the so-called &quot;new breed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique - Mozambique is making preparations for the 10th anniversary commemorations of the death of Samora Machel, the country's first president, in a plane crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mozambican minister of culture, youth and sports, Mateus Katupha, Friday visited M'buzini, in South Africa, as head of a government delegation making the final arrangements for the visit of Machel's successor, President Joaquim Chissano, to the crash site next week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential plane, Soviet-made Tupolev, crashed on Oct. 19, 1986, killing 34 other Mozambican officials who were returning from a summit in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was lured off course, apparently by a pirate navigational radio beacon, using the same frequency as the Maputo airport beacon, and crashed at M'buzini, close to the point where the borders of Mozambique, South Africa and Swaziland all meet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chissano has urged Mozambicans to get involved in the commemorations and has appealed to them to raise funds to build a monument to be erected at the spot where Machel lost his life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Tony Fairall greets questions on his subject with a wry smile and the deceptive simplicity of a Zen master. When your daily work combines the task of mapping the unimaginable - our universe - and a job as director of Cape Town's planetarium, where you need to teach children and other neophytes about the cosmos, you have to have a special touch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exposure to the realities of the universe can crack the ordinary notions of our world and make it all seem a little beside the point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Try this for a Zen concept: Fairall, associate professor at the University of Cape Town (UCT), was part of a team of astronomers who recently located a rich cluster of galaxies in a region of the universe dubbed &quot;the Great Attractor&quot;. Our galaxy and our neighbouring galaxies are all streaming towards it at the speed of 600km/ second, but with no danger of collision - it is moving away from us at the even faster rate of 5 000km/second.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where is it going? Why are we chasing it? And why so fast?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fairall smiles gently. &quot;Actually, by cosmological standards, 600 kilometres a second is quite sedate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our galaxy is moving towards the attractor because of gravity - such a large clump of cosmic matter exerts a pull on its neighbours, drawing galaxies after it as it moves through space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fairall compares the movements of the universe to a currant cake baking in an oven. As the cake gets bigger, the currants move away from each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The baking cake phenomenon is a result of how the universe began. Fairall says that, scientifically, the accepted way as to how the universe began is the &quot;Big Bang&quot; theory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the beginning, everything was very dense - and all that we know of in the universe was confined into a very small volume,&quot; he says. &quot;The volume grew explosively larger - much like a bomb going off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is still doing that today, though more slowly. Some of the material in the volume - originally very hot gas - cooled into galaxies, while the space between the galaxies is still expanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over and above this cosmological expansion, astronomers have long been aware of the streaming of galaxies towards a particular region, but until earlier this year there had always been a blank spot on the map that the &quot; Great Attractor&quot; now occupies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was partly because the region is somewhat obscured by the Milky Way.  Galaxies, Fairall explains, are like towns or villages - a vast number of suns and their satellites bunched together and surrounded by dark matter.  They are separated from each other by empty space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shape of a galaxy is usually disc-like - a spiral or coil of material - and our galaxy is typical in this respect. Our solar system is not at the centre of the galaxy, but off to one side, and the Milky Way, seen only from the Southern Sky, is the bulk of our galaxy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trying to look beyond and through it is like trying to see through the high- rises and suburban ridges of a city to the area beyond. Fairall and UCT student Patrick Woudt worked with four international astronomers to map what was behind the Milky Way, using a whole-sky photographic survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photographs were magnified 50 times and then carefully scrutinised to separate the stars of the Milky Way from what lay further out in space. This is a painstaking process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Fairall points out, the photographs are two-dimensional and don't have depth, so they show galaxies next to each that might be quite far apart. To find out how far from us each galaxy or star was, Fairall and Woudt used the telescope at the South African observatory at Sutherland. He would look at each galaxy, and from the spread of colours it produced work out the distance of the galaxy from us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This process was also used by Fairall's colleagues at European observatories based in South America, and it unearthed more than 10 000 previously obscured galaxies. The observations enabled the astronomers to calculate the size and mass of the &quot;Great Attractor&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of the research is Dr Ren_e Kraan-Korteweg, of the observatory of Paris- Meudon, who began collaborating with Fairall in 1991. He has visited the Sutherland observatory several times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Great Attractor&quot; is 300-million light years away. This makes the discovery historic in another sense - not only a modern event, but a phenomenon of the past. Light takes time to travel across distance. This time is negligible when the light is coming to us from the moon, but as the distance increases, time becomes history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Fairall and his team have mapped and seen is 300-million years old.  The &quot;Great Attractor&quot; may look somewhat different from what the telescopes have made visible to us, but we will only know what those differences are 300- million years from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This makes mapping the universe increasingly a process of mapping the past as astronomers reach further and further out into the universe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technology of the Hubble telescope has made the furthest areas of the universe visually accessible and, in covering this immense distance, has crossed the divide of history to show the origins of the universe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lifetime of the universe is around 15- billion years, so when astronomers start to look at a distance of 15-billion light years away - whatever direction they point the telescope - they no longer see stars and galaxies, but clouds of opaque gases. Those are the materials from which a universe grows, and what astronomers are seeing is the beginning of its life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's as if we are an egg, surrounded by shell,&quot; says Fairall. The map of the universe, seen from above in a God's eye- view, is therefore a circle, with our galaxy right at its centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beyond this line are licorice allsorts,&quot; Fairall quips, pointing to the circular boundary. &quot;And no one can prove any different.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - While the UN reconsiders its mission in Angola, the SADC is rethinking its own obligations there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Security Council will decide this week whether to extend its costly operation to maintain Angola's fragile peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, fears that the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Organ on Politics, Defence and Security set up to promote peace in the region is not achieving results in Angola, have led to calls for South African President Nelson Mandela and Mozambican President Joachim Chissano to take the lead in pushing for peace in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The calls, made privately to the Mail &amp; Guardian by Western diplomats, followed the first SADC peace summit on Angola held last week in Luanda. The summit was attended by several Southern African presidents and was intended to bring together President Jos_ Eduardo dos Santos and Uniaco Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola (Unita) opposition leader Jonas Savimbi.  However, Savimbi failed to attend, claiming he had not been given enough notice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit went ahead, however, and focused on what initiatives regional leaders should take in achieving peace in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign diplomats in South Africa this week expressed confidence that Chissano has had the appropriate experience of bringing peace to Mozambique after a long civil war and because Mozambique, like Angola, was colonised by the Portugese, has empathy with the Angolan culture. They also described Mandela as having the presence and conciliatory skills to bring Savimbi and Dos Santos together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Aziz Pahad said this week that now that South Africa was the head of the SADC Mandela will play a more &quot;reinforced&quot; role in Angola. However he added Mandela's input would be made through the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official in the Department of Foreign Affairs said South Africa will &quot; play a more active role&quot; but did not want to be seen to supplant regional efforts. He said: &quot;Mugabe was the chair of the Frontline States for a long time and was chosen to head the SADC organ. So Mandela is very sensitive and careful not to be seen to be steamrolling the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SADC summit last week chose three presidents - Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, Chissano and Zambia's Frederick Chiluba - to increase pressure on the ruling party, the Movimento Popular de Libertacao de Angola (MPLA) and Unita, to overcome the final hurdles to peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both Unita and the MPLA have privately let it be known progress would be swifter if Mandela and Chissano rather than Mugabe were at the helm of the regional effort to halt the growing anarchy in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern African countries fear the United Nations' Angola Verification Mission (Unavem) mandate may not be extended if the peace process is seen to be leading nowhere, and have sent five foreign ministers to New York this week to lobby for an extension to Unavem. It is costing the the UN R4,5- million a day for the upkeep of its forces in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Angolan embassy representative in Pretoria, Jorge Morais, said he would be happy with Mandela and Chissano taking the lead in calling for the MPLA and Unita to sort out their differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We welcome that iniative,&quot; Morais said. &quot;In our region we identify Mr Mandela as a respectable man who is in a good position to address the problems of Angola.We believe that Mr Mandela and Mr Chissano have the experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An adviser to Savimbi in South Africa, who asked not to be named, said: &quot; Savimbi is very keen on having Presidents Mandela and Chissano take the lead.  They made miracles happen in their respective countries ... If Mandela and Chissano fail, then we are doomed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Angolans have implemented most points of the Lusaka Protocol, a peace agreement signed by the MPLA and Unita in 1994, which specified among other things that both parties participate in a government of national unity and reconciliation, and that they demobilise their troops and create a unified army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Lusaka Protocol, Unita would fill four Cabinet posts, and Savimbi would become vice-president to Dos Santos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savimbi later reversed his decision and went back on the agreement to become vice-president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now Savimbi is reportedly reconsidering accepting the position of vice- president as pressure mounts from the UN, which has threatened sanctions against either or both of the Angolan parties if they impede the progress of the protocol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of trust between the two parties remains the major obstacle to peace.  Although Unita has said it has demobilised its 62 000 forces in quartering areas monitored by the UN, a Unita insider said this week that about 10 000 of Unita's top soldiers are elsewhere in Angola, on alert in case the peace flounders. Unita has also accused MPLA forces of moving into positions vacated by its forces instead of going into military barracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unita has, however, recently sent some of its generals to Luanda to be integrated into the Forcas Armadas Angolanas, the unified Angolan army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savimbi remains in his headquarters at Bailundo and his advisers say lack of trust is still the central and most deep-seated problem affecting progress towards multi- party government in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are growing fears in the region that progress is so slow, and the peace so shallow, that war could once again break out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Paul Muite has been accused of a few things in his time. There was the conspiracy to recolonise Kenya and the plot to overthrow the government. But the opposition leader and other members of Kenya's elite are braced for a new charge: consorting with the devil. And the government has an official commission to prove it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya is falling apart. Crime and corruption are booming. Most Kenyans see little hope for the future and blame the government. Yet President Daniel arap Moi would have Kenyans believe the real threats are imaginary guerrilla groups, manipulated tribal violence and devil worshippers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, amid a flourish of press reports of children kidnapped for ritual sacrifice, Arap Moi appointed Kenya's archbishop to head an official commission into devil worship. The report was completed last month. Arap Moi has refused to release it, but the government has issued a warning that Lucifer's followers abound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission says devil worshippers have brought a plague of human sacrifice, cannibalism, &quot;incantations in unintelligible language&quot; and rape of children - and gives hints on how to spot Lucifer's agents at work. Citizens should look out for the &quot;magic horns of witchcraft&quot;, the numbers 666, images of witches on broomsticks, nudity and snakes. Other giveaways are an &quot; obsession with sex, especially lesbianism or homosexuality&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonifes Adoyo, a member of the commission and senior pastor of the Nairobi Pentecostal Church, says it found devil worship at every level of society but mostly among the elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The elites entice people into it with money,&quot; Adoyo said. &quot;Materialism and affluence do not answer spiritual longings ... they want mystical powers to control people.&quot; He said those who have &quot;joined the bandwagon of economic and political freedoms&quot; played into the hands of devil worshippers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muite thinks he knows exactly who the commission is talking about - Arap Moi's political opponents. &quot;Moi won't release the report, but it won't be long before he says it names his enemies as devil worshippers. I know from statements of those around the president that I am one of the people he would like to use the report to destroy,&quot; Muite said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president has often resorted to scaremongering to distract from the shortcomings of his rule. Before the 1992 presidential elections, the first free vote in decades, the government whipped up ethnic killings, which it blamed on the coming of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new campaign before next year's elections, the government has accused neighbouring Uganda of training a rebel army for invasion. Last month Arap Moi produced three alleged rebels he said were part of a plot to kill him.  The three were promised a pardon if they confessed. Two did so, though the family of one said he had been bought off. A third agreed to confess but changed his mind; soon after, he was killed in a police car when it was rammed by a goods train; he was the only fatality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The puzzle surrounding possible South African involvment in a United States satellite phone system took another twist this week when it emerged the system might not be geared to work above South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report compiled by the University of Colorado indicates the Ellipso satellite phone system will not function south of 20 degrees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, according to an Internet document compiled by the Bradley Department of Electrical Engineering at the Virginia Polytechnic and State University, Ellipsat CEO David Castiel has said: &quot;Frankly, my business plan can do without the people on Easter Island. The university says the system is designed to cover 'more populated areas'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was reported at the weekend that a group of South African companies - including Vula Communications, in which Sanco Investments Holdings has a 40% stake and various unions - had pledged R1,6-billion towards the Ellipso satellite phone system. Papers before the Federal Commuications Commission presented the consortium as being backed by the African National Congress and trade unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vula Commuications head Mark Headbush told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week that as far as he understood, the system will work in this country.  Suggestions to the contrary were probably the result of &quot;propoganda&quot; directed against Ellipso because it was &quot;driven by blacks&quot;. He suggested the M&amp;G contact Ellipsat in the US, which could not be reached for comment at the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Virginia Polytechnic, Ellipsat is up against the Iridium system developed by Motorola, which will be able to cover the globe by cross- linking its satellites.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The South African National Civics Organisation (Sanco) has stopped throwing stones and is going into business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radical anti-apartheid civic organisation is poised to move into the heart of capitalism when it branches out into direct insurance, marketing and advertising in the next two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This shift into the business world comes a year after Sanco, which spearheaded opposition to apartheid's &quot;puppet&quot; local governments in townships, set up its own independent investment company, Sanco Investments Holdings, which operates from offices in Sandton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanco's move into insurance and marketing is aimed at building up a solid membership which will give the investment company the &quot;people's company&quot; status it needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men behind the transition - former Sanco president Moses Mayekiso and businessman Michael Levinsohn - have been plotting the quiet revolution since 1993, when it became apparent Sanco's role would have to change with the arrival of a democratic government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political changeover deprived the organisation of its foreign funding and left it isolated - a marginalisation Levinsohn and Mayekiso intend to eradicate as they launch an ambitious scheme to rebuild Sanco membership and capitalise on foreign and local companies' appetite for politically correct &quot; empowerment&quot; partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan is that profits from Sanco's business operations and from the investment company will ultimately flow back into development projects and black empowerment schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had to turn Sanco into a product, an empowerment organ,&quot; says Mayekiso, who is also a former head of the National Union of Metalworkers and a member of the African National Congress's national executive committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of the year, Sanco intends to issue membership cards -credit cards with magnetic stripes - to its existing members in exchange for a R30 annual membership fee. Mayekiso estimates the existing membership base is about 1,2-million. Members will also receive a book of coupons offering them discounts for goods from about eight companies, including Tiger Oats and Ster Kinekor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been offering them a new marketing opportunity. We will be harnessing the buying power of the existing Sanco membership base.&quot; In return, the companies pay for printing the coupons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the Mayekiso and Levinsohn mantra that Sanco and Sanco Investment Holdings have a separate, if symbiotic relationship, they talk about both in the same business tongue. &quot;When we talk to a business like Tiger Oats, we represent two things. We are a mass-based black empowerment company. We genuinely represent people. But we can also participate in the financial arena as contractual partners. We bring something else to the table that nobody else can claim: we are a people's company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most daring part of the scheme is that they plan to use the barcoded coupons to build up a market-research data base which they will sell. &quot;It will be a highly accurate market-research tool.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the boon of the various discounts, members will get life insurance (R1 000 for funeral expenses and R1 500 a year for up to three children for three years). For an extra R10 a month additional insurance will be available from electronic &quot;speedpoints&quot; at Sanco offices around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next month Mayekiso and Levisohn will fly to New York to give a presentation to United States insurance group AIG - which is also backing the life-assurance scheme - in a bid to bring &quot;direct insurance&quot; to Sanco members.  If they succeed, Sanco members will be the first South Africans with access to direct insurance, which cuts out the middle man by allowing customers to phone through their insurance requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayekiso insists he has not abandoned his socialist roots: &quot;I am more a socialist than ever. The only shift is that we now have to look for a new way of effecting empowerment. Before we just had to throw stones ... We are now facing the reality that we cannot depend on rhetoric any more. We have to shift from throwing stones to using stones to build foundations for the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1989 Mayekiso was tried for treason for his work with the Alexandra Action Committee. Perhaps the only amusing aspect of his trial was that the authorities allowed him to build up a substantial library of Marxist literature in his prison cell at Diepkloof, south of Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayekiso says the shift into business was vital. &quot;We have to resort to these empowerment projects in order that Sanco can have a role and survive.  Sanco has to survive as it is a crucial structure if we are to democratise our society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levinsohn's main job has been to get the investment company on the road. He arranged R1,5-million in start-up capital from insurance giant Liberty Life.  A further R2-million came from Dato Samsudings's Malaysian holding company SMG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayekiso says Sanco Investments Holdings concentrates on investments which will promote black empowerment. Its portfolio includes a 26% stake in Vula Communications Group, which could become a key investor in a US satellite phone company; 20% in Powerlib, a &quot;shell&quot; company talking to Sasol and Engen about a possible black empowerment fuel operation; 20% of Solid Gold Commercial Radio, which is applying for a broadcast licence; and 51% in Price Tag Wholesalers, a door-to-door sales company started by Sanco. Levinsohn does not like to talk figures, beyond saying these investments should start yielding returns in three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Vula Communications's possible involvement in the satellite deal which recently put Sanco's business affairs in the spotlight. Since the Sunday Times broke the story, it has emerged that the satellite system is not geared to function above South Africa - a fact which does not bother Levisohn.  He shrugs it off:&quot;The reality of technology today is that technoogy is universally applicable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The link between Sanco and the investment company is the Sanco Development Trust, on whose board sits Mayekiso, Levinsohn and other Sanco executives.  Levinsohn says the trust's share of profits from the company will be distributed to regional Sanco offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's link with development is the Ilima Community Development Company, which has won a R1-million tender from the Reconstruction and Development Programme office in the Eastern Cape. Levinsohn says the company also plans to make money by offering, for a fee, expertise on local communities to companies keen to invest in rural areas. &quot;We will be an integral part of the communication channel between communities and business&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, it is targeting government projects like the Maputo Development Corridor. It will charge small fees to communities which use the facilities it develops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayekiso has already lined up Swedish phone company Ericsson as a 6,6% shareholder in Ilima, and is looking for other multinational companies to take shares. &quot;Ericsson has identified Ilima as a means of making true empowerment on the ground a reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayekiso concedes that Sanco Investments Holdings depends on a substantial, established Sanco membership if it is to present itself as an authentic mass- based company. Apart from an initial 1,2-million from Sanco's existing base, he hopes to attract about a million new members a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the pilot project in the Eastern Cape is anything to go by, he might be on to a winner - 800 of the 2 000 residents of the village of Xalanga have signed up to the new Sanco and paid their R30 joining fee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africa youngest national student organisation believes it has discovered a pool of support among campus students weary of &quot;struggle&quot; politics. Oddly, for South Africa, it is a mainly white organisation with a black leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Liberal Students' Association (Salsa) promotes individualism, as opposed to collectivism. This, says its newly elected national president, Enoch Ngcongolo, is just what students need in the new political order.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salsa, formed in November 1994, advocates liberalism of student politics by encouraging freedoms - of the individual, of expression, of association. &quot;We believe you first have to heal the individual before you heal the society.&quot; Ngcongolo maintains the forced collectivism of the liberation struggle is failing on campuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that he is probably the first black to lead a mainly white student group, he adds, shows that liberalism pays no attention to colour, only the individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngcongolo (21), a second-year BComm student at Rhodes University, was elected to the organisation's federal executive as vice- president less than six months after joining as a member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a former member of the Congress of South African Students (Cosas), a secondary- school organisation whose members usually graduate to the South African Students' Congress (Sasco). He became dissatisfied with the &quot; irrational radicalism&quot; of Cosas, Sasco and the African National Congress Youth League while at high school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngcongolo says individualism and freedom of speech and association are becoming more appealing to students, who are tired of extremist campus politics. &quot;We believe, for example, in redressing the imbalances of the past.  We address issues affecting both blacks and whites, but we are steering a middle path on these common issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salsa is already digging into the support of established student groups only two years after its formation. It beat Sasco, the country's largest student body, in the latest Student Representative Council elections at the University of the Witwatersrand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salsa has branches on 13 campuses, including the University of the Western Cape, University of Cape Town, University of Fort Hare, Rand Afrikaans University, University of the Orange Free State and three technical colleges in Norhern Province. This is a small feat compared to Sasco's presence at 150 tertiary institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On black campuses Salsa is often perceived as a &quot;puppet&quot; of the Democratic Party. &quot;Some people don't want to see us as a purely liberal student organisation,&quot; says Ngcongolo. &quot;We are not aligned to any political party whatsoever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mistrust does not only come from outside the organisation. Ngcongolo admits that even within Salsa &quot;cultural and racial&quot; tensions exist. &quot;There is a lack of trust from both sides, and I think that is because I am new in this position. It is not really a question of racism ... We are also trying to do away with the belief that liberalism is a white thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The government is to lift its two-year ban on recruiting new police officers following a public outcry over escalating violent crime and the continued haemorrhaging of manpower from the South African Police Service (SAPS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first batch of candidates is expected to start training early next year, ending a moratorium police claim has left them inadequately placed to fight crime in many regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maxwell Mulaudzi, a representative for Safety and Security Minister Sidney Mufamadi, said the minister was still waiting for a proposal from the SAPS's human resources department about manpower requirements. &quot;Once he has that then he will be better placed to put a plan before the Cabinet for consideration within budgetary constraints.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi, who has often argued that putting more police on the streets would not necessarily reduce crime, is under pressure from businessmen and the diplomatic community to do more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime is widely believed to be a major obstacle in the country's democratic and economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Police Commissioner George Fivaz would like the moratorium lifted immediately. He is also demanding extra funds to beef up logistical support, such as more vehicles, which he says will be the &quot;decisive factor in beating crime&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Pretoria West Police College, tutors say the rumour mills have been turning with news that their first lot of new cadets could be on board for January 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The college, which once put through about 6000 new officers a year, now relies on retraining programmes for the SAPS personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Superintendent Fanie Bierman, head of training, said that like most police colleges it was now so under-utilised it was difficult to justify keeping facilities going. Two have already closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a new method of teaching which is in line with a democratic country, but only 1 700 people were given this training during a pilot programme last year,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are now out in the system like little fish in a sea full of sharks.  We need to get more officers through the programme in order to make a significant impact on policing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the SAPS as a bath full of water where the plug is releasing water (that is, officers killed, retired or retrenched), but the tap is tightly closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official figures show that 2 503 police left the service from the beginning of 1995 to July 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The parlous state of the South African Police Service was underlined yet again this week with the release of figures showing that more people escaped from police custody this year than from all the country's prisons put together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics released by the government showed that nearly 1 000 violent criminals - including murderers, armed robbers and hijackers - escaped from police cells in the first eight months of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Escape from police custody is not difficult, it seems - especially in Mmabatho, North- West province, where 18 prisoners bolted for freedom when their cell doors were left open in five separate incidents over the eight- month period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to escapees, more than 5 000 convicted criminals absconded while on parole. This represents nearly 19% of all convicts given parole.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attention has been drawn to escapes from police custody and parole-breakers by the disclosure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one case, convicted murderer David Ruiters was released on parole and then implicated last week as a member of a five- man prison gang accused of murdering two women and a child in Niewoudtville in the Western Cape. Another gang member is awaiting trial for murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police are unable to give a detailed breakdown of the crimes for which 957 prisoners - who escaped while in police custody this year- had been charged. Only 284 have been re-arrested. Out of a total prison population of more than 120 000, 892 convicted prisoners escaped during the same period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prison overcrowding forces many prisoners awaiting trial to be kept in police cells, that are not designed to handle the quantity or calibre of the criminals. The prisons, constructed for a population of about 95 000, must accommodate 122 330 prisoners, a quarter of whom are still unsentenced or awaiting trial. The prison population has risen from 111 798 in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In more than one instance police officers have been overpowered when dealing with the vastly overcrowded communal holding cells. Police were also unable to determine how several escapes were effected. Figures for previous years have not been compiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the biggest break-out, using one of the most common means of escape, 61 prisoners escaped through the roof of the Brakpan prison in the East Rand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from really serious criminals, few prisoners will complete their sentences inside prisons, correctional services representative Koos Gerber said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first eight months of the year 29 387 prisoners were placed on parole and 5 479 absconded. Gerber was unable to provide exact details of the crimes these abscondees were accused of committing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correctional Services Portfolio Committee chairman Carl Niehaus said the causes behind the overburdening of prisons stem as much from problems in the Safety and Security and Justice departments as they do from the range of factors affecting correctional services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the present prisons are mostly outdated and overcrowded, with Pollsmoor Prison overpopulated by about 200%, five new prisons - to house 5 000 prisoners - are expected to be completed by November next year.  Upgradings and renovations on existing structures are also under way. However, Niehaus said: &quot;I don't think we will ever build ourselves out of the problem.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes the Correctional Services Department needs to reprioritise and find ways of achieving more within its budgetary constraints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also at the heart of the overburdened prison system, he said, are severe staff problems - from corruption and a manpower shortage of 6 000 people, to poor morale caused by uncertainty over affirmative action or anger that it is not being phased in fast enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Absenteeism among prison warders is also a problem. This was most notably seen when three Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging bombers escaped from Diepkloof prison, Soweto, in March when only five of the 17 warders reported for duty - a comprehensive report of which has still not been presented to Niehaus. But according to the National Institute of Crime Prevention and Rehabilitation of Offenders,the lot of prisoners has not improved. Rapes are a regular occurrence in many jails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inhumane living conditions, chronic overcrowding and the resultant lack of quality of life make rehabilitation almost impossible, said senior social worker Zeenith Domingo-Kahn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And prisons have become &quot;recruiting agencies&quot;, where minor criminals find their way into prison gangs, and are an &quot;organising base&quot; where further crimes are planned, said Wits University Professor Robin Lee, who compiled the Nedcor anti- crime report. Only 6% of prisoners do not return to jail, he added, with the other 94% making the South African recidivism rate - where perpetrators continuously return to jail - one of the world's highest. Lee pointed to a more selective parole selection procedures and the need to build more prisons as two solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separation of hardened and minor criminals is necessary to ensure rehabilitation, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Niehaus said the building of maximum security prisons for hardened criminals is on the cards, as is a proper complaints mechanism to deal with corruption allegations against warders, such as the involvement of the public protector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, he said, an inspecting judge is to be appointed as an independent investigative authority.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Britain is once again eyeing South Africa as a market for some major defence machinery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should Cabinet decide to buy four second-hand submarines from Britain - at the bargain price of R2-billion - it may well find the deal to be a sweetener.  London is hoping the cheap subs will soften South Africa for a much larger basket of arms orders bearing the &quot;made in Britain&quot; stamp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top on Britain's wish list is an attempt to revive Yarrow shipyard's bid to build the South African Navy four corvette patrol craft, a scaled-down version of the frigate warship. Yarrow was shortlisted alongside Spain's Bazan shipyard in late 1994 to supply the corvettes, but Defence Minister Joe Modise put the procurement on hold after an outcry over the cost.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bazan's cheaper bid would have amounted to about R1,7-billion (at present exchange rates more than R2,2-billion) for the hulls alone. The British offer was 30 to 40% more expensive and had a less enticing counter- trade component.  Now indications are that the tender process will be reopened and that the British government is hoping to use the cheap submarines as a bargaining chip on behalf of Yarrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyed equally eagerly by the British is what promises to be post-apartheid South Africa's largest defence procurement contract by far. The South African Air Force (SAAF) wants to replace its ageing Impala jet trainers, and the front-runner in the unofficial bidding appears to be the British Hawk, described in British military literature as &quot;an excellent trainer, but also a credible offensive support aircraft&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The price tag for more than 40 Hawks, the number the SAAF is interested in, could well exceed R4-billion. Counting in favour of the Hawks is that Zimbabwe and Kenya, two key allies should South Africa venture into joint African operations, already use Hawks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament's defence committee was briefed this week by the navy on its most pressing equipment needs. Both the submarines and the corvettes appear on the list. Committee chair Tony Yengeni said his committee would meet again later this month to decide whether to recommend the submarine purchase, but would not give more details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a defence analyst close to committee members said there appeared to be support from African National Congress, Inkatha Freedom Party and National Party members of Parliament for the submarine deal, and also for the corvettes to be put back on the navy's shopping list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should the committee give the go-ahead, it would free Armscor, as the state arms procurement agency, and the navy to enter detailed negotiations. Once these are complete, Cabinet would still have to give final approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence experts were unanimous this week that the four British diesel- electric Upholder submarines are excellent value for money - the price tag of 300-million (just over R2-billion) for all four is a third what it cost the Royal Navy to have them developed and built - but that South Africa's need for them as well as its ability to pay were not as clear. The amount will be payable over 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Bachelor, co-ordinator of the Centre for Conflict Resolution's arms watch programme, said: &quot;If Parliament and Cabinet decide yes, then it will be a good deal. (But) the question we need to be asking ourselves, quite apart from affordability ... is do we really need the submarines? I would say it is much more important to invest in maritime patrol aircraft, and how to co- ordinate a coastal patrol.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bachelor said he had indications the British had made no formal link between the Upholder offer and the corvettes - something they had come to regret - but that it still appeared to be a sweetener for the corvette and Hawk contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Built in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Upholders were decommissioned soon after because of British defence cuts and a decision to channel available resources to nuclear submarines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Richard Sharpe, editor of Jane's Fighting Ships said: &quot;The British government has been trying to get rid of them for three years. Canada was the preferred choice, but Canada is heading towards disarmament by a series of defence budget cuts. (The Upholders) are an embarrassment to the British government, so no doubt whoever gets them will get them at a bargain price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it &quot;would make sense&quot; if the British government was trying to use the cheap price tag as a sweetener for other deals like the corvettes. But he said there was &quot;nothing strange&quot; about that. &quot;Offset is now accepted internationally as a way to acquire defence procurement contracts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigadier Bill Sass of the Institute for Defence Policy said the Upholder offer was &quot;a good price for a good product&quot;, but that there were probably strings attached - specifically in relation to the corvette and Hawk deals. &quot; The exact deal is never made public ... The small print only the governments will know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said contracts of this nature included the supply of parts and personnel training, as well as negotiations over payment schedules and currency exchange rates. Once South Africa decided on buying the submarines, it may be tempted by the logic of equipment standardisation and more favourable package deals to favour Yarrow's corvette bid and other British supply contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a senior member of South Africa's military procurement establishment said: &quot;I don't think Parliament will give money for both the corvettes and the submarines. My feeling is if we can get both, excellent. But go to the populace and say there will be no houses and no schools, what do think they'll do? They'll laugh at us ... It is an excellent deal, but something is only excellent if you want it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the corvettes, which had been on the navy's shopping list for about a decade already, were a much more urgent priority. The navy could still extend the lifespan of its three French-built Daphne class submarines until 2005 - which had been the intention before Britain made the Upholder offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said while he did not believe the Upholders were a sweetener for the corvette deal - the British know they cannot compete with the Spanish, for example - it was rather an attempt to sell submarines instead of corvettes.  This would ensure that the South African navy is brought closer to the British standard, which could have future spin-offs in defence co-operation and procurement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence consultant Helmoed R&quot;mer Heitman, who is also South African correspondent for Jane's Defence Weekly, pointed out that another factor behind the Upholder &quot;sweetener&quot; may be Britain's desire for open access to Simonstown and Durban naval bases. He said Chile was still interested in the Upholders - and appeared to have made an offer that exceeded the price at which they were offered to South Africa - but the British had less to win from them by way of offset benefit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africans seeking fortunes in Angola's fabled diamond fields have fallen foul of the government's crackdown on illegal immigrants as the ruling party, the MPLA, tries to prove it has stopped using South African mercenaries in ongoing skirmishes against the opposition, Unita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one reason given by the Angolan government for what has looked like xenophobia following arrests of hundreds of foreigners recently, including scores of South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Angolan government has said that all the South Africans arrested and deported back to South Africa had failed to fulfil immigration requirements.  But most of those deported said they were in possession of legal documents and that they were being wrongfully targeted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Angolan official in the Pretoria embassy, Jorge Morais, denied South Africans were specific targets. He said: &quot;We have been accused by Unita of continuing to use mercenaries, therefore we are making sure that they don't complain about us using foreigners. We are also in the process of organising society, so we have to make sure that foreigners meet our immigration requirements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Angolan government employed former South African Defence Force soldiers, through the Pretoria-based company Executive Outcomes, to train its troops after Unita went back to war after losing the 1992 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those arrested and then deported from Angola in the latest drive against foreigners were about 40 members of the British mining company Branch Energy. Some of the men are South Africans and had previously worked for Executive Outcomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week's arrests of former spy Craig Williamson and four more South African diamond miners added to the confusion about aliens being detained in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African ambassador to Luanda Roger Ballard-Tremeer said they were arrested in an Angolan government operation called Cancer II &quot;to rid the country of undesirable foreigners who are plundering the Angolan economy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four diamond miners have been set free and would be deported back to South Africa this week, Ballard-Tremeer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Williamson remained in prison, Ballard- Tremeer said, although he had learnt about this from his own sources, and not officially. &quot;We are still trying to find out what Craig is in for and we believe he will be there for a while.&quot; He said the Angolan authorities &quot;haven't even told us that he's there (in jail)&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Angolan official was quoted on South African radio saying Williamson was arrested because he was trading while on a tourism visa. But Ballard-Tremeer said it was unlikely Williamson's documents were not in order because he had been doing business in Angola and had been travelling in and out of the country since 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several of the South Africans who were arrested and deported told the M&amp;G this week that the arrests of foreigners points to the confusion and corruption of the Angolan immigration system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ballard-Tremeer said some South Africans had obtained what they may have thought were valid work permits from Angolan immigration officials inside the country, but that these were not valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the only valid permits were issued to foreigners at Angola's diplomatic missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gert Potgieter from White River was among 18 South Africans working in the diamond fields who was deported from Angola last month. He said he had obtained his work permit in Pretoria before he left, but was still arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potgieter said he has since been told by the Angolan embassy in Pretoria he was now welcome back in Angola. He had decided to &quot;return soon&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Warm sun chased the shadows from the hills around Mandini on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast last Sunday, but all that lit the main rondawel of the Shandu kraal was the glimmer of a single white candle burned in memory of the two young men gunned down there last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women mourning on straw mats in the dark room stopped to re-enact the the 30-minute shooting spree last Tuesday. Crouching on the floor to show how she saved five young children from the attackers who banged their weapons on the rondawel door, the grieving mother, Theresa Shandu, scowled at a mention of the peace initiative announced four months ago in the blood-soaked province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political leaders, she said, &quot;like to talk about peace and happiness, but it's only because their busy bribing each other. What kind of peace is this?&quot; she demanded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her 20-year-old son Petersen Shandu died after a bullet pierced his neck.  He had been playing cards with his brothers when he was shot. Sbongiseni (18) died in a hail of bullets trying to escape into the darkness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their brother Bongkosi and neighbour Thili managed to elude the gunmen, while Sonny-Boy hid behind the door and watched a man who threatened to kill him two days earlier search the room with a torch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was down by the river last Sunday when he shouted to me that 'We're coming to shoot you because you are amaqabane (comrades) and we don't need amaqabane in this part of KwaZulu',&quot; Sonny-Boy recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mourning women said the alleged attack leader - an Inkatha Freedom Party leader from a neighbouring tribal area, out on bail for a massacre in town last year - named three families in the area when he issued his threat: &quot; They marked all the ANC (African National Congress) in the area. We are afraid. Please bring the SANDF (South African National Defence Force) here.  They are our only hope,&quot; they pleaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survivors say they do not trust the police, who failed to take their statements last week, instructing them to appear at the former KwaZulu Police station in the nearby ANC-dominated township of Sundumbili: &quot;We don't believe the police at Sundumbili want to find the truth. There are so many cases that happen here and we tell them who is causing the trouble but they don't do anything. If they catch someone we see him out again after a short time,&quot; charged Sonny-Boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not the first time such charges have been levelled by ANC supporters.  Earlier last Tuesday, Moses Gumede was shot dead in his driveway. It took two day before police from Empangeni came to take a statement from his wife Jabu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local police on the scene picked up the empty cartridges &quot;with their bare hands&quot;, drew no markers on the pavement and took no pictures of the bloody scene, she said. The slain Gumede, a former Cosatu shop steward, had been a witness to an IFP-aligned co- worker's murder of his own daughter earlier this year, allegedly during an attempt to shoot his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent police audit belies the suggestion that police are simply over- stretched and under-staffed. Sundumbili, unlike most stations in the province, is over-staffed, with 156 uniformed members to the recommended 63, including three times the recommended sergeants and constables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perceptions of police bias and inefficiency are compounded by the presence of at least 10 Caprivi trainees at the station, whose names and ranks from constable to detective- sergeant were confirmed this week by the station commander, Superintendent Mandla Mchunu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban Supreme Court Judge Nick van der Reyden last year ordered an investigation into cover-up allegations levelled at Mchunu by one of three self-confessed hit-squad members in the Esikhawini hit-squad trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Network of Independent Monitors north coast field-worker Anton Pestana said the policing situation in the area was aggravated by the recent withdrawal of a Public Order Policing Unit (Popu) based in the neighbouring industrial town of Isithebe: &quot;People had begun to trust this unit, but now they have returned to their Mtubatuba base. Other members of the unit are now patrolling the area and they are allegedly working together with local self-protection units under the leadership of IFP councillor Robert Mdletshe,&quot; he said. Repeated allegations of torture have been levelled against members of the Mtubatuba- based Popu, known as Unit 33, but no action has been taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pestana said the unit was now perceived to be assisting IFP elements intent on consolidating the party's support, with refugees fleeing two IFP-led tribal areas to the virtually empty land of chief Jeffrey Ncgobo: &quot;Most of the displacees are not fleeing the SPUs as much as fleeing Popu. We have witness reports of white men with black painted faces taking part in attacks together with SPUs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative of the north coast National Investigation Task Unit (NITU) assigned to probe political violence in the area confirmed the reports, and said the &quot;old networks returned to their activities&quot; during the three-month absence of unit leader Captain Mandlenkosi Vilikazi, who was cleared last month of torture charges levelled by the IFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formed to counter allegations of police bias following a massacre of 11 people in Isithebe last year, Vilikazi's unit had brought relative calm to the area in its first months of operation. Last month the unit was on the verge of collapse under the leadership of four white policemen assigned to the unit in Vilikazi's absence, the representative said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Suspects were granted bail without consultation, and people again became afraid to report cases. It would seem as though it's going to happen all over again. In fact it already has,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There are ominious warnings in KwaZulu-Natal that a major massacre could lie ahead if action is not taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four months since KwaZulu-Natal's political leaders declared their 14-year civil war &quot;over&quot;, people continue to die all over the province for their political allegiances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there are ominous signs that peaceful areas are beginning to degenerate.  Violence monitors warn the situation is ripening for another massacre. In recent weeks monitors say the comparatively low death statistics since the province's June local government elections mask dangerous currents in several corners of the troubled province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Committee said its September death toll of 34 marked only a &quot;slight&quot; increase on the 25 deaths recorded in August, but Natal Violence monitor Mary de Haas said at least 148 people died in politically related violence in the past three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Network of Independent Monitors director Jenni Irish said the figures were &quot; still unacceptable&quot; and warned that a failure to act now against a gradual increase would lay the groundwork for a major massacre: &quot;There are ominous signs in many areas of the province. Attacks are taking place in areas that were previously quiet, places that have become quiet following investigations have experienced new violence as suspects are released on bail, paramilitary training is continuing and the flow of illegal weapons has not abated,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irish said the recent violence in Mandini combined with other recent attacks in KwaMbonambi and as far north as Jozini to pose &quot;very worrying developments for the North Coast&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NIM's South Coast monitor Sylvan Chetty said the withdrawal of murder charges against eight suspects in the Shobashobane massacre case combined with the release on bail of several suspects to create renewed problems for the area: &quot;At least 12 people have died in Izingolweni over the past three months, bringing an end to the quiet that descended when the Shobashobane investigation got under way. Violence has also erupted in KwaXolo. Alarm bells must start ringing or we will face the possibility of another Shobashobane,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Probing the deaths of three people Tuesday in the previously quiet Midlands district of Inchanga, NIM's Midlands monitor Themba Sokhulu said four attacks in the area over the past three months had left four injured and three dead in a political conflict which apparently erupted over a soccer match between ANC and IFP members in IFP-dominated Tin Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While areas like Wembezi and Babanango have quieted down, we are worried about developments in Donnybrook, Fredville (Inchanga), and Bulwer. Other areas which could easily ignite are Mooi River, Mphophomeni and Taylors Halt,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Midlands accounted for 55% of the HRC's September death toll. NIM's Durban monitor Jabu Ngwane said while violence had dropped in many Durban townships, there were tremors around Entembeni in Umbumbulu and Malagazi outside Umlazi, where long-standing peace initiatives have broken down due to allegations of extortion on the past of a local induna and the utterances of local political leaders: &quot;As a result, development initiatives are being stalled and this is exacerbating tensions,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irish said this was a bad sign for the provincial peace initiative, as these moves should re-inforce local efforts: &quot;It's going to take more than a few handshakes and peace rallies. Almost every place where violence in continuing there are allegations about police involvement. The old networks are still in place and the political leaders have not addressed the security issues which are a pre-requisite to peace,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Haas warned against allowing the &quot;false lull&quot; in death statistics to breed complacency. Irish added that while the withdrawal of the 30 000 security force members deployed in the province to secure the election had been expected, recent reports that KwaZulu-Natal members were being sent to fight crime in other provinces was a grave mistake: &quot;I hope it will not take another massacre for people to realise this province remains a tinderbox.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The state's case against General Magnus Malan crumbled as the judge branded chief witness Captain JP Opperman a liar and acquited six Caprivi trainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Durban Supreme Court on Thursday, Judge Jan Hugo in his judgment said former Military Intelligence operative Captain JP Opperman's evidence was often contradictory, improbable or absurd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He criticised the state' other key witness, Andre Cloete, describing him as &quot;nondescript ... shabbily dressed ... and weak&quot;. Judge Hugo also described the main investigator in the trial, Colonel Frank Dutton, as a &quot;self- satisfied witness&quot; who gave irrelevant testimony.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Hugo attacked the heart of the state's evidence linking the SADF's covert Operation Marion to the massacre of 13 women and children in KwaMakhutha township in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Mail &amp; Guardian has established many of Inkatha's supporters trained through Operation Marion in the Caprivi strip are currently serving members of the security forces. The judge ruled,however, that six of these trainees were not guilty of murder</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is not disputed in the Malan case is 206 Inkatha supporters received paramilitary training under the auspices of Military Intelligence in 1986.  SAPS human resources spokes-man Superintendent Strini Moodley confirmed this week that at least 55 Caprivi trainees are serving in the South African Police Service - most of them in areas of KwaZulu-Natal which have suffered or continue to suffer from outbreaks of political violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G also established this week that another eight members listed in police computers as having resigned in 1988 are serving at the Sundumbili police station in strife-torn Mandini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ulundi has the largest concentration of &quot;Caprivis&quot; with 19 serving members, most of which serve in a &quot;guard unit&quot;, most likely the notorious VIP protection unit headed by Colonel Leonard Langeni who has featured in both the Transitional Executive Council's report on hitsquads and in testimony in the 1995 Esikhawini hit-squad trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four &quot;Caprivis&quot; are serving in Nongoma, which has suffered periodic violent outbreaks since 1994, three in Durban Point Road Public Order Policing Unit, three in Mpumalanga township, two in Nkandla, a KwaZulu-Natal village inflicted with alleged faction-fighting which has seen recent reflections in Gauteng mine violence, as well as two each in Newcastle, KwaMashu and the Vryheid Firearm Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Single Caprivi trainees are serving in Ndwedwe, Ubombo, Plessislaer, Bhekithemba, Nqutu, Esikhawini, Umlazi, Ezakheni, Mahlabatini, Izingolweni - the site of the 1995 Shobashobane massacre - and Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 51 other &quot;Caprivis&quot; are recorded as having resigned their posts as South African Police (SAP) &quot;visible policing constables&quot; between March and April of 1988. These are believed to form part of the estimated 130 &quot;Caprivis&quot; who were incorporated into the SAP as special constables after their 1987 training at Koeberg. Most of those listed in police records also formed part of a contingent of nearly 180 &quot;Caprivis&quot; who were incorporated into the KwaZulu Police in June 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of those who served in these former consigments and continue to do so are listed under different identification numbers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Eugene De Kock's autobiography, hand-written in his cell, is being kept under wraps by the colonel and his lawyers because it contains deeply personal details about the man who became apartheid's most ruthless killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It describes his upbringing in a right-wing family on a plot near Springs.  He attended the Baanbreker Primary School and the Voortrekker High School in Boksburg.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At high school he and his brother belonged to the Voortrekker movement and went to compulsory veld camps. Their father taught them to hunt. &quot;As a result of the camps in the veld and the experience of hunting and fishing, the accused developed a love for Africa and its wild animals. The bush was a safe haven for him,&quot; says the criminologist's report based on the autobiography.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the father, a hyper-macho image was important. He was a typical Afrikaner who belonged to a number of right-wing organisations. ... He was a member of the executive committee of the Broederbond ... In his work situation at the Department of Justice, the culture was one of smoking and drinking and talking of rugby. The children also came under the influence of this culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock did his national service in the army in 1967 with plans to enrol in the permanent force and do a B.Mil degree at Saldanha Bay. &quot;But the officers were determined just to break the servicemen physically and mentally. As a result of constant swearing by the officers, he decided to leave the SADF.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He joined the police in 1968 and was sent to Benoni after training at police college. In the same year he was called up for a counter-insurgency course, then fought with white security forces in what was then Rhodesia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He participated in a number of operations in Zimbabwe between 1968 and 1973.  After spending a few months in the State President's Guard, which he hated, he was sent back to Benoni. In 1976 he was heavily involved in suppressing student resistance to apartheid in townships on the East Rand and in 1977 was sent to Ovamboland as commander of a police base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1979, he was transferred to Koevoet in Oshakati and served in the notorious counter-insurgency unit until May 1983. Then he joined Section C1 of the police, the Vlakplaas unit that provided the base for a string of assassinations, murders and bombings that followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was arrested in May 1994 and held at the Adriaan Vlok Prison in Pretoria before being transferred to the Medium B section of Pretoria Central where he is currently waiting to be sentenced for multiple murder and fraud.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - That the 1980s bush war in Namibia and Angola was South Africa's Vietnam, a turning point in our history that left its mark in many different ways on the psyche of a generation of young men who went there, was reconfirmed by three different people I met this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One was a &quot;pathfinder&quot;, a commando dropped regularly behind enemy lines in Angola to do intelligence for South African Defence Force battalions that followed. On one sortie, he was shot in the shoulder with an AK-47. His helicopter unit abandoned him, another saved him and he woke up in hospital with a stutter that he still has. Today he spends his life writing about indigenous people of the kind he once fought.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another was in the armoured-car column that invaded Angola soon after the Movimento Popular de Libertacao de Angola (MPLA) took power in the mid-1970s.  Experiences there, including fierce battles and first-hand accounts of atrocities committed by his companions, resulted in him becoming a left- wing student and a vehement opponent of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is Colonel Eugene de Kock, whose testimony in court this week described why he and so many others who got embroiled in South Africa's bush wars chose another route: to become brutal defenders of the system that caused all the turmoil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anna van der Hoven, a professor in criminology at the University of South Africa, presented the first complete life story of the man described as apartheid's most accomplished assassin when she gave evidence in mitigation during De Kock's murder trial in the Pretoria Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing heavily on a 60-page autobiography written by De Kock in prison, she attempted to explain why the phenomenon she described as &quot;combat stress&quot; caused her client to respond to the trauma of war with violence rather than compassion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She described how De Kock, born on January 29 1949 in George, was brought up on a plot near Springs. His father, then a state prosecutor, was vehemently anti-communist and a member of the executive committee of the Broederbond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock senior ran the family with a rod of iron. He used physical punishment regularly and made it almost a family motto that it was cowardly to cry or show emotion. He frequently told his wife, who was more liberal and supported the United Party, that she should keep her mouth shut when they went out on social visits in case she embarrassed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The result was that the children learned never to question authority, always to obey,&quot; said Van der Hoven. &quot;He beat them frequently. According to the accused this sometimes amounted to assault. The father was unusually aggressive. He sometimes beat them with a cane until it broke. If they cried, he would hit them again. The result is that the children learnt to suppress their emotions and not to show their pain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were frequent rows in the family. When Eugene and his brother were six and five, their mother climbed into her car and threatened to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is how De Kock described the incident in his hand-written story: &quot;My brother and I, younger than I, were in the study and looked at the scene playing itself out in the window. He began to cry and was extremely anxious and I, although I did not cry, discovered a fear that we would both be alone.  It was an unfamiliar fear and no other fear - not during battles, not during hand-to-hand combat, or any other situation - was so intense in my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The accused describes himself as an average student,&quot; said the criminologist. &quot;Because of a speech defect, he was reserved and his full potential, for example as a strong leader, was not realised at school.  Because of the speech defect, he was mocked by the other children. He later went for speech therapy ... which helped solve the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This and the insecurity that derived from his family, along with his patriarchal, right-wing upbringing, all contributed to De Kock's decision to defend the political order of the day with an almost passionate commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of Van der Hoven's evidence described how the colonel suffered stress during his combat experience with the Koevoet counter- insurgency unit in Namibia. He drank heavily and, from 1983 onwards, regularly visited doctors to complain of nightmares, sleeplessness, stomach pains, dry mouth, an ache in the chest and &quot;lips that felt dead&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the bush war, and after he visited the scene of the Church Street bomb in Pretoria while on leave from the operational area, De Kock developed a fanatical hatred for guerrillas from the African National Congress and the South West African People's Organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quoting from the autobiography, Van der Hoven says: &quot;He resolved to fight the ANC in every possible way so that 'these kinds of monsters, the kind we saw destroy the Belgian Congo, should not be allowed to take over again'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When he was on his way to carry out an operation he prepared himself psychologically for it. He could not just kill people, but needed to have a reason for doing it. He started off from the point that people in possession of AK-47s were not coming over the border to look for work, but to come and kill. So they had to be eliminated. He learned to kill cold- bloodedly and with great efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The accused describes the intelligence world as a 'paranoid netherworld in which you are used, misused and abused. It is a world in which you have no friends. You were guilty only if you did not defend the public.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the week, Justice Willem van der Merwe asked the colonel if he used the time spent in his prison cell to reflect on those turbulent years because he regretted what happened or simply because he was no longer caught up in the turmoil of that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock replied: &quot;There were so many days when a person begins to wonder how it was possible that you could ever find yourself in such a situation. A feeling of remorse? Yes ... It is a cross I will bear for the rest of my life.  And if it was in my power, or any other person's power, then I would will that all those people who are not here today were alive ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Often when you rode away from the scene of a battle in Ovamboland in your Casspir, you would see the bodies of the enemy. It was strange. They alway looked as if they were smaller. They were not the same people you fought half an hour ago ... And a man began to wonder if you met these people in another context whether they would have been your friends. I cannot tell you, I do not have the vocabulary or the language skills, to give you a description of the feelings of loss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the end of the month, the judge will have to consider whether such poignancy is heartfelt remorse or a clever ploy to obtain a reduced sentence.  If it is the former, then there is hope for the generation that fought in South Africa's Vietnam.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Political parties are anticipating a review of the Constitution next year, leading to future amendments to the text, finalised by the Constitutional Committee this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the National Party and the Democratic Party say they will take the opportunity of a review next year to change the clause which prohibits parliamentarians from crossing the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently the Constitution does not allow party-hopping - a restriction seen by many as restricting independent political action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All amendments would be handled by a review committee which is described in the Constitution, although the text does not specify how often it should meet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indications are that the text will have to be amended in any case to make possible the implementation of a number of decisions which were made in a theoretical vacuum. The Local Government chapter, in particular, will need changing as local government structures are developed by government to meet the changing needs of South African communities. &quot;The idea is not that the committee should dribble out changes but that it should come with packages of amendments,&quot; said Colin Eglin, the DP's chief negotiator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inkatha says it is also counting on a review of the Constitution, despite having boycotted the constitutional process until the 11th hour, and having recently failed to have its way on a range of issues, including boosting provincial powers. Inkatha continued to hold bilaterals with the ANC on Thursday, in a last-minute bid to entrench traditional leaders in rural local government, despite the fact that negotiations were all but wrapped up on Monday, pending adoption by the Constitutional Committee on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFP negotiator Walter Felgate said he was setting his sights on later constitutional changes: &quot;That is the normal course of democracy ... There would be a process of incrementally changing the Constitution,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent legal experts and a number of those associated with the constitutional process say they are alarmed at the ease with which politicians anticipate changing the Constitution. &quot;We have made a constitutional pact ... this cannot be regarded as any normal piece of legislation,&quot; said an expert close to the process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africa has joined the body of nations agitating for a complete ban on the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti- personnel landmines - but campaigners say South Africa should prove its bona fides by legislating a complete ban locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackie Selebi, South Africa's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, last week joined representatives from about 50 nations in Ottawa, Canada, &quot; strategising towards&quot; a global ban on anti-personnel landmines (APLs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's participation in the conference, hosted by the Canadian government, signals that it has shed earlier pretensions to the &quot;middle ground&quot;, which was to support research into &quot;smart&quot; APLs as an alternative which was claimed to pose a lesser danger to civilians. Smart mines are designed to self-destruct after a set period of time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa disappointed anti-landmine campaigners last year at a UN Convention on Conventional Weapons conference last year, and at a review of that this April, when it supported the smart mine option - reportedly after the &quot;hawks&quot; carried the day in a split Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But pressure from non-governmental organisations, among others, soon set South Africa on a new course. In May a ban was announced on the export of South African APLs, and a suspension on their operational use by the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), pending a review of their military utility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Affairs liaison officer Pieter Swanepoel confirmed the policy change: &quot;The South African policy on landmines has over time evolved from first identifying so- called long-lived APLs as being the most problematic - and in this regard deciding they should be replaced by so-called smart or self-destructing APLs - to what it is now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;what it is now&quot; - the support of efforts towards a global ban on all types of APLs, said Swanepoel - still falls short of what the anti-landmine lobby wants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Noel Stott of the South African Campaign to Ban Landmines: &quot;If they are moving away from the smart mines position, we would welcome that, and if they are moving to ban the production of landmines, we would welcome that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he pointed out that no official ban on the production of APLs was yet in place, and that the suspension on the SANDF's operational use of APLs was still reversible pending the military utility review, to be presented to Cabinet as early as November. &quot;We would see it as a contradiction that they support a total ban eventually, yet fail to legislate it in South Africa yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selebi said that was probably coming. He said South Africa had a stockpile of about 300 000 APLs. Pending the military review on APL utility - which he believed would find against them - legislation could be passed early next year that would also ban production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stockpiles would also be destroyed then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selebi said the Ottawa conference had resolved on a number of initiatives to build support at international, regional and national level for a global ban, starting with a resolution to the UN General Assembly in a number of weeks which would, if adopted, encourage member states to implement their own moratoria on the use and transfer of APLs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An international study on the utility of APLs, conducted by serving and retired senior military commanders on behalf of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), concluded earlier this year: &quot;The limited military utility of AP-mines is far outweighed by the appalling humanitarian consequences... On this basis their prohibition and elimination should be pursued as a matter of urgency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study was endorsed by South Africa's Colonel AJ Rossouw, a former commander in mine warfare and clearance operations in Angola and Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC estimates there are as many as 110- million landmines spread in 64 countries worldwide, with another two to five million laid annually. They kill or maim between 1 000 and 2 000 people a month, mostly civilians. Africa bears the brunt, with countries like Angola (nine million) and Mozambique (two million) topping the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angola has the highest number of civilian amputees in the world. Most of them lost limbs in landmine explosions during the long civil war.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Protests are already being planned against a proposed World Bank loan to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Minister Trevor Manuel will face tough questions when he returns on Saturday from the joint International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank annual meeting in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs from his own party want information about a loan South Africa - in an apparent policy turnaround - is negotiating with the World Bank, while organisations are mobilising for a campaign around the visit next week by its managing director Michel Camdessus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bodies strongly opposed to the IMF and the World Bank, its sister organisation, have been invited to a meeting in Johannebsurg on Tuesday &quot;to discuss possible joint activities in relation to the Camdessus visit&quot; to raise awareness in South Africa of the role of the IMF and to stimulate debate around its policies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include trade unions, church groups, organisations involved in labour and economic issues as well as the South African National Civics Organisation and South African Students Congress. There is a suggestion that Camdessus be challenged to a public debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the organisers, Brian Ashley of the Alternative Information and Development Centre, said questioning of IMF and World Bank policies, which saw developing countries' economies opened by Structural Adjustment Programmes for the benefit of &quot;elites and monopoly interests&quot; in developed countries, had &quot;quickly turned to protest and then mobilisation as the full horror and social costs of these policies became apparent&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manuel said ahead of the Bank's annual meeting in Washington that talks around &quot;a small loan of less than $100-million had begun&quot; but added that they would not be a priority for South Africa at the meeting. Some commentators found his caution understandable given antagonism towards the bank among trade unions, NGOs and within the ANC itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scant details of the loan have emerged. Reportedly around $70-million, it is intended to swell a fund geared to help industry, particularly small to medium enterprises, become more competitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If signed, the loan will be the first concluded between South Africa and the bank since 1965. Bank staff have been involved in making policy on a broad front since the 1990 unbanning of the liberation movements, but agreed to ANC requests not to fund the outgoing apartheid government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until now the policy has been not to borrow from the IMF and the World Bank,&quot; said ANC MP Professor Ben Turok. &quot;I would imagine that quite a few MPs would have anxieties (about the loan). We have been told on a number of occasions that borrowing usually implies conditionalities and impacts on a country's sovereignty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue was &quot;very sensitive&quot;. Both the Bank and the IMF had been keen to lend to South Africa for some years, especially since the ANC came into government. &quot;The World Bank gives a great deal of technical advice on a broad front and two bank advisers were part of a panel that advised government on its macro-economic strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the question of South Africa borrowing money from the bank was a different matter, Turok said. Apart from conditions attached to loans and their impact on a country's sovereignty there was the question of interest rates. If South Africa borrowed at a particular rate and the rand fell further it risked falling into the kind of debt trap that had crippled Latin American economies, Turok said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are indications that the loan may be made in rands - an unprecedented step for the bank - and Turok said he had been assured by trade and industry director general Dr Zav Rustomjee the loan had &quot;no strings attached&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must await to hear from the relevant ministers whether this loan will lead to further borrowing or not,&quot; he said. &quot;We did not receive prior notice of this loan. People have only heard about it through the press. We have had no documentation - possibly because Parliament has been in recess. No doubt we will be given details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this time we must move as a body. The ANC, government and MPs must develop positions that are sustainable and agreed. I have sufficient confidence in the ANC and MPs to believe we will sustain a good position,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Every morning, the mother of a seven-year-old girl watched her daughter leave their Khayelitsha shack to walk to school. Most mornings, the child left home with an empty stomach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past few months the child hadn't reached school. Instead, she had been going to a house nearby where she was sexually exploited. In return, she was given a plate of food.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The child was first enticed into the house by a female resident who spoke convincingly about school being a waste of time. Eventually the child did not need convincing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After lunch each day, the woman took her to the bedroom and sexually stimulated her in preparation for her male partner to rape her. The child did not scream anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the school the child was supposed to attend, the children weren't much safer from abuse. Four nine-year-old boys recently took a seven-year-old girl to a secluded area in the grounds and attempted to rape her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While she kicked and screamed, they removed her underwear and their own.  One boy attempted to penetrate her anus and another her vagina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, a teacher heard the screams and intervened to stop the gang rape. When the children were asked why they tried to rape the girl, they said everyone else was doing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This child and others in &quot;desperate&quot; need of help will tell their stories at a special truth commission in Parliament on November 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children will testify to a panel of invited guests including Minister of Justice Dullah Omar, Minister of Welfare Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, Minister of Safety and Security Sydney Mufamadi, the attorney general of the Cape, the chief magistrate of Cape Town and the head of the Child Protection Unit, Anneke Pienaar. President Nelson Mandela has been invited to open the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will hear how the government has promised to help abused children, but has done nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the other stories collected for the children's &quot;truth commission&quot; is one of an eight-year-old boy who was sent by a social worker for counselling.  His mother has physically abused him on several occasions. The most recent incident happened 18 months ago when he asked for food and she slashed him with a panga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August the boy had an operation on the arm fracture caused by the panga attack. His mother had never taken him for medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their only source of income is a government maintenance grant. His mother had been sexually abused by her father and friends. She regards her son as a male who may do the same to her one day. Unless she receives counselling, her son's prospects are dim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All these children need help urgently, desperately. Where do we get help?  There is nothing available and the welfare budget has been cut again,&quot; said Bernadette van Vuuren, project co-ordinator of the non-governmental organisation (NGO) Resources Aimed at the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (Rapcan).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are no longer able to look to the government for intervention on behalf of the children. We resent being put in a position where we have to face children in such circumstances while we have been disempowered to help them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We educate adults about child abuse, about protecting children. We create an awareness of the law. And then we have to say to them that all the services they are entitled to, that are guaranteed by the Constitution, don't exist!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Vuuren said NGOs dealing with children had met with government officials at a number of forums where many promises, public statements and commitments to children had been made. She believed these were just &quot;empty promises&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And so on November 2, International Children's Day, the children will have an opportunity to speak. Let's see if the ministers we invite have the courage to listen,&quot; said Van Vuuren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rapcan, in conjunction with several other NGOs working in the field of children's rights, organised the &quot;Children's Truth Commission&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By this week, only Omar and Pienaar had confirmed that they will attend.  They will be joined by the head of United Nations Children's Fund in South Africa, Ian Mcloud, and a representative of the Save the Children Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimonies of the victims of sexual abuse will be delivered by social workers assisting them to recover from their ordeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to give the children an opportunity to testify directly to Parliament about the everyday crisis thousands of children experience in our country,&quot; said Van Vuuren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be an opportunity for children to ask questions and get some answers from the ministers and bring the attention and voices of perhaps the most important members of civil society to Parliament.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NGOs will document the event and present a report to Mandela and the United Nations. It will highlight clauses in the Constitution which impact negatively on children and sections of the UN's convention on the rights of children which are being violated in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa is a country envied by the world for its Constitution based on human rights, it is a country which has ratified the UN convention. On paper, the picture is wonderful,&quot; said Van Vuuren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, on the ground, it is a very different and tragic situation.  Studied closely, we are a country that is violating the rights of our children. At the moment, there is little or no child protection of any form.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Many black students believe Professor Johan van Zyl should not lead Pretoria university - because he is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whites, according to some black students at the University of Pretoria, should not get the top job at tertiary institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racism underpinned the student protest against the appointment of Professor Johan van Zyl as vice-chancellor this week at the university.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the South African Student Congress (Sasco) and Pan Africanist Student Organisation (Paso) this week accused Van Zyl of racism, saying he sympathised with the right wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White people should not head a tertiary institution in this country any more because they don't have a history in the education struggle,&quot; said Paso president Ignatius Molapo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Molapo said he was disappointed by the University's limited consultation with students on who would be appointed as vice- chancellor. &quot;He (Van Zyl) was not one of the people who attempted to bring about radical transformation at the university,&quot; said Molapo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Zyl countered this, saying one of his goals as vice-chancellor would be to bring about complete transformation, especially among students and staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people have accused me of being racist and others have called me a communist traitor - which probably makes me a middle of the road person,&quot; Van Zyl said. &quot;There has been such a tremendous transformation at this institution that people don't recognise Tukkies from the way it used to be five years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he agreed the transformation process could be better: &quot;As far as the staff is concerned we haven't even touched the surface.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasco has called for Van Zyl's resignation, saying he was imposed upon students and they were not happy with the procedure to appoint him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Van Zyl doesn't resign, the battle lines will be drawn. We will make his life and work at the campus very difficult,&quot; said Prince Mbethe, executive member of Sasco branch at Tukkies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the University Council was not nurturing the transformation process.  and there was no reason for negotiation as the relationship between Sasco and Van Zyl is &quot;not one of co-operation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasco said Van Zyl is popular only among right wingers at the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SRC president Abrie Bothma told the Mail &amp; Guardian: &quot;I believe they feel that transformation at the university has been too slow, especially because the last four executive appointments have been white males.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bothma said he was quite happy with Van Zyl and that he had a proven track record as dean of the faculty of agriculture. &quot;He incorporated a transformation programme at the faculty that increased the number of black students.&quot; Bothma added there was no evidence linking Van Zyl to the right wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week about 30 members of Sasco, Paso and Azasco (Azanian Student Congress) were arrested after an illegal gathering when the university obtained a court interdict prohibiting protest meetings on campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students were released after an agreement between them and the police about when they would appear in court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ill-fated South African Everest expedition has come under fire again - this time from an American mountaineering journalist who claims that expedition team leader Ian Woodall refused to allow stricken climbers use of his radio in the midst of a catastrophe near the Everest summit on May 10 and 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegation is made in a lead report in the September edition of American magazine Outdoor, by contributing editor Jon Krakauer. South African expedition photographer, Briton Bruce Herrod (37), died on May 24 after arriving on the summit at 5pm, about seven hours after Woodall, Rhodes master's graduate Cathy O'Dowd and three Sherpa guides summited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since his return Woodall has faced criticism from climbers and the media for failing to order Herrod down when they met him on their way back to Camp Four.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African climbing community is also still debating the decision of O'Dowd and Deshun Deysel to continue with Woodall after three strong South African climbers and the team doctor pulled out in protest at Woodall's &quot; disempowering and dictatorial&quot; leadership style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krakauer, who was a member of Everest veteran Rob Hall's disastrous commercial expedition, tells how he staggered down from the summit into Camp Four on the South Col in the middle of a hurricane that hit 30 climbers on summit day, May 10, and would kill eight of them, including two expedition leaders, within hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next morning the full extent of the disaster struck: he discovered the tracks of expedition mate Andy Harris leading over the western edge of the mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He writes: &quot;I returned to my tent just in time to overhear a radio call between Base Camp and Hall - who, I learned to my horror, was up on the summit ridge and calling for help ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then our radio batteries died, cutting us off from the rest of the mountain. Alarmed that they had lost contact with us, climbers at Camp Two called the South African team, which had arrived on the South Col the previous day. When Ian Woodall was asked if he would loan his radio to us, he refused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hall had been trapped on the summit with the last of his clients and was trying to short-rope him down. He is believed to have died that evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In further critical references to the SA team, Krakauer writes that &quot;a brilliant climber named Andy de Klerk&quot; and two other &quot;very strong&quot; climbers left after discovering that Woodall was &quot;a control freak&quot;, &quot;had lied about his climbing record ... allegedly lied about expedition finances and even lied about who was named on the official climbing permit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krakauer writes: &quot;By this point none of the four climbers left on the team had more than minimal alpine experience. At least two of them, claims De Klerk, 'didn't even know how to put their crampons on'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krakauer says that among the three weakest expeditions, the South Africans were an &quot;especially&quot; frequent topic of discussion around their dinner table in their mess tent at Base Camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hall had complained: &quot;With so many incompetent people on the mountain I think it is pretty unlikely that we will get through this without something bad happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hall, who was the most experienced Everest leader in the camp and was on the mountain for his eighth time, had called the meeting to prevent a dangerous gridlock of climbers on the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He writes that &quot;the council&quot; had struck up agreements on the order of days on which they would climb, with the exception of Woodall who &quot;declared that the South Africans would go to the top whenever they pleased, probably on the tenth, and anyone who didn't like it could 'bugger off'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hall, ordinarily extremely slow to rile, flew into a rage at Woodall's refusal to co-operate. 'I don't want to be anywhere near the upper mountain when those punters are up there,' he seethed.&quot; - Ecna</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l Ian Woodall has threatened to sue the East Cape News Agencies (Ecna) for a published report quoting East Cape rock climber Keith James for saying Woodall's expedition had been &quot;racist, sexist and undemocratic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woodall told Ecna that he and O'Dowd had stood by while bigger news agencies and newspapers had criticised the expedition, but that he would not let a &quot;jumped-up little agency like yours call me a racist in South Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Former prime minister PW Botha &quot;went through the roof&quot; when he heard the radical proposals of a hand-picked team of senior civil servants whom he had mandated to find solutions to break the deadlock with the ANC in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their final proposal, the civil servants who participated in Operation Skrik Vir Niks criticised the way government was handling reform and political resistance, snubbed the securocrats and the military, and predicted revolutionary conflict if steps were not urgently taken by government to change its attitude to the liberation forces and political change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their project document the team said the security forces did not have the resources to hold the liberation movements at bay for much longer and said the economy was suffering as a result of unrest and a lack of political vision.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They rejected the notion political reform could take place from within the apartheid framework, and pointed out the government lacked credibility and legitimacy among blacks and some groups of white people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government projects an image of insensitivity towards black people in particular, and is seen to misunderstand the legitimate aspirations of black people, as well as having only taken steps within a rigid racially defined framework in order to maintain the current domination of whites and keep the status quo,&quot; reads a loose translation of the document, which was drafted by a team of 40 top senior civil servants from non-security departments in March 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team - under the political leadership of Roelf Meyer - was requested to think creatively, not to be limited by government policy and to aim at providing real answers. The 40 civil servants, including former chief director of constitutional development Fanie Cloete and the then director of constitutional planning, &quot;Kobus&quot; Jordaan, met at the Union Buildings for three weeks in February 1987. Meyer was not present at the meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of that team have told the Mail &amp; Guardian they canvassed the opinions of liberation struggle leaders who were accessible in South Africa and then worked out a series of proposals which foreshadowed the announcements made by FW De Klerk in 1990, and later positions taken in constitutional negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project was listed as top secret and all documents were handed in after every meeting. The civil servants decided among themselves they would all sign the document at its conclusion for the sake of solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team proposed:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Initiation of negotiations for a constitutional order in which all South African communities would have a share in decision-making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Giving the vote to all South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Bringing the homelands and TBVC states back into South African territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Representation for all in constitutional structures on central, regional and local levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Decentralisation of power and privatisation of a number of government functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The legitimisation of the judiciary and the confirmation of the independence of the Bench.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Protection of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Scrapping of discriminatory laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Freezing of Parliament for a year and the setting up of an inclusive, transitional Parliament and executive authority to draw up a new constitution, allow temperatures to cool and for black people to have ownership of the process of transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The withdrawal of troops from the townships and the lifting of states of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordaan said this week:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think if these steps had been taken the transition between the National Party government and an ANC-led government would have been much easier and there would have been much less bitterness.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An operation code-named Skrik vir Niks was a lost opportunity which could have saved the country four years of bloodshed, political unrest and economic damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A secret document which throws new light on the origins of the reform process and undermines the reputations of key reformists in the National Party has been uncovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As National Party secretary general Roelf Meyer concluded the final round of constitutional negotiations with the African National Congress this week, and Dr Neil Barnard accepted the position of director general of the Western Cape, their past returned to haunt them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged that Roelf Meyer, then deputy minister of law and order, and Niel Barnard, then chief of the National Intelligence Service (NIS), stifled the proposals - known as the Skrik vir Niks project because it was so daring - to escape the wrath of P W Botha. According to an insider on the project, Barnard and Meyer engineered the sidelining of key civil servants involved in the project by taking away their security clearances, allowing Meyer to build his own political empire in the constitutional development department with Barnard eventually becoming his director general.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stifling Skrik vir Niks is estimated to have delayed South Africa's transition to democracy by up to five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer, who left the constitutional ministry this year after successfully negotiating the transition with the ANC, this week denied he had played any part in sidelining former constitutional development chief director Professor Fanie Cloete, and former director of constitutional planning, &quot;Kobus&quot; Jordaan, saying there was absolutely no connection between the withdrawal of their security clearances and operation Skrik vir Niks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two things were totally remote ... if this document was the reason, why were the rest of the team left untouched?&quot; he asked. He blamed Jordaan, now a Democratic Party MP, for keeping the story of his sidelining alive in the media over the last decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer said initially his memory of the radical document which was buried almost as soon as it was signed by the 40 senior civil servants, was vague but said he might have seen it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It should have met with our approval, certainly mine, but perhaps it was put aside because this document was probably ahead of its time and (when it) was developed, talks had already started secretly with Nelson Mandela through Kobie Coetzee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer later said he had confirmed this was so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This contrasts with a number of reports that Botha was outraged at the proposals and that those who drafted it knew they were waving red rags at the &quot;groot krokodil&quot; by sending it to Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the Skrik vir Niks team, Professor &quot;Jool&quot; van Tonder, said this week: &quot;There were long discussions over the document but in the end it was signed by every member of the committee ... because I am a team player and if they give one a hiding, they give all a hiding. It was a consensus document ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chris Heunis, constitutional minister at the time, warned us that PW would not like it, but he said he would not stop us sending it through ... We sent it through and spoke about it to one or two politicians such as Barend du Plessis who supported it and then we never heard anything about it again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Tonder said he had presumed it had been dropped because it was a time when &quot;PW was putting a stop to everything&quot;. A number of people involved in strategic thinking in the department at the time suspected that Cloete and Jordaan's key role in drafting the document led to them being pushed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has also emerged was that Cloete and Jordaan were pawns in a larger political fight between Heunis, constitutional development minister at the time, and a less liberal wing of the Cabinet led by then justice minister Kobie Coetzee and FW de Klerk, who had close ties with Meyer and Barnard, and who were both jostling behind the scenes to succeed PW Botha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heunis was excluded from the Mandela talks, and Meyer confirmed this week he may not have known about them, such was their secrecy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a snub for a constitutional minister who had the further indignity of losing two of his best men because they were deemed a threat to the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Heunis nearly wept when he heard about Cloete and Jordaan,&quot; said a source,&quot; but the orders came from the president's office and nobody knew why it had happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heunis has refused to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another insider said this week: &quot;Fingers pointed in the direction of Roelf.  For him career advancement was crucial.&quot; However, nobody the Mail &amp; Guardian has spoken to has been able to confirm on the record the allegation that Meyer, with the help of Barnard, was behind the scuttling of the document which put the proposals on ice until 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fanie Cloete, now a professor at Stellenbosch University and a key adviser on the transformation of the current public service, said: &quot;I had no knowledge of Roelf taking the initiative. The information at my disposal at the time indicated that the initiative was probably taken by PW Botha directly via the National Intelligence Service and the security police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloete said it had been a harrowing time in his life as he and his wife had been under surveillance. He said he still did not know what he could possibly have done to have led to such radical action being taken against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source close to Meyer said Heunis had the right ideas but was a difficult personality and it would have been disastrous for the government to have had him leading constitutional negotiations with the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the battle raged on in Cabinet and in the corridors of power, and when Heunis did resign in 1989, apparently in disgust with his colleagues, he paved the way for FW de Klerk to take over from PW Botha and to spearhead the negotiations himself, with Meyer, as his frontman and Heunis' successor, to provide the discreet face of reconciliation and NP compromise. A role that eventually earned him powerful enemies in the Afrikaner establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with Heunis's star on the wane and eventually out of the picture, a number of key jobs in constitutional development were given to NIS operatives Gustav von Bratt, Johan Spaarwater and Riaan Botha, with Barnard eventually becoming director general in 1992. Barnard was forced out of the department this year by the current constitutional minister, Valli Moosa, in a move seen by members of the department as &quot; liberating&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This department no longer has any secret functions,&quot; said Moosa. &quot;All its functions have been subjected to scrutiny and we are completely transparent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You must remember that we are all people of our time,&quot; said Meyer. &quot; Perhaps in the year 2000 people will look back and criticise our mistakes and, for example, suggest that we were too soft on the ANC in the constitutional negotiations ...&quot; Meyer said he sympathised with Heunis now, because just as Heunis's proposals had earned him the wrath of the party in the late 1980s, so Meyer's position and negotiating stance had made him unpopular among his colleagues during the 1990s.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it wasn't for the fact that we were sitting in the pleasant surroundings of the Nairobi Gymkhana Club &quot;Cards Room&quot; (cunningly converted into a press room) actually seeing the innings unfold, then we collectively would not have believed the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quickly the young man's bare essentials started to unfold. Only three (or four?) first class matches for a team called Karachi Whites in the Quaid-e- Azam Trophy back home in Pakistan. Tidy record but nothing outstanding. Like many Pakistani first class matches the totals were in the region of 700 and young Shahid hadn't got much of a look-in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most recent action was an under-19 &quot;Test&quot; series against the West Indies in which he had claimed a couple of 2-40s and 3-50s. Top score with the bat, at number nine, was 27. Only one journalist from Pakistan had made the trip from Karachi to Nairobi and he was now working overtime attempting to research the man/boy's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's bloody big for an under-19 player,&quot; suggested a dubious Ray Williams from Sapa. Just then another six landed in the car park at least 100m from where Afridi stood. His 50 came up from 18 balls. &quot;Bloody big.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journalist in question was Ilyas Beg from the Dawn Group of newspapers: &quot;He must be nearly 19,&quot; he conceded with a smile. But just to be sure, Ilyas strode confidently over to the Pakistani dressing room to check Afridi's age with the team's manager, Mushtaq Mohammed. Mushtaq knows a thing or two about being a young cricketer. He holds the world record, in fact, having taken to an international field at the age of 15 years and 124 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Ilyas returned it was with considerably less confidence. In fact his noble, Imran Khan-style complexion looked positively pale. &quot;Ahh, well, you see ... his passport says March 1 1980.&quot; Ilyas sat down to steady himself for the storm. Now we had something genuinely unbelievable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ilyas explained, hesitantly, that sometimes Pakistani parents don't register the birth of a child quite as promptly as they might. Sometimes, he said, it might even be a year before they find their way to the registrar's office. In Afridi's case, however, the parents' sense of direction was so poor it took them five years to find the way to the appropriate government building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are several reasons why this might be done, but the main one is obvious. In a country with so much poverty and with a still-burgeoning population, what better way to give your child a little head start than by allowing him to compete with his juniors? Just look at Waqar Younis. November 16 1971. Mmmm, 24 years old. He made his Test debut at 17, though. When he arrived at English county Surrey for his first season in 1990, the tabloids ridiculed his age and declared that he was probably bowling devastating in- swinging yorkers while still in the secure surrounds of his mother's amniotic fluid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that matter, Pakistan captain Wasim Akram turned 30 on June 3 this year.  Nothing strange about that until you encounter the man after a couple of days travel (from Toronto to Karachi to Nairobi in his case). His beard is almost completely grey. But then we musn't start getting paranoid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga what he thought about the whole thing. He is a funny man, Arjuna, but he didn't want to be drawn. &quot;I will tell you a true story, though,&quot; he volunteered. &quot;Many years ago I captained the Sri Lankan under-23 team in a tournament also involving India and Pakistan. The three captains met socially in the evening and discussed the tournament and a few other things. One evening the Pakistan captain introduced me to his wife and nine- year-old son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is another thing about Shahid Afridi that is genuinely unbelievable.  Gary Kirsten summed it up best. &quot;I promise you with all my heart, I am not exaggerating. His arm ball is Fanie de Villiers's pace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, of course, is impossible for a leg- spinner who bowls off four or five paces. Needless to say television replays confirmed that he chucked his quicker ball as surely as anything that Babe Ruth and Joe Dimaggio ever faced.  Pinch hitter Pat Symcox displayed the most rueful grin ever seen on a cricket field when his middle stump was uprooted first ball by Afridi. &quot;I didn't bloody see it!&quot; he chuckled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incidentally, news travelled slowly from Nairobi to Karachi so when an innocent phone call to Karachi Whites from an innocent member of the organising committee asking an innocent question about Afridi's age for the match programme, the man at the other end hadn't heard about his extraordinary innings. &quot;I can't remember his date of birth,&quot; he said &quot;but he's 21.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of this is probably masking the real truth, which is that Shahid Afridi might develop into an extraordinary talent. I have often wondered what journalists felt and wrote when they saw a 16-year-old Don Bradman, Vivian Richards, Imran Khan, Mike Procter, Barry Richards or Graeme Pollock.  Probably something similar to what we felt watching Shahid Afridi. After all, what's in an age?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - With the South African selectors choosing two touring teams, and with their eyes firmly on the 1999 World Cup, young players have the chance to prove themselves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andre Markgraaff, our national rugby coach - though this is perhaps too simplistic a title given his new exalted status - has made no secret of his approach to picking Springbok teams. &quot;I am by nature conservative about selections,&quot; he has said on more than one occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while some of his choices might belie that statement of intent, it is undoubtedly the pivot on which Markgraaff bases his thinking. With that as a given, the looming announcement of the South African squad to tour Argentina and France and then go on for a one-off Test against Wales will be interesting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also the equally important matter of pulling together the best of this country's emergent talent for the South African &quot;A&quot; side's tour of Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Put together, they present an almost unique opportunity for a selector in this country, the chance to expand a squad from the 36 due for top honours through picking a second string combination. Interestingly enough, a similar tour in Europe led to the call-up of Gavin Johnston to higher honours on the last tour to South America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markgraaff is unlikely to deviate much from the players used in the Sanzar series against Australia and New Zealand and the three-Test series against the All Blacks which followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of special note in this regard will be whether Markgraaff &amp; Co reinstate Francois Pienaar to his rightful position as captain, confirming that Gary Teichmann was a caretaker choice, or do what many would consider the unthinkable and stay with the incumbent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the muddled thinking that Markgraaff applied to making Pienaar - such a special forward and an inspirational leader - play himself back into the side through the barely concealed injury that finally sidelined him against the All Blacks, anything is possible and nothing should be taken for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard the renaissance of James Small may have been brought about by no less a rugby personality than Louis Luyt, but has yet to be confirmed by Markgraaff. Small's public apology for &quot;crimes&quot; perceived to be beyond the schoolmasterly pale by the coach signalled the start of the fiery winger's re- acceptance. The rubber stamp has yet to be effectively applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, given the lightning which has only briefly flickered through South African backplay this season, Small must surely be an automatic choice as one of the world's premier wingmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also the fact, proved with conviction in the Test against Australia in Bloemfontein, that Small is a more than adequate fullback at international level and an able substitute for Andre Joubert. And, make no mistake, this position must be an area of some concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joubert, great player that he is, has made the No 15 jersey his own, and it will be interesting to see whether Transvaal's Gavin Lawless or Russell Bennett of Border get the back-up berth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the wings - given that Small travels - there is also the interesting prospect of young Breyton Paulse making the trip. Should this be the case, the man most likely to lose out would be Pieter Hendriks, whose form of late and ill-discipline must surely count against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacques Olivier has returned from injury - and to fine form - and Justin Swart has done nothing wrong. But then neither has the Natal flier Cabous van der Westhuizen who has had a marvellous season and more than deserves a look- in despite being past his 33rd birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But given that Markgraaff has also consistently said that he is building towards the next World Cup campaign in Wales, now just three years away, Paulse would be an obvious choice, while Van der Westhuizen's claims would seem to diminish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been nothing quite as exciting as this 20-year-old from the Western Cape for years, and giving Paulse the feel of a big tour is a real investment in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same is true of the young Northern Transvaal centre pairing of Danie van Schalkwyk and Andre Snyman who must surely make the trip alongside automatic choices Japie Mulder and Hennie le Roux, who will probably be chosen at flyhalf to understudy Henry Honiball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of whether Jeremy Thomson makes it remains a poser only Markgraaff can answer, but certainly the peroxide Durban blond deserves a shot this time out as one of the most penetrative and thinking players in the middle of the park thrown up this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joost van der Westhuizen is a certainty at scrumhalf but now that Johan Roux has pulled out due to injury, there is room for other candidates behind a pack combination that should show few changes from the Markgraaff pattern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schutte Bekker to back Teichmann at eighthman; Fritz van Heerden, Wayne Fyvie and Andre Venter to underpin Pienaar and Ruben Kruger; and Hannes Strydom, Krynauw Otto and Steve Atherton coming in behind the first choice lock pairing of Mark Andrews and Kobus Wiese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a number of points worth mentioning in the composition of the second rowers. The injury which has ruled out Johan Ackermann for the season must be weighed against 1999 and his return to fitness. Atherton is more than adequate at the side of the scrum and, if Markgraaff truly thinks about it, he will start grooming Andrews now for a return to the eighthman slot Kitch Christie slotted him into in the last World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrews showed some limitations in the position during the final stage of the world championship, but having him at the back during the next World Cup in Wales adds a staggering extra dimension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hooking duties will surely be split among James Dalton and Naka Drotsky, with Henry Tromp coming in as well. Os du Randt aside, there remain some problems with our props that have to be sorted out before 1999, but it is well to remember that Ollie le Roux, injured right now, must remain part of the equation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one thing is certain, all of the players who do make the major tour will, like their coach, be looking over their shoulders at the &quot;A&quot; side. For these are the comers. These are the real challengers for places in the national squad, and it will be well for all concerned to remember this.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - India believe South Africa have a weakness when facing spin, and have loaded their bowling attack accordingly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is of more than passing interest that India, the country which took the first step towards rebuilding this country's cricketing strength by becoming South Africa's debut opponents in the new, democratic era, should have focused on our single biggest weakness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Hansie Cronje's side about to embark on a tour of the sub-continent which represents the first half of a six-Test home-and-away series this summer, Sachin Tendulkar's team have loaded their five-day side with spin for the one-off Test against Australia, currently under way in New Delhi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subtlety of spin has been a weapon against which South Africa has shown consistent vulnerability, something which the Indians have been quick to home in on. Against the Australians, India have sacrificed the batting skills of Sanjay Manjrekar, Ajay Jadeja and Vinod Kambli to harness a spin attack consisting of Amil Kumble, Sunil Joshi, Narendra Hirwani and Ashish Kapoor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this, the Indians show a historical adherence to what has traditionally been their strength at home. The Indian cricketing psyche is finely attuned to the nuances of the slow, turning ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the South Africans, brought up more on the cutlass of seam, the rapier of spin has tended to provide more than just a nagging headache and, while coach Bob Woolmer has been quick to stomp all over suggestions that this is an exploitable weakness, this smacks more of a morale-boosting whistle against the wind than facing the reality of the task ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It takes no more than a brief glance at the South African top order to see that the chink in the armour of what is an extremely professional and rounded team does indeed exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Hudson has never been truly comfortable against bowling where the ball refuses to come onto the bat. Against spin, his flowing strokes sometimes become a stuttering series of short-arm jabs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Kirsten, installed as Cronje's vice- captain in the injury-driven absence of Craig Matthews, is a direct contrast to Hudson in this regard.  Gritty and determined and without Hudson's elegance at the crease, Kirsten is less troubled by the turning ball, seemingly playing each delivery on its own merits. This, perhaps more than anything else, has made him the world-class player he undoubtedly is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cronje himself is often vulnerable to spin and has the added disadvantage of being in the process of batting himself back into form. Daryll Cullinan's superb stroke-making abilities have shown cracks against class spin bowling in the past, as his record against Australia's Shane Warne attests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cullinan also carries an injury - a chip in the bone of his little finger - into the tour and, while this has been dismissed as minor, it must be remembered that outside of technique and concentration, a batsman's hands are his only real working tools. Jonty Rhodes too has a limited arsenal against the slower stuff, seemingly stuck in the groove of trying to sweep anything at less than medium pace. This inclination will surely not have escaped the Indians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is, admittedly, a thumbnail evaluation, and, given the fighting nature of the side which has been South Africa's biggest and most valuable attribute since re-admittance to the world stage, one which will hopefully be proved wrong. But it does, nevertheless, not inspire a great deal of confidence on paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does sound a strident trumpet note for the side though is the inclusion of Lance Klusener, Nicky Boje and Hershelle Gibbs in the touring party, alongside Derek Crookes, as the thin edge of the wedge of the new brigade of players starting to break through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stress fracture suffered by Jacques Kallis and the groin strain which has sidelined Paul Adams have opened a door for the younger players, and, while the all- round abilities of Kallis and the mesmeric anti-style of Adams will be missed, it is to be celebrated that this country has the depth to pull in players of the talents of Gibbs, Klusener, Boje and Crookes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Crookes, who shares the spin bowling with veteran Pat Symcox and young Boje on tour, will prosper in India remains to be seen. But exposure to the guiles and flighting so much a part of the Indian game in this department can only help improve the way Crookes delivers his offspin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India are never an easy side to beat in their own backyard. The off-field conditions, the tortuous travel, added to the fiercely partisan crowds and tricky fields, all combine to take their toll on a touring party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is the sure knowledge that Cronje's side, despite any real or perceived weaknesses in the overall make-up, are not going to give up without a fight. Lying down on the job is simply not a thing that any team from this country has even begun to contemplate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this is a series - quite apart from the triangular one-dayers against the hosts and Aussies - which promises to deliver much. We await this delivery with some anxiety but great anticipation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Touring squad: Hansie Cronje, Gary Kirsten, Andrew Hudson, Daryll Cullinan, Hershelle Gibbs, Jonty Rhodes, Brian McMillan, Derek Crookes, Dave Richardson, Nicky Boje, Pat Symcox, Lance Klusener, Allan Donald and Fanie de Villiers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It seems that a good place to find South African literature these days is on the radio. Especially for those who aren't able to read the latest and best locally produced works, SAfm's various programmes featuring South African fiction must be a boon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presently being read in over the air in the 10pmslot, Mondays to Thursdays, is Zakes Mda's novel, She Plays with the Darkness, read by Peter Se Puma. It will be followed, from the end of the month, by Uncertain Consolations by novelist and M&amp;Gcritic Jane Rosenthal, which will be read by Gaby Lombard.  After that, in mid-November, Gillian Garlic will take on Jenny Hobbs's The Sweet-Smelling Jasmine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes,&quot; says SAfm drama head Julia-Ann Malone, &quot;we are making a concerted effort to promote South African literature. There is so much quality local literature that it's easy to find good books.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the late-night reading slot, there are various other times at which South African writers find a radio audience. The daily serial at 7.15pm, Monday to Friday, presents dramatised novels such as David Lambkin's The Hanging Tree (running until October 18)and Andre Brink's Imaginings of Sand (coming soon).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday nights at 9pm, the play slot features work by South African playwrights of the ilk of Neil McCarthy, Anthony Akerman and Sue Pam-Grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is The Poet Speaks on Sundays at 6.30pm, and the classic South African novel read at 8pm on a Sunday -- all in all, a considerable literary spread for listeners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE MATCH by Ben Temkin (New Millenium, R65)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Temkin is the author of several non-fiction works, mainly in the field of finance. This is his first venture into comic fiction, but his sense of humour can be glimpsed in the witty title for his study of two stock exchange swindlers - &quot;Fiddlers on the Reef&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In The Match he puts his knowledge of South Africa and its history to good use in a satire whose prologue sets the fictional town of Trekseinde in an authentic-sounding historical context. The events that follow as the inhabitants of this little dorp attempt - or fail to attempt - to come to terms with the new South Africa are highly amusing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main issue, as the title implies, and the source of consternation to the verkrampte whites of Trekseinde, is the integration of school sport decreed by the government. Complete with vicious editorials from the local newspapers, biased reporting on the pirate radio station (named, ironically, Radio Liberty) and a new terrorist movement with a scatological acronym, The Match reflects and deflates many recent incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the book will appeal to anyone unfamiliar with this country's past and present tribulations is a moot point. However, as a South African I found the thinly-veiled political parody great fun, and its ultimate intimations of reconciliation and hope encouraging.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Ancient lore, modern art. Once upon a time, Qauqaua, a beautiful San woman, murdered her husband in revenge for his murder of her mother. Clytemnestra, who in Greek legend killed her husband Agamemnon in revenge for his killing of their daughter, would have identified with Qauqaua.  The two women are probably in some sort of netherworld together or, as Carl Jung would have it, our collective unconscious.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Qauqaua died, the story goes, her blood seeped into the earth, part of it forming an alien, huge rock in what is now northeastern Namibia, near the Botswana border, the rest forming a root, a sought-after veld food. So every time you eat that root, you eat of her blood, so to speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now her legend has been written down in parallel texts of English and Naro, a San dialect of the Gantel area in Botswana, following the version given by Coek'e Qgan. It is apparently the first time a book has ever been published in a San language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the project goes further than that - it includes contemporary San art and has been created as a finely crafted, beautiful object, says publicist Tamar Mason. There are 11 hand-printed colour lithographs and seven linocuts created by nine different artists at the Kuru Art Project. Published by The Artist's Press of Johannesburg, in a limited edition costing R3 420, Qauqaua is bound in goatskin tanned in the San village of D'Kar, where the artists live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The San women Cg'ose Ntcox'o, about 40, Dada Coex'ae, about 80, and Xguka Krisjan, 34, were on hand in Johannesburg recently to help launch the book, helped by Hunter Sixpence, 28, the son of a San woman and a Zambian veterinarian assistant apppointed by the group as a publicist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The book shows how Bushmen lived long ago,&quot; said Dada through Sixpence's translation. &quot;It helps preserve our customs and culture and teach young children how we lived then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contemporary painting and craft originated at the Kuru Development Trust. In 1989 it organised a group tour to the famous Tsodile Hills site in northern west Botswana to view rock paintings there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This resulted in the birth of the art project, which kicked off with women painting on fabric. The directors have been careful to avoid giving art lessons, instead providing facilities, materials and encouragement - and then just letting creative juices flow, says a press release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today the artists prefer painting with oil on canvas, and there are about 10 men and women involved. They have held exhibitions in Southern Africa, Europe, Australia and America and have been invited to design murals and a mosaic for the state hospital in Gaberone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why publish such a fancy book? Why not print a coffee table book and sell it through the bookshops?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very hard to make the initial breakthrough in publishing,&quot; says Mason. Now, however, they can take their publication to a commercial publisher to release it in a more widely available version.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Besides,&quot; says Mason of the limited edtion, &quot;we wanted to do something beautiful and special.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - If reading President Nelson Mandela's autobiography Long Walk to Freedom is still on your &quot;things to do&quot; list, chances are the century will draw to a close before his bestselling tome gets taken off the shelf.  But take heart. A short-cut to hours and hours of dedicated reading is now on offer, giving insight into the mind and soul of the president and enabling contributions to coffee-table conversations around one's &quot;favourite Nelson Mandela anecdote&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long Walk to Freedom, as abridged by editors Coco Cachalia and Marc Suttner, will soon be in the bookstores, published by Little, Brown and Nolwazi, educational wing of Macmillan's South African operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one-sixth the length of the original, and at R19,95 less than half the price of the soft-cover edition, and written in plain English, the paperback is accessible and easy-to-read. And, while it has been whittled to the quick, say Cachalia and Suttner, it still &quot;retains some of the juicy stuff&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts in the field of adult literacy, they approached Mandela with their idea of condensing the story of his life into a version accessible to the millions of marginally literate South Africans who are, after all, among his most ardent supporters. &quot;He was very receptive once we put the idea to him, and immediately saw the importance of producing an abridged version of his book that was easy to read and affordable,&quot; says Cachalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After lengthy negotiations with Little, Brown (who published the original) and Nolwazi-Macmilllan, the two sat down to extract the essentials of the biography and rewrite sections into simpler English. The process took four months. The final product was then handed to Ahmed Kathrada for checking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although we rewrote in parts, we kept to the original as much as possible.  We had to stay true to the spirit and content of the primary version and follow the whole thread of his life - his personal and political development,&quot; says Suttner. &quot;We were driven by the fact that the majority of people in this country who historically constitute the president's followers couldn't benefit from the original.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the result is a worthwhile read for anyone who wants to get some historical facts straight and a sense of Mandela's remarkable life in a single sitting. Some episodes gain a greater impact in this shorter setting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An example is the anecdote about how, during the Rivonia trial, Govan Mbeki tricked a particularly nasty Lieutenant Swanepoel by secretively writing a note and circulating it among the trialists. &quot;Swanepoel dashed over and grabbed the piece of paper out of his hand ... a few moments later he rushed in and shouted, &quot;I will get you for this!' Govan had written in capital letters: 'ISN'T SWANEPOEL A FINE-LOOKING CHAP?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Cachalia and Suttner, the work &quot;tells the story of South Africa from a very special man's point of view and stands alone as a book in its own right&quot;.  In putting together this abridged version of Mandela's life story, they hope to elevate accessible- language writing into a genre of its own, provide the impetus for more such works and stimulate the creation of new supplementary reading matter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Eminent film director Idrissa Ouedraogo, born in Burkina Faso and based in Paris, is currently in the sixth week of shooting his first English-language film in Zimbabwe's Domboshawa, a rustic area outside Harare.  Domboshawa has duly been dubbed &quot;Dombowood&quot;, location for several of the recent batch of Zimbabwean features. It provides huge boulder-like hills and plenty of open space, and it's only an hour's drive from the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His film is titled Through The Day. Noe Productions (which also produced the director's stunning short film about Aids, Afrique Mon Afrique starring Ismael Lo), the UK's Polar Four, Ouedraogo's own Les Films De la Plaine and Framework International, a particularly prolific Zimbabwean production company involved in much of the resurgence of feature film production in the country, are all co-producers in the project - with additional financing garnered from Polygram, British Screen and the European Community through a funding treaty involving Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso and Ethiopia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lead producer Cedamir Kolar of Noe Productions, who counts among his credits the visionary Macedonian film Before the Rain and Emir Kusturica's brilliant but compromised US debut, Arizona Dreaming, talks about Through the Day's genesis. &quot;Idrissa always wanted to make a big film about French colonisation in Burkina ... a period epic. But with all the hassles and huge expense of such an idea, he decided he wanted to make something more modest.  Small in size and populist. I like the idea that you can take a movie to some community and project it on a bed-sheet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kolar explains that Through the Day is a minimalist story. &quot;It's a melodramatic tale of friendship; there are no spectacular moments apart from character.&quot; In it, South African actors Vusi Kunene and David Mohloki play two friends who discover a battered old car and restore it with the idea of travelling to the city. They eventually start a business together, but everything goes sour when greed and jealousy get the better of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Ouedraogo is probably best known for his painterly rural epics such as the exquisite Tilai (The Law), a tale of honour and incest in a small village which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. His films are all notable for their intense attention to picaresque detail.  Frankie Loader, wardrobe designer on Through the Day, agrees: &quot;He has images in his mind that are quite specific and generally relate to a West African kind of styling. In this film we had to define the difference between the urban and rural environments through the wardrobe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the intense heat, there's an easy- going, playful atmosphere on set.  As I arrive they are shooting a scene in the clapped-out, rusty Rover 100.  Ouedraogo sits under a big beach umbrella watching the scene on a video monitor. He seems to be doing the assistant director's work as he shouts, &quot; Silence! Moteur! Go Kini!&quot; in an indelible French accent and with a cigarette hanging from his mouth. Vusi Kunene climbs out of the car, delivers his first line and then stops, distracted. A donkey in the background has farted.  Everyone breaks out in laughter, but after a few minutes Ouedraogo shouts &quot; Vous etes pret? (Are you ready?)&quot;. The technicians are ready and they go for another take, cinematographer Jean-Paul Merisse (who photographed Lars Von Trier's visually stunning Europa and his latest award-winning picture Breaking the Waves) capturing the scene on Super 35mm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the crew are enamoured of the director. &quot;His English improves day by day. He's very endearing; quite an inspiration actually. The other day an actor was performing like a snail, so when Idrissa gave him direction he mimicked the actor speaking very slowly,&quot; Loader relates with an affectionate smile. Special assistant on the project Edwin Angless is equally charmed: &quot; What's amazing about him is he goes again and again, and if the scene's not working he thinks on his feet and comes up with an immediate solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A veteran of African cinema (he worked on Souleyman Cisse's Yeleen, among others), Angless relates an anecdote about the shoot. &quot;There was this day when Idrissa designed an incredibly complicated semi-circular track to cover a scene. But the dialogue ran out before the shot did. John Kani came up with a solution - a joke that fitted perfectly. And with no hesitation Idrissa went with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidently he has a great way of dealing with tension on the set, telling jokes about things like eunuchs from Mali to defuse the situation. Although based in France, it seems that Ouedraogo hasn't been totally accepted by the Gallic person in the street, and remains a film festival figure as opposed to a popular cineaste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man is remarkably energetic. He sleeps little. The night before the shoot he was partying until dawn and already up-and-pumping on set at 6am.  When I asked him where he gets all the energy from, he was surprised. &quot;It's simple. I like life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One-time ZPRA officer and victim of a CCB car bomb in 1987, co-producer Jeremy Brickhill of Zimbabwe's Framework is especially proud of the project. &quot; This is exactly the kind of film we want to be involved in - a mixture of Zimbabwean and South African cast and crew and a Burkinabe director ... It reflects our commitment to a Pan African cinema.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I ask Ouedraogo about this kind of lofty ideal he responds in a refreshingly candid way, &quot;Pan African ideas mean nothing to me. That's a political idea. The point is that cinema is 100 years old, but in Africa it's 25 years young. Each country is still trying to find its feet, so by working together we can develop a stronger identity for African cinema.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Africa's most esteemed director now working in English and down south, it seems that African cinema is moving away from the ghettos of French colonial and cultural paternalism and developing its own new persona.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Everything from gospel to kwaito features on Sipho Hotstix Mabuse's first new album in five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You hear the name Hotstix and you think Burnout and Jive Soweto even though the songs are 12 years old. Then you say that it's a pity, but Hotstix really hasn't done anything to equal those songs since. For Sipho Hotstix Mabuse this is a problem.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burnout has been something of a millstone around his neck, he says. &quot;But you can't stop counting the sales. It still sells to this day. I got a call from someone in Holland who'd just bought my new album, as he put it. And it turned out to be Burnout. It sold over 500 000 on EP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a song that crossed the colour divide, appealing to black and white equally and this, he says, is the objective with his new album, Township Child. &quot;Our musicians need to awaken to the reality of our socio- political situation and start focusing on the wide musical tastes of the market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The album features good, appealing dance tracks among the dizzily eclectic mix of maskanda, folk-ballad, reggae, jazz, gospel, jive and kwaito. Why such marked diversity? &quot;It shows how confused I was!&quot; he ripostes, and adds, &quot;I felt the need for people to hear how much music there is in this country. I didn't want to stick to one sound ... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, he says: &quot;On this album I've tried to move away from Burnout so that people will now think 'Wow! There's more to him than just that'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's Hotstix's first album in five years and it was recorded over a year with a range of musicians, including sax player Khaya Mahlangu, bassist Victor Masondo, trumpeter Stompie Manana and maskanda musician Umfaz'omnyama - which means &quot;black woman&quot; - who is actually a man. &quot;What a performer!&quot; enthuses Mabuse, but he can't explain the odd choice of name. &quot;You'll have to ask him. He's a great act, it's like watching Jimi Hendrix.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maskanda comes from the Afrikaans musikant, explains Mabuse, and its polyrhythmic guitar style is specifically Zulu and Baca, not Xhosa at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also introduces a beautifully haunting Basotho instrument, the lesiba, in the track Thaba Bosiu. Close in sound to a Jew's harp, consisting of a wooden stick, gut and a feather, it's used by herders in the mountains to call their sheep &quot;and each flock knows the distinctive sound of their own herder's lesiba. You have to belong to a particular lineage to play it,&quot; he says, emphasising the need to preserve &quot;almost extinct&quot; instruments and music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born the child of a Zulu mother and Tswana father, Hotstix moved from Soweto to Memel, near Newcastle, when his parents split up. He was 10 years old. &quot;It was straight from an urban setting to a rural one. I used to look after cattle, herd sheep. The move was traumatic, I can tell you.&quot; His grandmother looked after him while his mother worked in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't like it at all ... But this is how I got to interact with maskanda. A musician named uShenkele used to come to the village all the time to sing these songs.&quot; At the same time, he took kwela sounds to the country, forming a little boys' band and going to the church every Friday to perform.  He also found a piano in the priest's house - &quot;it minimised the trauma&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowadays his favourite music is jazz (the strains of Billie Holiday's Don't Explain at the interview venue were a complete distraction), and says South African jazz should be seen in its proper context. &quot;I'm not sure people play jazz here much, it tends to get confused with marabi and township.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The album includes the by now obligatory track in tribute to Nelson Mandela, but before you start snarling about hagiographies and national sentimentalism, it's the best I've heard. Mandela himself put in some session time to re-record a section of the speech he made at the Rivonia Trial.  Whether or not he was paid session fees, is not entirely clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mabuse's personal favourite is a surprise. Called Enchanted Garden, it's a new-age ballad in praise of his flowers. &quot;I just love gardening,&quot; he says. &quot;My fans probably won't understand the way I feel about it. But it's a part of me and I must express it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wrote and produced all the tracks himself, as well as playing drums, alto sax, flute, piano, percussion and bass. It would, he says, be &quot;easy to play bubblegum music, but could I really call myself a serious musician, especially after so many years in the industry? I do not want to pigeon-hole myself. I want to be a total musician in the mould of Phil Collins, Sting or Al Jarreau.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few of the paler and younger folks realise the extent of Mabuse's history and fame in music. Turning 45 this year, he joined a high school band at Orlando West in 1967 at the age of 15. It was called The Beaters, and included Alec Om Khaoli, Selby Ntuli, Arthur Rafapha and Monty Saitana Ndimande. &quot;We didn't have any intention of it becoming a professional band,&quot; he says, but that's exactly what happened.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - So many stories to be told. So few ways of really telling them. This is the conclusion some viewers will draw after seeing Roger Meintjies's visual essay on the Suez/Aida Project and Chinchona Project.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now don't get me wrong. Meintjies, a South African artist now living abroad, is an extremely intelligent practitioner. He is also one of an intrepid few prepared to meander beyond the discipline of photography as documentary truth- teller into the realm of story-telling, and from the empirical aspects of the medium into a more complex conceptual arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the exhibition press release points out, Meintjies's approach is &quot;to blur the boundaries between art exhibit and anthropological museum, in an effort to create work that is accessible to countries such as South Africa.&quot; He has chosen as his thematic fulcrums the chinchona tree and the Suez/Aida Project - two subjects about which little is known in South Africa. To those unfamiliar with the chinchona, this is the tree that produces quinine, the drug that assisted the European penetration of Africa in the 19th century, thanks to its medicinal properties that protected the colonisers from certain diseases endemic to the &quot;dark&quot; continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using photographic images from archives, libraries and private collections, Meintjies has traced the movement of chinchona from the Andes, where it originated, through its evolution as commodity, currency and consumable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Suez/Aida Project has a 8x5m banner hung outside the front window of the Rembrandt Gallery, filled with columns of apparently unconnected names, places, rivers, animals and plants. This aspect of the exhibition works most effectively. Not because it depicts Europe's imperial aspirations in planning the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, and its connection with the world premiere of the opera Aida. Rather, its resonance lies in its minimalism and the associations the viewer is forced to make or dismiss between language and its referents - whether real or imagined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Meintjies seems to suggest, such is the stuff of which history is made.  And the viewer cannot simply gaze at the material object - as one might a landscape - for comprehension and edification. Access demands active engagement with the work and an attempt to read both on and between the lines.  The paradox is that even though the emphasis in this work is not on finished product but on process, the former cannot possibly encapsulate the latter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The less successful component of Meintjies's show is the chinchona essay.  While it works as a general pictorial overview of the chinchona tree genus, it offers little insight into the imperatives behind its commodification and consumption. Meintjies has provided only cursory information on labels accompanying the images. His attempt to address the complexities of documentary photography without the crutch of textual accompaniment is courageous. But ultimately the essay reads a bit like a oarless sailboat in uncharted seas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet the stories, whether they are about the poppy flower, the marula tree or the baobab, are waiting to be told. And this one, despite its inevitable shortcomings, certainly deserves to be read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinchona Project and the Suez/Aida Project are on at the Museum Africa and the Rembrandt Gallery respectively</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one of the most beguiling characteristics of conceptualism: its identification of art not as object but information. This information is presented not as a given, fixed reality, but rather as an accumulated, reconstructed process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ground-breaking local television series, Ghetto Diaries, won the award for best documentary at the 1996 Southern Africa Film Festival, held recently in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brainchild of filmmaker Teboho Mahlatsi and M&amp;G Television Productions, the series provided a refreshingly gritty visual diary of township life and the aspirations of its residents.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes Ghetto Diaries unique is the fact that the stories were told by &quot; film-makers&quot; who had never held a video camera before. Inspired in part by Channel Four's Video Diaries and screened on SABC1 in March this year (Ghetto Diaries II is due to be screened on SABC1 in February 1997), the series represents a radical departure from the traditions of conventional documentary television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After putting the trainees through an intensive three-week training course Mahlatsi commissioned an ex-gangster, an unmarried mother, a student, her unemployed father, a policeman, an ex- prisoner, a taxi driver and a matric pupil to record their own lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In last week's Mail &amp; Guardian review it was incorrectly reported that Marc Radomsky won the best documentary director award for his Ghetto Flowers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Connie Masilo-Matsunyane is one of South Africa's hottest soap opera stars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She seems thrown by a voice on the other side of the cellular phone requesting, nay demanding with desperation, an interview the following day.  But she recovers quite quickly, explaining that she can only meet a day or two after that. Connie Masilo- Matsunyane, one of South Africa's rising queens of the small screen, one of the cheerful continuity faces in between programmes on SABC1, and bad girl Karabo Moroka in the soap opera Generations on the same channel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few days later, at the SABC canteen, she orders a vitamin-filled fruit juice, almost in silent admonition of my strong, dark coffee. She launches into the tale of a long journey from Kimberley where she was born in 1970...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she was five years old her parents moved to Botswana and her greatest concern at the time was trying to speak Setswana as spoken by the Batswana people: &quot;Having grown up speaking Afrikaans I found it very difficult to adapt to this new language.&quot; Her father, originally hailing from Botswana, had decided to return home and take his family with him. What he had not counted on was his family's unwillingness to accept his coloured bride from South Africa - particularly considering that a bride had already been chosen for him by the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He moved away again and ended up in Lobatse, where he and his family spend most of their time. It was there, in a local karate dojo, that he would train with the gawky, tomboyish Connie who was so thin that he thought she had tuberculosis. &quot;I don't know how many check-ups I had,&quot; she recalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it was there that Masilo senior first entered his daughter in a beauty pageant. She sees my raised eyebrow and explains that although her father was in many ways a very strict, there was also another side to him. &quot;We had so many rules like not going out during the week, but he was very open. He also probably thought that by entering me in this pageant I would be less shy than I was at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This bit of creative child-rearing seems to have worked wonders, for the young Connie went on to win the furniture shop-sponsored pageant. The minor triumph had her sent to Johannesburg to compete in the regional - Southern African - leg of the contest. Part of the winning prize - which, of course, included furniture - was a braiding course at a hairdressing school in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving away from her family in semi-rural Lobatse to live with a relative in Soweto was traumatic: &quot;After a week I wanted to go back home, &quot; she says of the experience. She stayed in Emdeni township, considered by some to be a particularly violent part of the already violent cluster of townships.  Traveling to and from the centre of town was not a walk in the park either: &quot; People would talk and I could not understand a word of what they were saying.&quot; Growing up in unilingual Botswana was not much of a qualification to deal with the multiplicity of cultures in Soweto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was, however, not the end of the world for a very young Connie who, through her new-found contacts in the growing television industry, had happened to hear of auditions being held for a local television drama. She won the lead role - something which still seems to surprise her ten years later. &quot;All I thought I would be doing in South Africa was to do my braiding course and then go back home and here I was getting a lead in a major television production.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the beginning of her extraordinary success in the television drama industry. A success that has seen her included in seemingly every second drama churned out by the extremely prolific - and distinctly uncreative - African language drama department of the SABC. A success that has her appearing in two disparate dramatic roles at the same time: as an upwardly mobile doctor with a social conscience in the series Soul City and as a truly bad girl in Generations. &quot;With the doctor in Soul City, that character is like Connie and therefore not difficult to play.&quot; The real rider was playing Karabo Moroka - a spoilt brat who ends up in the clutches of a destructive drug habit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't smoke or drink and I don't have any friends I know to be taking drugs ... I really had to search deep inside myself to find that desperation.  The inability to leave the character in the studio was another obstacle.  Sometimes I would go home and find myself shivering as I would have been playing a scene where she was experiencing withdrawal symptoms.&quot; As if that wasn't enough, the character's violent mood swings proved just as difficult. &quot; I sometimes wonder what method actors go through,&quot; she says, half to herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She gathers her belongings as she tells that in addition to her continuity work, she is in the process of negotiating a radio job. &quot;Until the contract is signed, I cannot say which radio station though.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems the gawky girl from Lobatse has finally arrived in the big city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The trend of featuring children in advertisements has provoked outrage in some circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one knows for certain who coined the phrase &quot;butthead&quot;, but most South Africans will recall it as the endearing expletive in the Sanlam Bank &quot;For Sure&quot; advertisement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The words mouthed by a toddler togged up as a company boss were targeted at a Dennis-the-Menace lookalike wearing a sweaty vest, boots and construction helmet. The words certainly propelled an otherwise unremarkable figure of speech (&quot;For Sure&quot;) into the realms of the unforgettable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adorable, right. Or deplorable?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no denying it: children spell C for cash. Children in commercials bring money to supermarket chains and products catering to the ever- burgeoning consumer market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for the growing number of marketing executives fighting the increasingly cut- throat battle for commercial dominance, children are becoming nothing less than highly effective weapons aimed straight at the potential consumers' purse-strings .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the increasingly popular trend of featuring children in commercials that advertise products primarily for an adult market is fraught with controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain, for example, two tousled toddlers starring in a TV campaign for dominance of the nation's trolley trade, offer more than a study in childhood innocence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a British market research, six out of 10 consumers would recognise one of the toddlers as Harry, the Safeway trolley kid. Not yet five years old, he already boasts a fan club of thousands of lovestruck mums and children clamouring for mementos of the little star who totes the British equivalent of our Pick 'n Pay. Harry has become such a hit that his ads have contributed to Safeway's increased profits for 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But since the introduction of Molly as the under-five leading lady, who responds to his come-on with a curt put down, the cheeky chat-up ad with adult voice-overs (and innuendo) has caused an outcry - not over increased profits mind, but the potential for pervertedness on the part of paedophiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So serious is the public's concern that the matter has been raised in British Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the response merely a symptom of the neurotic Nineties or are children featured in commercials becoming the latest victims in a long list of commercial exploitation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Psychologist Susan Hope-Bernard, who has worked with paedophiles for over 10 years, certainly veers towards the latter view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hope-Bernard fears that the apparently harmless and endearing scenes portrayed in child adverts serve to reinforce the grossly distorted beliefs harboured by paedophiles regarding the behaviour of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paedophiles interpret normal gestures by children as deliberate acts of provocation; they believe that children are sexually aware and this cognitive distortion is used to justify their behaviour. This kind of advert is certainly not helpful and could be dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Adam Leigh, account director at Bates Dorland, the agency who made the &quot; When Harry Met Molly Ad&quot;, rejects the deplorable argument. He estimates that as many as 30- million people have seen the ad, but only 20 have complained. &quot; I believe these criticism reflect more on our accusers than on ourselves&quot;, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All our scripts are regulated by the Independent Television Commission.  The children love doing them and we see them as being a lighthearted, popular method of getting a variety of messages across to consumers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, South Africa's Advertising Standards Authority stipulates that no advertisements should, among other things, encourage children to enter strange places or converse with strangers in an effort to collect coupons, wrappers and labels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, no commercial featuring children should suggest in any way that unless children themselves buy or encourage other people to buy services or products they will be failing in some duty or lacking in loyalty towards a person or organisation. But nothing is written on featuring children in adult scenarios with sexual innuendos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says a senior accounts director at a local leading ad agency: &quot;We would never use children to simulate adult mating games, but for children, acting in commercials is the fulfillment of a fantasy. Children love to dress up and pretend to be grown-ups. The fact that they are paid to do it actually reduces the potential for exploitation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But psychologist Anne Hill likens children in advertising to an elevated form of child labour. &quot;Children are extremely impressionable and the most seemingly innocuous form of role-playing may affect them in ways that are not evident to people in the advertising industry. Kids in advertising also tend to become much more image- and status-conscious than their non- exposed peers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a time when they should be focussing on innocent pursuits, their competitive instincts are being developed, and at a time when money should be the last of their worries, they have become marketable commodities and income earners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we therefore looking at a generation of kids earning corporate salaries from commercials before they've learnt to cope with pimples and mixed parties? Or is there really no harm in cultivating a culture of corporate ad- kids?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the adorable/deplorable debate signifies another example of storm in a nappy trivia is questionable. It certainly is true that as in pornography there is no proven cause in the relationship between advertising imagery and aberrant sexual/violent behaviour. But one should never underestimate the power of the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what this &quot;kids in the commercials&quot; controversy highlights is the issue of the exploitation of children, their status and rights in life, art and business.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Government communications will go through a massive overhaul and fundamental restructuring if the recommendations of the task group on government communications (Comtask) are accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comtask, which outlined the findings of its eight-month investigation at a conference in Caledon in the Western Cape last weekend, was scathing in its description of current government communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight-person committee found that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* too few resources are applied to communications;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the government does not give the matter sufficient priority;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* there is a lack of central co-ordination of the government's message, no co- ordination of messages between government departments and not even co- ordination of messages on one issue within a department; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the subject is not taken seriously at a high-enough level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Communications remain a Cinderella and the government is substantially impoverished by its own inability to take this crucial aspect of governance seriously,&quot; they concluded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The severe criticism of government media operations ran almost from top to bottom. The sole exception was the president's office, which &quot;runs an efficient communications system&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;the Cabinet does not&quot;, and ministries are &quot;structurally disempowered&quot; because they have only one media liaison officer, and often these are plucked from departmental structures &quot;regardless of their communication skills or their sympathy with, and understanding of, the policies and persuasion of the minister&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similiar criticisms were directed at departments and provinces. The committee cited lack of creativity, shortages of resources and the absence of a clear policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Affairs Department was singled out for special mention: information flow to overseas missions was inadequate, there was no guidance on priorities, no overall strategy and co-ordination, with the result that the country was putting out a confused set of messages abroad just as the country's &quot;honeymoon&quot; period was ending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of its more biting remarks, Comtask said: &quot;The term 'new South Africa' is not a sufficient marketing strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the strongest words were aimed at the institution which is supposed to deal with all these issues - the South African Communications Services (Sacs).  Lacking a &quot;clear mandate&quot;, Sacs appeared as &quot;a collection of undirected components&quot;, all suffering from low morale and with &quot;no clear basis on which to restructure or reform itself&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So low was its level of interaction with government departments -which should be the core of its work - that two-thirds of ministeries, departments and provinces only had contact with them &quot;from time-to-time&quot; and 17% &quot;not often&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comtask reported a &quot;lack of enthusiasm for Sacs across the government and in the media&quot; and &quot;low credibility&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no evidence that the man brought in by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to transform Sacs, Sol Kotane, had done anything to change the situation. In fact, he showed his contempt for the work of Comtask by packing up his bags halfway through the conference - having said nothing in the debate until then - and leaving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently he had to attend a conference in Harare, but made no apology nor offered an explanation to the meeting and left behind no one to argue his case. He boasts a staff complement of 500, but apparently none of them were able to participate in the rest of the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comtask went on to recommend a complete restructuring of the system, including the closure of Sacs, allowing ministries command over their department's communications, giving the matter a higher financial and policy priority and outsourcing most media production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only centralised bodies in their new structure would be an office in the presidency to co-ordinate overall messages and avoid duplication, and a small body of experts to bulk-buy media space for the government in order to effect savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also a host of secondary suggestions: that old South African censorship laws still on the statute book be cleaned up; that Channel Africa receive funding to continue broadcasting across the continent; that a system be set in place for the long-term funding of the South African Broadcasting Corporation; and that the Open Democracy Act be passed into law to fulfill the mandate of open and accountable government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the conference drew to a close, it was clear that Comtask had come a long way since it was set up by the deputy president last year. A major focus at that conference was the status of white-dominated media and the level of criticism aimed at the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comtask, under the chairmanship of author Mandla Langa, expressed concerns about these issues, but chose to refer them to the Competitions Board. It kept its focus on the gross inadequacies of government communication, and resisted the temptation to divert attention to the media itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many at the conference were left asking whether these recommendations - so different from the media critique frequently offered by Mbeki - would be implemented. Certainly, the signs were not all good: when Kotane abandoned the meeting, it was left to Mbeki's representative, Thami Ntenteni, to take up the fight to keep Sacs in place and try to re-direct criticism towards the media and away from the government. And Deputy Minister Essop Pahad appealed to the meeting &quot;to be kind to Sacs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Congress of South African Trade Unions representative also rushed to the defence of Sacs with a raw denunciation of what she said amounted to a &quot; privatisation&quot; and the loss of jobs. The irony of trade unions, a South African Communist Party chief (Pahad) and a former African National Congress propaganda artist (Ntenteni), supporting an arch-apartheid creation was not lost on the audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comtask will now wrap up its report by the end of the month, and send it on to the deputy president. Will he, delegates were left to ponder, accept recommendations he does not particularly want to hear?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - According to Norway's Trygvie Nordbye, chairman of the International Council for Voluntary Agencies (ICVA), 300-million people are hurt by war, earthquake or famine each year. The 1996 world budget for emergency relief and rehabilitation is $8 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western companies dominate the market for supplying goods and services to help the devastated. The United States leads with 18%, followed by Italy, 12%; Croatia and the UK, 5% each; France and Germany, 4%. The strong presence at World-Aid 96 of the Benelux countries and Scandinavia (both 4%) shows that they are out to increase their share of the aid business.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India led the way among the Third World exhibitors: there were Tata vehicles from Bombay, Rajan agricultural machines from Madras, Ajanta medicines made in Bombay, Mauritius and Uzbekistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World-Aid has a strong Bosnian influence, a distinct military flavour. This lies strangely with the humanitarian non- governmental organisations (NGOs) - ActionAid, Oxfam, Save the Children, Acord, Care and World Vision. They usually try to avoid soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military influence is really hi-tech. Never mind the sophisticated telecom equipment: just the camping gear was amazing. Canadian tents like winter palaces. Finnish sleeping bags thick enough for the Himalayas, which double as stretchers. And the clothing - World-Aid offered fire-proof jackets and helmets and shrapnel-proof knickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Bosnian influence, AES of Weybridge unveiled its new &quot;NGO Flatbed&quot; truck made in Turkey by British Motor Corporation. Such things blow the mind of a simple African development worker. For just 49 000 you can have a 6m container for goods or transform it into a mobile clinic or workshop. It can be adapted for fuel or drinking water, or a load of 60 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most spectacular example of military partnership is the Bofors de- mining vehicle. Bofors is a well-known Swedish manufacturer of guns. The company offered to help Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) develop a vehicle to explode land-mines, based on the adaptation of a German Leopard II tank. The prototype weighs 55 tons, and will start work at the end of October in Bosnia.  Its rotary front is composed of a mass of metal lumps that should detonate every mine in its path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NPA has contracted to buy a second type of vehicle from Aardvark of Scotland, which is adapting forestry technology to create a machine that will thrash the ground with mine-detonating chains. This will be tested in Angola in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beside the land-mine exhibit, a hospital tent was equipped for amputating children's feet. The operating theatre is fuelled by solar panels. The Norwegians have a remarkable partnership between the Trade Council, commercial suppliers and NGOs, supported by the government. They have put together a unique system through which commercial companies hold stocks of approved disaster equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NGOs approve the equipment specifications, the companies guarantee delivery within 24 hours of a disaster, and the government provides most of the money. So successful is the system that it has become a substantial export earner. In 1995, 50% of its emergency supplies were sold to non- Norwegian sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one end of the hospital tent I found a solar fridge made by NAPS. &quot;This is the Camel Fridge,&quot; said Torill Furuland. &quot;You put the fridge on one side of the camel, the battery pack on the other side, and the three solar panels sit across the top. This is how they vaccinated all the refugee children in Somalia: with 35 fridges sitting on 35 camels. There is space for the vaccines for 2 000 children in this fridge, with four shots for each child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I looked at the other solar devices for disaster relief: computers, radio telephones and fax machines can all be run in the middle of the Sahara desert these days. &quot;Governments will not put money into this solar business,&quot; said Furuland. &quot;If they did, we would all be using solar energy in our houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problems are in the storage of energy and the efficiency of solar panels. Lots of university engineers have prototype solutions, but it takes a lot of money to turn a boffin's theory into a commercial reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I need solar energy now; I cannot wait for the cheaper version. In my house in Mali, I already have 12-volt solar lighting, and an efficient solar water heater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the NAPS catalogue I saw a beautiful solar 60-litre fridge that I want to buy for my bush-house. And then, in the hospital tent, I found a beautiful cooker that concentrates the heat of the sun on to the cooking pot. I bought it on the spot. It will save me burning gas, wood and charcoal. I have asked Torill Furuland to quote for 20 more to be delivered to Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Sainsbury and the Co-op signalled the start of a new era in British high-street retailing last week when they launched a project to transform their trading relationships with Third World producers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two grocery groups have teamed up with the Fairtrade Foundation to develop codes of conduct that should result in improved conditions for workers making their own-label products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-month pilot project includes purchases of flowers from Kenya, tea from India and electrical goods from China. Sainsbury aims to get commitments to a code of practice from all its developing country suppliers by March 1998.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wendy Wrigley, head of brand and corporate marketing for the CWS, said the interest in fair trade stemmed from the Co-op's &quot;responsible retailing&quot; initiative two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a consumer-owned organisation, our agenda is driven by consumer concerns, not by the City,&quot; she said. &quot;This is about a basic set of standards which customers can expect from us as a retailer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sainsbury's Petrina Fridd said the chain's interest also came from shoppers' concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supermarkets will develop codes based on a Third World suppliers' charter launched last week by the Fairtrade Foundation, which is backed by charities such as Oxfam and Christian Aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charter incorporates minimum standards laid down by the International Labour Organisation, covering areas such as child labour and working conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pilot projects will also work out methods of monitoring conditions on the ground. Phil Wells, the foundation director, urged UK buyers to take responsibility for improving conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Charter:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Responsibility for suppliers' working conditions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Commitment to decent conditions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Widely accepted standards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Monitoring by or on behalf of the UK buyer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Involvement of workers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A continuing trading relationship</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Conditions to be a key factor in selecting suppliers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Sub-contractors to be included</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Standards to develop with changing conditions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Independent auditing</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Aventura, the state-owned travel and leisure company, is being primed for privatisation, the culmination of three years of transformation from a loss-maker to a streamlined commercial enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of State Enterprises is planning to complete a draft tender document by the end of this month and potential investors should have their bids in by the end of November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top of the list of potential bidders is the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), although a Dutch airline with an associated hotel chain has also expressed interest, as has a local mining house in association with black partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With tourism set to become the next big business in South Africa, the timing could not be better. The boom in the hospitality industry is being hampered by a lack of beds on offer to local and foreign tourists from the major hotel chains.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aventura also occupies a crucial niche in the travel industry because it offers affordable accommodation to local tourists - including the emerging black middle class with new amounts of leisure time and cash to spend on holidays - when the cost of staying in the leading hotels and game lodges is spiralling beyond the reach of most South African holiday-makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research shows that although most hotel and lodge chains target the lucrative foreign tourist market, more than 60% of the demand for leisure accommodation is generated from inside the country - and is likely to escalate as the leisure classes expand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the pressure on the Ministry of State Enterprises to come up with a standard tendering procedure for the &quot;restructuring&quot; of state companies, it is likely that Aventura, which is not a profit-making or strategic corporation, will provide the first model for privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aventura is likely to be followed by the sale of Sun Air, the South African Forestry Company (Safcol) and the state's diamond cutting industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Commercial Catering and Allied Workers Union (Saccawu), a Cosatu affiliate which organises at a number of Aventura resorts, has recently come out against the privatisation of the corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will add an interesting dynamic to the tender process as - regardless of whether this consortium is awarded the tender - it will indicate whether organised labour will drop its principled stance against privatisation in return for the opportunity to gain some control over state-owned enterprises by investing members' provident funds in them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of its restructuring programme, Aventura is discussing a share- ownership scheme with its staff of 1 500. On the table are proposals that 2% of the shares be allocated across the board according to a formula that emphasises length of service. Another 23% of shares will be held in reserve for staff to acquire through purchases or other finance schemes - leading to an eventual 25% ownership of the corporation by employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Created in 1993 out of the former government's Overvaal Resorts, Aventura adopted a new name and a new image. Under a new board of directors, led by Alan Louw, Aventura has been undergoing a steady transformation. State subsidies have been replaced by bank loans, although the debt burden is still heavy at R34-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cuts have been made to staffing levels, but privatisation will not mean further retrenchments, says an insider; indeed, the company is looking to expand its operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The turnaround has been dramatic: from an operating loss of R15-million in 1993 Aventura is now breaking even; turnover and revenue have risen substantially. And with occupation rates growing at 10%, it can look forward to greater increases. Its14 resorts, traditionally venues for middle- to lower- income white holiday-makers, but fast becoming popular among other racial groups moving into these income categories, generate a turnover of about R110-million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aventura provides hotel accommodation at its two main resorts, Warmbaths and Badplaas, but its operations are primarily aimed at self-catering and caravan and camping facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aventura has not relied on the buoyant tourism market alone to boost its income; facilities have been upgraded and refurbished, with new product ranges, such as the holiday clubs, akin to timeshare schemes, helping to attract clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In line with its bid to appeal primarily to South African tourists who want a &quot;quality holiday experience or breakaway experience at realistic cost&quot;, Aventura is promoting resorts that are either located near prime wildlife areas or at mineral springs. Its Warmbaths and Badplaas resorts are being billed as places where people can spend healthy leisure time with extensive recreation facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five other resorts - Eland, Swadini, Blyde Canyon, Loskop Dam and Plettenberg - are taking advantage of the current vogue for nature travel and are being aggressively marketed as eco-tourism destinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor has the community been forgotten: Aventura plans to involve rural communities in various aspects of its business by offering cultural groups from villages or townships near its resorts the opportunity to make money from their performances for tourists.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The government is finding that trying to get to grips with the booming consultancy industry is as difficult as wrestling with an octopus.  This emerged in the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee when it considered the special report by Auditor General Henri Kluever on consultancy services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee heard this week that although the regulations covering the hiring of consultants had been beefed up since Kluever released his report, the government was still receiving proposals to appoint consultants at anything between R5 000 and R15 000 day, &quot;which is not acceptable&quot;, Kluever said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To measure the extent of the problem, his department undertook a snap survey of government departments. State Expenditure Deputy Director General Tobie Verwey said it appeared that the government was employing 2 359 consultants at a cost of about R1- billion this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cautioned, however, that these figures were &quot;very soft&quot; as there appeared to be inconsistencies in figures supplied and replies had not been received from six of the nine provinces, nor from the office of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the consultants were professionals, such as lawyers and architects, who were employed at set rates. But 562, costing more than R230-million, were in the &quot;problem categories&quot; of advisers or information consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no professionally set fees for such consultants and they appeared to be asking for what they wanted, no matter what the real value of their services were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kluever said there were still no guidelines on acceptable pay levels for consultants and it appeared that no matter how much the regulations might be tightened, &quot;the biggest problem is that they are often ignored&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In view of the case of Eugene Nyathi earlier this year, who was paid R1 million for two months' work by the Mpumalanga province, Kluever was also concerned that the regulations did not, in terms of the Constitution, apply to the provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is really a serious problem and we can't walk away from it and just let the provinces do their own thing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Expenditure Director General Hannes Smit said, however, that he was liaising closely with the provinces on how to handle consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the major problem was that there was no agreement on the definition of a consultant, &quot;and we are running out of ideas on what a consultant is&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, his department had decided to stick to the definition that consultancies covered &quot;services contracted out and persons contracted in&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank, for its part, had said that &quot;advisory and support services are those services that are contractually obtained from non-governmental sources in support of government/departmental policy development, decision- making, management and administration, support and improvement of management systems, and in supervising the execution of government projects&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Congress MP Barbara Hogan said she sympathised with Smit's dilemma as the word consultancy was being &quot;used very freely these days&quot; and covered not only qualified professionals such as lawyers and engineers, but also human resource consultants, information technology experts and advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter were &quot;not necessarily vultures living off the state&quot; and played an important role in helping to improve the capacity of the new government to deliver services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem was that they were not &quot;organised&quot; under professional associations and charged a wide range of fees. The government would have to try to find a way of ensuring some consistency in the fees charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said that although tendering procedures had been &quot;sharpened up considerably this year&quot; to ensure some control, not all consultants were employed through the Tender Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was agreed that the answer did not only lie in tighter regulations, but in training to ensure that government officials could better manage their affairs, including the employment of consultants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The government's planned tax holiday scheme will be up and running by the end of the month, says the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The regulations outlining the Act will be finalised by the end of the month and published in the government gazette.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax holiday scheme will, in essence, provide for a zero tax rate, ranging from two to six years, for manufacturing industries that meet the criteria laid out in the regulations. The overarching objective is promoting international competitiveness.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three prominent related industrial development goals are targeted: priority industries, regional development and labour intensity. The scheme is limited to entities incorporated after October 1, whose sole business is the qualifying project, with assets exceeding R3-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax holiday will be heavily weighted in favour of labour-intensive firms. There is also a strong emphasis on regional and corridor development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the areas already identified are Vereeninging and Vanderbijlpark in Gauteng, Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal, and the Middleburg/ Witbank region in Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also a desire to tilt the system in favour of labour intensity above a predetermined benchmark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applications will be evaluated by the Regional Industrial Development Board, and for each incentive approved and certified, the qualifying company will enjoy tax- holiday status for two consecutive years, starting as soon as the company makes a taxable profit. New companies will also qualify for accelerated depreciation. The benefit must be claimed within 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief director of the regional industrial development programme, Johan Reinhardt, said the scheme must be seen within the broader context of the government's supply-side initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include an accelerated depreciation tax allowance, enabling existing manufacturers to expand in response to the challenge of globalisation. Both schemes are part of the Revenue Amendments Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have already seen considerable interest in the scheme from investors,&quot; says Reinhardt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus told Parliament last month that a key component of the strategy was to move from demand-side intervention to supply- side support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax holiday programme should be seen as a key element within a broad and coherent set of industrial development programmes aimed at growth, employment and redistribution, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben van Rensburg, director of economic affairs at the South African Chamber of Business, said the tax holiday was being viewed very positively by local business. He feels it should achieve its aims of providing for investment and job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only concern that he feels needs to be addressed is the potential for abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The administration could be open to abuse. If the government needs to, then a couple of years down the line it could retract the whole scheme, which would lead to another round of uncertainty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax holiday system has been discussed with the Katz Commission, which is not, in principle, opposed to its implementation. It did, however insist on two critical conditions: first, that the list of priority industries and regional corridors to qualify be clearly established at the outset and not changed during the course of the implementation of the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, that the tax holiday should not be open-ended, but have a pre- determined cut- off point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reinhardt didn't feel there should be any cause for concern that the scheme could affect the current tax base. The spin-off effects, created by new capacity, will be more positive than any concern about the loss of a tax base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not an opinion shared by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) . It feels the introduction of tax holidays incorrectly relies on tax incentives to channel private sector investment, at the same time undermining the state's tax base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It voiced concern that the tax holidays will result in a declining contribution to state revenue by business, shifting the tax burden on to the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu feels the assumption that concessionary taxation will lead to increased levels of private sector investment is misplaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This assumption has not been proved in practice, particularly as other factors are likely to predetermine investment decisions - such as shortages of skilled management or labour, the lack of infrastructure or increased costs of imported equipment owing to the currency depreciation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A fresh broadside has been fired against Amalgamated Banks of Southern Africa (Absa) in a new book by former Absa executive Bob Aldworth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Infernal Tower: The Damage to People, Careers and Reputations in Corporate South Africa is the first attempt at threading together one of South Africa's most sensational corporate sagas: the complicated sequence of events surrounding the formation of Africa's largest bank, Absa, and the Reserve Bank's controversial R1,5-billion donation or &quot;lifeboat&quot; to the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aldworth paints a picture of a Broederbond- dominated bank that spent millions obsessively pursuing - in the courts and with less orthodox methods such as extensive phone-tapping and energetic smear campaigns - four men employed by or associated with the bank, including himself. All have been charged with fraud, but none has yet been convicted. The book says two - Aldworth and Trustbank chief executive officer Hennie Diedericks - seriously considered suicide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man within Absa who steered what are presented as extraordinary vendettas was former Absa chief executive Piet Badenhorst, sacked after Absa's shareholders became fed up with the welter of negative publicity surrounding the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had pursued personal vendettas and engaged in activities in the name of the bank that were inappropriate and without regard for who was hurt. Without question he besmirched Absa's name in the market place. How could depositors believe that a banking group that invaded the privacy of individuals and bugged their telephones, would deal with their financial affairs with a duty of care? ... Piet was not only cutting down people, he was destroying the market,&quot; writes Aldworth with the help of two co-writers, Jeremy Gordin and Benjamin Trisk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aldworth's attack against Absa's top men does not stop with Badenhorst's departure. He quotes a startling remark from Badenhorst's successor Dave Brink, the leading businessman brought in to put Absa right: &quot;Bob ... even if you are tried and are found not guilty, I will always consider you guilty,&quot; he said of the fraud charges Aldworth has yet to face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aldworth describes how Brink assured him he would talk to Absa's board about the charges against him, but instead went to Absa's management committee and turned against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the grey shoes and the grey socks - watching, in their minds' eyes, their safe jobs, big cars and pensions disappearing - formed a solid grey wall and paraphrasing Macbeth, said: 'We have gone so far in blood; it makes as much sense to go forwards as backwards.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aldworth suggests Brink, like other board members, was &quot;kept in the dark and fed manure&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aldworth also points out that two senior Absa executives who have admitted to conspiring over Badenhorst's extensive phone-tapping - Danie Cronje and Alwyn Noeth - have stayed on at the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other main players who came up against Absa are British businessman Julian Askin and Kevin de Villiers, chief executive of Allied Bank, which was swallowed up to make Absa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Askin took over the Tollgate group in the run-up to the Reserve Bank's R1,5- billion gift. He claims Absa misled him about the state of the company, which it liquidated before obtaining access to the Reserve Bank's rescue money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Askin, who Aldworth reveals as having hired a team of former British agents to help build a case against Absa, was charged with theft after he returned to Britain. He was arrested while on holiday in Italy and spent three months in an Italian jail - an episode that was the subject of an official complaint from the British government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aldworth, throughout the book, alludes to Absa's efforts to sway the judicial system. In this instance he says: &quot;Who sent them? Who could possibly have persuaded the Italian police to behave like this?&quot; Aldworth points out there is no extradition treaty between Italy and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aldworth suggests Askin's experiences in Italy have discouraged him from returning to face Absa's charges in the South African judicial system.  Instead, he wants to clear his name in the British High Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Absa this week published a press statement in anticipation of the book's release that said both Aldworth and Askin faced charges of fraud and had in the past made &quot;serious and totally false allegations&quot;. It says Askin was described in the Cape Supreme Court as having engaged in &quot;thievery and roguery on a grand scale&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aldworth describes Justice Harold Berman's comments as &quot;prejudicial and irregular&quot;. He says that on one occasion the judge briefed a journalist in his chambers and on two occasions he confronted a member of Askin's legal team in a shopping centre with &quot;extraordinarily prejudicial information&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aldworth writes that Berman, who has since died, was reprimanded by the Judge President for his behaviour in the failed sequestration hearing against Askin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aldworth recounts how De Villiers infuriated Badenhorst by using a range of &quot;conventional and unconventional means to push up the price eventually paid for the Allied&quot;. Badenhorst described De Villiers as &quot;dead meat&quot;. De Villiers described Badenhorst as the &quot;Zsa Zsa Gabor of South African banking&quot; and an &quot; embittered Afrikaner with a CA&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aldworth wraps up the book by detailing the extraordinary events surrounding the suspension of a commission of inquiry into the Tollgate liquidation this year. Absa demanded the commissioner, Bertrand Hoberman, recuse himself for being partial after Diedericks had given his version of how Absa used the &quot;lifeboat in cushioning the impact of the Tollgate liquidation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He charts how Absa fortified its case for Hoberman's recusal by recording how in September 1994 Hoberman was found guilty by the Bar Council of breaching professional ethics. He was fined R1 000 for not disclosing to his attorney an agreement he had reached with opposing counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aldworth presents Diedericks as an impeccable banker. The former Broederbonder eventually settled Absa's R19-million fraud claim by paying them R375 000. He was asked by his Dominee to stop going to church and his son was singled out during a lecture at the University of Stellenbosch and told his father was a &quot;crook&quot;. He tells Aldworth that Volkskas was more than just a bank - it was &quot;a political vehicle through which money passed to support the system of the ruling class&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writes Aldworth in the book's prologue: &quot;The strange mixture of arrogance, cruelty, lack of fair play and incompetence that is demonstrated does in ce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rtain respects remind one of some of the excesses of the former regime. Not surprisingly, since Absa began its life run largely by men who saw themselves ... as bankers to the apartheid government.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARUSHA, Tanzania - Following is the text of Christopher's remarks as prepared for delivery by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on arrival in Arusha, where he met with the Presidents Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, and the former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, who is directing regional peace initiatives aimed at resolving the Burundi crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good afternoon. I have come to Arusha to meet with President Mkapa, President Moi, President Museveni, former President Nyerere, and foreign ministers from around the region. I want to thank President Mkapa for hosting today's meetings and our other colleagues for participating in them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most urgent issue on our agenda today is Burundi. The United States condemned the July coup in Burundi and we have supported regional leaders in their extraordinary efforts to resolve the conflict. Our goals are clear: to restore democracy, to protect minority rights and to prevent further bloodshed. These goals cannot be achieved by force of arms or imposed by one group of Burundians over another. The United States calls on both sides in the conflict to suspend their hostilities and to begin all-party negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, we cannot dictate the terms of a settlement; that is the responsibility of Burundi's people. Our responsibility is to press both sides to reach an agreement that allows all the people of Burundi to live together in a secure and democratic country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we see progress, we must be ready to recognize it. Both sides have expressed a willingness to negotiate. Mr. Buyoya's decision to reopen the National Assembly and to lift the ban on political parties is encouraging.  The rebel groups must know that we expect them to choose dialogue as well. It is time for all sides to stop the killing and to start talking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With good faith on all sides and the continued engagement of a united region, we believe a peaceful settlement is attainable. Should the situation in Burundi deteriorate further, however, the international community must be prepared to act quickly to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe. Yesterday at the OAU, I called for the creation of an African Crisis Response Force so that the continent will have the ability to respond rapidly and effectively to crises in Africa and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also spoke today about our efforts to encourage the voluntary repatriation of Rwandan refugees. The U.S. has provided $850 million in humanitarian aid to this region since 1993. We recognize the burden the countries of this region have faced and we appreciate their generosity. But we must now pursue a more comprehensive approach to the problem the camps pose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believe it is time to close the camps closest to the Rwandan border that pose the greatest security threat. The refugees should be encouraged to return voluntarily to Rwanda, which we believe most can now do safely. Where that is not possible, they should be moved to camps further from the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later today, I will meet with Louise Arbour, the Chief Prosecutor of the International War Crimes Tribunal. The Tribunal serves a critical purpose -- not just to punish genocide in Rwanda but to deter genocide in Burundi and elsewhere. The United States has been the strongest supporter of the Rwanda Tribunal. I am pleased to announce that we will contribute an additional $650, 000 for its work, which will be tied to improvements in its management. Today, I urged all the governments of this region to cooperate fully with this effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, we spoke today about the East African nations' growing political and economic cooperation. The United States strongly supports the East African Community's effort to create a single East African marketplace. It is a reminder that most of the nations and people of East Africa are moving away from conflict and catastrophe, even as they try to resolve the crises in Burundi and Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States will stand with them as they move toward democracy, free markets and integration. And we will continue to work with them as they try to heal the region's remaining wounds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, President of the Republic of Kenya;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the Republic of Uganda;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere, Facilitator of the Burundi Peace Process;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Honourable Warren Christopher, United States Secretary of State;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Honourable Ministers;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excellencies;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Distinguished Guests;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ladies and Gentlemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I returned from a visit to the United States only yesterday, where I addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York, and visited Washington for a series of engagements, meetings and press conferences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my speech at a Working Breakfast hosted by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington on Monday, 7th October, I remarked that the United States Presidential Debate of the previous day had captured the interest and full attention of the entire world, including Tanzania. I said then, and I repeat today, that such world-wide attention on a seemingly purely domestic event is a clear recognition of the leading role of the United States government in the world. For many decisions taken, or not taken, by any U.S. government are likely to impact negatively or positively, constructively or destructively, on events far beyond the shores of the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I said in Washington, and I repeat today in your presence, Mr. Secretary of State, that this recognition of your leadership role in the world carries with it enormous responsibilities. That includes responsibilities in Africa, in the Great Lakes Region, in East Africa, and even in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in the light of the exercise of those responsibilities and duties that we view your current visit, Mr. Secretary of State, to a number of African countries. It is a visit, short as it is, which we highly appreciate.  Africans are renowned for their generosity and welcoming attitude to visitors and guests. We hope you have been received well wherever you have been in our sub-continent, and hopefully in Tanzania as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, your first ever visit to sub-Saharan Africa, must be quite a learning experience for you. You have seen the poverty in the midst of abundant natural resources. You have seen the effects of war and conflict. But, more importantly, you have had the opportunity to talk with African leaders, hearing their analyses of the current problems facing this continent -- a continent that constitutes the cradle of mankind. You have heard directly of their visions and priorities for the future -- for economic development; for good governance; for peace, security and stability; for a more meaningful and rewarding human existence; and for the role they envisage for U.S.  involvement in dealing with these burning issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not often that such an opportunity for dialogue at this, or higher levels, occur between the U.S. Government and those of Africa. I am told you are the third United States Secretary of State to visit sub-Saharan Africa -- following on the steps of Henry Kissinger and James Baker III. When President Clinton came to power four years ago, we in Africa were heartened by policy statements reflecting a new post-cold war interest in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am told that you, Mr. Secretary of State, are the first U.S. Secretary of State ever to devote a full speech to Africa. This was when you addressed the 23rd Meeting of the African-American Conference in May 1993, a conference that was subsequently followed by another first: the holding of the White House Conference on Africa. President Clinton's speech to that Conference, and your own speech to the African-American Conference, all underlined a new impetus for an enhanced interest in Africa by the Clinton Administration. &quot; The Clinton Administration,&quot; you said, &quot;will make Africa a high priority and give it the attention it deserves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I take your current visit to Africa to be an expression of the desire to fulfill that undertaking made over three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You come to Africa at a time when we believe the continent is in transition in both political and economic terms, a transition that leads to the emergence of leaders that come to power through democratic, free and fair elections. These are governments which are more representative of, and more responsive to, the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a representative and responsive government in Africa must of necessity address and respond to the urgent issue of poverty and deprivation facing our people. In other words, democratic and political reforms can only be sustained by equal progress on the economic front, giving governments the resources necessary for rapid economic growth and development that will in turn translate into better lives for the people. Democracy that gallops ahead of socio-economic development will leave in its wake the seeds of violence, instability, and possibly a reversal of the democratic gains made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These democratic gains explain the collective and unanimous position taken by the leaders of the Great Lakes Region to refuse to welcome or underwrite the usurpation of power in Burundi through illegal and unconstitutional means.  Frontiers of military governments should recede further and further from this part of Africa. We believe, by way of sanctions, we can trigger a renewal of a negotiated political settlement of the problems in Burundi, while at the same time sending out a powerful signal on the proper role of the military in Africa as we approach the next century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We took a bold step, at considerable expense to our own economies, in support of the entrenchment of democratic traditions and values in this part of Africa. We look to the old democracies in the world to be on our side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa has also recognized regional co-operation and integration as an important strategy for faster development. The three East African countries of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda have set themselves to reviving East African co- operation. Among other things, we are striving to create a larger economic space in which investors may access larger markets. We have had time to discuss this matter, and I am sure my colleagues will want to discuss it with you after lunch. I believe there is a lot the U.S. government can do to provide that kind and level of assistance needed to increase the pace of East African co-operation. That, we hope, will also translate into increased American private investments in this region. We look forward to substantial U.  S. involvement in contributing to the development of a regional capacity to make our goals a reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe I speak on behalf of my senior colleagues, Presidents Moi and Museveni, when I say we will be ready to work with the U.S. Government in these and other matters of mutual interest. I should also at this point express my deep appreciation for their willingness to come to Arusha in advance of our Great Lakes Summit so that the three of us could be able to exchange views with you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellencies,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ideally, one should not make long speeches at lunch. It is not good for digestion, I am told. But it is not often that I have the U.S. Secretary of State for lunch. So, forgive me for the lengthy interruption of your lunch. I truly look forward to a new era of greater understanding, friendship and co- operation between Africa, especially East Africa, and the United States of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington D.C. - Africare will salute former President Jimmy Carter for his lifetime of humanitarian achievement -- promoting peace and human rights, enabling self-help development initiatives -- at the 1996 Africare Bishop John T. Walker Memorial Dinner on Thursday evening, October 17, at the Sheraton Washington Hotel in Washington, D.C. That same event will feature a celebration of Africare's 25th anniversary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For Africa and for Africare, this will be a momentous occasion,&quot; says Africare President C. Payne Lucas. &quot;Jimmy Carter has contributed so much to Africa. He's helping about a dozen nations on the road to food self- sufficiency. He's addressing Guinea worm disease, river blindness and other causes of ill health. He's easing tensions among nations and between cultural groups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And,&quot; Lucas continues, &quot;Mr Carter's contributions reach far beyond Africa alone. Through his Atlanta-based Carter Center, he has reached people in 65 countries worldwide, including our own. His programs have been outstanding.  Even more remarkable has been Jimmy Carter the person -- for just as he has promoted human dignity, he deeply and genuinely exemplifies that principle.  Jimmy Carter relates to all people, all races, all classes, all nationalities.  We are, therefore, extremely proud to have this opportunity to mount a major tribute to a truly great human being.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The annual Dinner is now the largest benefit in the United States for Africa, with proceeds supporting Africare. The event attracts about 2,500 people and raises about $1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Colin L. Powell, USA (Ret.) and Alma Powell are the 1996 Dinner's National Honorary Patrons. As National Chair this year, Africare is privileged to have Jan Leschly, Chief Executive of SmithKline Beecham. Carter Administration veterans Jody Powell and Valerie Pinson are serving as the event's General Chairs. Sam Donaldson will emcee. Andrew Young will make the award presentation to Mr. Carter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event attracts notables in the U.S. government and in international and corporate circles, from heads of state to leaders of the Fortunate 500 and almost the entire African diplomatic corps in Washington. Past speakers have included President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, President Nelson Mandela, then-President Nicephore Soglo of Benin, the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum and South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founded in 1971, Africare is the oldest and largest African-American organization specializing in aid to Africa. Africare has carried out several thousand programs, reaching millions of people, in 35 nations Africa-wide over the past quarter-century. Today, Africare has about 150 programs in 28 nations, from Egypt to South Africa. Africare's work is in food, water, the environment, health and emergency humanitarian aid as well as enterprise development and governance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The Ministry of Education yesterday announced that it has issued and distributed new statute on the establishment and licensing of community and private schools run by foreign organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the statute was issued with the purpose of helping the ministry oversee that licensed community and other schools established by foreign organizations perform their duties respecting the country's constitution as well as other laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Existing community and other private schools should get their licenses within 12 months after the enforcement of the new statute, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry said existing community schools starting from the coming, Ethiopian year could not enrol new students unless they obtain licenses according to regulation No. 206/1987 of the Council of Ministers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need for issuing the new statue arose due to actions taken by community schools in contravention of the objectives for their establishment in enrolling Ethiopian students and charging them high tuition fees, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was indispensable to oversee the community schools whether they accomplished their duties regardless of creed, political views and cultural influences in line with the educational and training policy the country adheres to, he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department head also attached special importance to the active participation of parents in facilitating the administration of schools establishing new schools and expanding existing ones.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The discrepancy between demographic growth and agricultural production in the past 20 years in Africa has resulted in the decline of per capita food production. The Food and Agriculture Organization(FAO) said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued in connection with the World Food Day to be observed next Wednesday, FAO said agricultural output grew at the rate of about 1.9 per cent a year in sub-Saharan Africa between 1970 and 1990 with the region's population growth rate, one of the highest in the world, averaged three per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasons for this widening gap between nutritional needs and available food are many, including an external debt that according to the World Bank, rose from about 84 million in 1980 to 289 billion dollars in 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drought ,disease, pests, lack of adequate irrigation, firtlizer and other inputs and environmental degradation are among the impediments that exacerbate the pressing donations, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed conflicts have compounded the problem, it said adding of the 32 million people who received assistance from the World Food Programme (WFP) in 1994. 21.5 million were African and of these, nearly two-thirds were victims of war and civil striate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report to the 19th FAO African regional conference warned saying &quot;unless adequate policy measures are taken, with the utmost commitment and urgency on the part of national governments and the international community, the already disastrous situation facing many countries risks reaching unmanageable dimensions&quot;, the statement added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dedicated to the theme, &quot;fighting hunger and malnutrition,&quot; World Food Day will serve to remind people everywhere that without adequate food the call for economic and social development will be in vain and there can be no real peace for millions of Africa's poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture is a key sector in most African countries, employing about 63 per cent of the labour force and contributes 20 per cent of the gross domestic product of sub-Saharan Africa, the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project formulation, management training winds up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEBREZEIT (ENA) - The project designing and management training devoted to building the capacity of regions in project formulation and implementation wound up here Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The training at which some 90 agricultural professionals drawn from Tigray, Afar, Somali, Benishangul-Gumuz, Southern People's Gambella and Harari regional states took part was aimed at addressing shortage of skilled manpower in project designing and implementation, coordinator of the training said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Projects in the agricultural sector in general were weak and slow for reasons related to mismanagement, low involvement of the public and designing shortcomings, Vice Minister of Agriculture Getachew Tekle-Medhin told the trainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vice minister, after handing over certificates, said production of competent professionals in project designing and management is pivotal in mitigating constraints encountered during project implementation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 4000 agricultural professionals have received trainings last year through the national agricultural development programme on various fields including extension, technology transfer and dissemination, project designing and implementation, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of farmers embraced by the extension programme has increased to 350, 000 in 1988/1989 E.C. from 32,000 in 1987/1988 E.C he said, adding presently the country has boosted production by four-fold than it used to harvest previously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior consultant and development management department head in the Ethiopian Management Institute Alemayhu Assefa said the trainees have taken among others, courses on project formulation, supervision and assessment, public participation, marketing and financial and economic analysis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The Attorney General in the United States announced the breaking up of a major international drug smuggling ring that has been shipping heroine from the Far East to the United States in the past 15 years, said the British Broadcasting Corporation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some time now, Americans have been coming to South Africa to celebrate with you the end of apartheid. That has been our great privilege, and it is mine, too. But we have new work to do. The victory of freedom has opened new challenges for your people. It has also opened an opportunity that our nations must grasp: the opportunity to act together to advance common interests in Africa and around the world. That is why today I want to speak about America's engagement on this continent and to explain why peace, democracy, and prosperity in Africa matter to the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wanted to give this speech in South Africa because your example has inspired Americans and the world. Today, people look at South Africa and say: If this diverse, once-divided nation can be united by the common values and aims of its people, then so can any multi-ethnic nation in Africa and the world. If South Africa can forge a community of interest with the neighbors it once fought, then any region can come together. If South Africa can elect a former political prisoner to be its President, if it can tell the truth about its past and move forward, so can any nation striving to overcome a painful legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When people say that South Africa is a leader, it is not just a testament to your size and economic might. It is a tribute to the courage, patience, and tolerance that you have shown in your remarkable transition. It is a tribute to the optimism you inspire in others, through Africa and around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, all the nations of Africa have a chance to realize the potential in their human and natural resources. This was impossible when Africa was divided by Cold War cleavages and superpower rivalries. It was impossible when most African nations stagnated under single-party rule, pursuing economic policies that were based on ideology, not experience. It was impossible when South Africa stood in opposition to its neighbors, unable to exercise moral or political leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is possible today because all over the world, people are recognizing the truth Robert Kennedy expressed in South Africa 30 years ago: that our &quot; essential humanity can only be protected and preserved where government must answer, not just to the wealthy, not just to those of a particular religion, or a particular race, but all its people.&quot; The triumph of that democratic ideal ended the Cold War. It overcame apartheid. And in country after country, it is empowering Africans to shape their destiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, when we talk about Africa's renewed promise, we must not gloss over the tragic problems of those nations still in crisis. Nor can we underestimate the devastation caused by poverty, environmental neglect, unsustainable population growth, and disease. We dare not overlook the persistence of human rights abuses or the continued existence of injustices like slavery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot speak about Africa without recognizing its great diversity. But many African nations have this in common: that they are at a crossroads. Many countries have ended violence, but not yet established conditions for lasting peace. Many have held elections, but not yet solidified the rule of law. Many are freeing their economies from the shackles of state control, but have not yet been able to free their people from poverty. In other words, much of Africa is at a fragile midpoint, the point at which good leadership, sound policies, and steady international support and engagement can make the greatest difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All nations must cooperate, not compete, if we are going to make a positive difference in Africa's future. The time has passed when Africa could be carved into spheres of influence, or when outside powers could view whole groups of states as their private domain. Today, Africa needs the support of all its many friends, not the exclusive patronage of a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States will do its part, not only because it is right, but because it is in our interest to help Africa succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need African partners in our effort to meet global challenges. African nations played a leading role in extending the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Without the efforts of democracies like Benin and South Africa, we might have lost our most important barrier against the spread of nuclear weapons. Likewise, without the nearly unanimous support of African nations, we might not have gained the U.N. General Assembly's approval of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need African partners if we are to dismantle the global networks of crime, narcotics, and terror that are gaining a foothold here. The health and prosperity of Americans depend on preserving the global environment, and we can only do that if we are engaged in Africa. America, like the whole world, has an interest in preserving Africa's tropical forests, which have given us effective treatments for leukemia and Hodgkin's Disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We clearly have an interest in helping Africa realize its immense and mostly untapped economic potential. As Africa's regions come together, as its nations become more stable and free, opportunities for investment and trade will only grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our late Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, understood this. No one ever worked harder or with more success to broaden and diversify our trade and investment relationship with Africa, including southern Africa, which he named one of the ten top emerging markets in the world. We are carrying on his work. U.S.  trade with sub-Saharan Africa grew by 12% last year. Our exports already exceed those to the former Soviet Union. Here in South Africa, one new American company is starting or expanding its operations every week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also recognize our interest in helping Africa resolve the conflicts that stand in the way of a better future. Crisis after crisis has taught us that the cost of prevention is never as great as the price of neglect, that lifting lives is even more rewarding than saving lives. The American people respond with generosity when a humanitarian emergency sears our conscience.  But if together we succeed in being peace-makers and democracy-builders, we will not be called upon to provide emergency relief nearly as often, and that is surely in our interest and Africa's as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all these reasons, President Clinton is determined to intensify American engagement in Africa. In the last four years, in a tough budgetary climate, he has sought to protect our assistance to Africa, even as aid to other regions declined sharply. We have provided $600 million to support South Africa's transition. We have helped nations like Mali and Benin consolidate democracy. We launched an initiative to prevent conflict and achieve food security in the Greater Horn of Africa. We have been deeply engaged in support of peace in Mozambique and Angola. Our armed forces provided critical support for relief in Rwanda and they helped save hundreds of thousands of lives in Somalia. We are the world's leading supporter of eliminating landmines in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will not pretend to you that there is no debate in America about Africa's relative importance. But my trip to Africa this past week has only strengthened my conviction that America must remain engaged on this continent.  I intend to build on the experiences of this visit and to draw on its lessons to make that case to the American people. We cannot and will not walk away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our approach to Africa is to promote democracy, to prevent conflict, to encourage economic prosperity and integration, and to support sustainable development. These elements are inseparable. Political freedom is the key to peace within nations. Economies perform best where people are free to shape their destiny. But democracy itself cannot thrive in nations divided by armed conflict or crippled by dwindling natural resources. Let me discuss each element of our approach in turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is to promote democratic government, human rights, and the rule of law. I can remember when apologists for colonialism argued that Africa was not developed enough to be &quot;ready&quot; for democracy. Sadly, many African leaders have used the same excuse to justify dictatorship. But now the tide is turning. Since 1989, more than 20 nations have embraced democratic government, rejecting what Mali's President Konare has condemned as &quot;the logic of 'shut up and obey.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rise of democracy means that Africans are finally gaining a chance to solve problems and to shape their future. In southern Africa, drought has not led to catastrophe in part because most governments in this region are held accountable by their voters and by a free press. Democracy makes it more likely that internal divisions will be settled peacefully at the ballot box.  That has been possible in emerging democracies like Mozambique and Namibia, unlike in dictatorships such as Sudan. Democracy makes it more likely that business people will invest, because they will have more confidence that the law will protect their investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, democracy means more than elections. It depends on a free press, independent courts, and a public culture in which every person can participate fully in political and community life. In the last four years, American assistance has helped women's groups get involved in politics, helped human rights advocates gain a voice, and defended independent journalists. We support institutions that establish accountability for past abuses, like South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This morning I was pleased to sign an agreement on behalf of the United States that will provide $400,000 for the Commission's work. We are the world's leading supporter of the Rwanda War Crimes Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Soglo of Benin is right that Africa can't afford to be held to a lesser democratic standard by the world. Nigeria's oppressive rule is especially troubling. Nigeria should be a leader in Africa. But its rulers have squandered their nation's potential and made it the poorest oil-rich country on earth. The effects of corruption and drug trafficking in Nigeria can already be felt from South Africa to North America. The United States hopes that the Nigerian government will move forward with political and economic reform. We are open to dialogue with its leaders. But we are prepared to take appropriate steps if repression continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When democracy is threatened, its fate depends in part on the will of other nations to defend it. Already, many African leaders have recognized that national boundaries must not shield abuses that threaten whole regions. As I said at the OAU two days ago in Addis Ababa, by acting together African nations can effectively vindicate the principle that democracy must be safeguarded, that military coups are unacceptable, and that election results must be respected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second element of our approach is to work with African nations to resolve Africa's remaining armed conflicts and to prevent new ones. In Africa's Great Lakes region, the United States and South Africa are working with regional leaders to avert renewed genocide. I was in Arusha yesterday to support the efforts to achieve a negotiated solution to the crisis in Burundi.  I had an opportunity to discuss this issue with President Mandela this morning. Our goal is to achieve an agreement that will restore democracy and protect minority rights. In Angola, which I will visit Monday, we are also working to resolve the war that has raged there for a generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our experience in Angola has demonstrated the essential role the United Nations can play in resolving conflict. We are determined to meet our responsibilities to the U.N. We are striving to improve its effectiveness and strengthen its leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like other regions, Africa also needs strong regional and sub-regional organizations, like SADC (Southern Africa Development Community), that can take responsibility, in partnership with Africa's friends abroad, at moments of crisis. It needs well-trained regional forces that can be deployed rapidly when and where they are needed for humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. It needs a mechanism that combines the experience of Africa's armed forces with the resources and capabilities of its non-African partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To meet this need, we are working with our partners in Africa and around the world to create an African Crisis Response Force. This concept is not new, but it is necessary. It allows us to realize a goal that the OAU has espoused and other nations have long shared: to build Africa's capacity for resolving conflict -- just as we have done in many other regions of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crisis in Burundi adds urgency to the creation of such a force. But it could meet Africa's long-term needs as well. It can help ensure that neither my country nor any African nation will ever face a choice between acting alone at times of crisis or doing nothing. I am happy to say that a number of African nations have already expressed their willingness to contribute to such a force. Based on the results of my trip, I am increasingly confident that an African Crisis Response Force can, indeed, be created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third element of our approach is to help Africa realize its economic potential. Many countries in Africa have acted to reduce budget deficits, privatize enterprises, and deregulate economies. These are hard steps -- in Africa and everywhere else in the world. But they are the only path to sustained growth and rising living standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States strongly supports the efforts of the international financial institutions to help African nations succeed on this path, and President Clinton is seeking adequate funding for this work. We also helped to forge the consensus donor nations reached last month to relieve more of the debt owed by the world's poorest countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We applaud the World Bank's greater focus on education because education is critical to economic development. There is no good reason why the donor community and African countries cannot work together to help every child in every country benefit from a full primary education by the year 2010.  Development also depends on unleashing the talents of all of Africa's people.  Africa's women, in particular, must gain full access to every school, clinic, and parliament if the continent is to tap its full potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States also strongly supports the new measures that the World Bank and IMF (International Monetary Fund) will be taking against corruption around the world. The private sector can only thrive when ordinary citizens are not forced to pay bribes for basic services, when contracts are awarded fairly, and foreign investors are not intimidated. Fighting corruption is a global challenge. It is also an African challenge. We are encouraged by the priority that African democracies like Tanzania are giving to rooting out these corrosive practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should also work together to help Africa become more integrated with the global economy. Thirty-two sub-Saharan African nations have joined the new World Trade Organization, and we are helping them to share its benefits and to meet its requirements. In this region, SADC is eliminating duties and non- tariff barriers. We encourage it to work with its counterparts in East and West Africa to liberalize trade throughout the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final element of our approach is to overcome the transnational problems that undermine democracy, peace, and prosperity. African nations will prosper only if their economies grow faster than their population. Africa's economies will only grow if they manage wisely the forests, grasslands, waters, and wildlife that are fundamental to every industry from agriculture to tourism to manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When some people look at the massive social and environmental pressures Africa faces, they predict anarchy and chaos. They think violence is the inevitable consequence of environmental decay, disease, and population growth.  These forces are destructive. But I believe that human neglect and unaccountable government are the most important causes of the human disasters we have seen in countries like Liberia. Genocide is not a natural disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am convinced, as President John Kennedy once said, that &quot;problems created by man can be solved by man.&quot; During my trip this week, I have been inspired by the men and women I met who are struggling to meet Africa's greatest challenges and succeeding. Thanks to them, infant survival rates, life expectancy, and literacy are steadily rising. Thanks to them, a higher proportion of Africa's lands are set aside for protection than anywhere in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States stands with them. In Africa, our Agency for International Development is placing particular emphasis on sustainable development. When I was in Addis Ababa earlier this week, I visited a community where we are working with local people to pave streets, fix bridges, and create economic opportunity. When I was in Mali, I visited our young Peace Corps volunteers, who are working with villagers to plant trees and to keep drinking water safe in an area threatened by the desert. Any American who saw what I saw this week would be proud of our country's role on this continent and just as determined as I am to preserve it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goals I have talked about -- democracy, peace, prosperity, and sustainable development -- are goals I know the United States and South Africa share. I also know that South Africa faces great challenges at home -- from the old quest to assure justice and opportunity for all, to the new urgency of fighting crime and narcotics. The most important thing South Africa can do for Africa and the world is to ensure that its own transformation succeeds. We remain optimistic about the future of the South African economy and its leadership. But I know you do not believe your responsibility ends at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa has already made great progress in promoting regional cooperation and peace in Southern Africa. SADC has been a tremendous success and under President Mandela's leadership it will only grow stronger. But even this region is not where your national interest ends. After all, no one wants the nations that we once called the &quot;front line states&quot; to find themselves on a new front line, facing instability and poverty to the north. That is why we applaud President Mandela's courageous leadership on human rights and South Africa's growing engagement in the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is an important global partner for the United States, too.  Your nation has provided decisive leadership against nuclear proliferation.  We share an interest in fighting terrorism, drugs, and crime and protecting the global environment. The Binational Commission chaired by Deputy President Mbeki and Vice President Gore has already put many of these practical issues on our common agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I look around the world, I see very few countries with greater potential to help shape the 21st century than the new South Africa. I see few relationships as vital to advancing our common interests as the U.S.-South Africa relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our nations are linked by so much shared history, so many shared values, and so many common aspirations. You have struggled to become what Bishop Tutu calls &quot;the rainbow people of God.&quot; In America, we have struggled, in the words of Martin Luther King, &quot;to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.&quot; For all our remaining problems, our examples still inspire the world. Nations look to us to exercise principled leadership. Let us continue to heed their call.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC has noted the acquittal of the accused in the Magnus Malan trial by the Durban Supreme Court on Friday 11 October 1996. The ANC will study the judgment and make a more detailed response in due course.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC nonetheless, unequivocally accepts and respects the decision of the Supreme court in this regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people of our country who fought against apartheid and made many sacrifices expect that there should be proper investigations into the activities of hitsquads including those of members of the former National Party government who may be implicated in such activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, questions, have arisen as to why the KwaZulu/Natal Attorney- General Adv. Tim McNally decided to prosecute Malan and others without ensuring that there was adequate evidence placed before the court. Questions have also been raised about the manner in which the prosecution was conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC expresses its appreciation for the tireless efforts of the police officers who investigated the matter in an effort to find the perpetrators of such heinous acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1990 and 1994 both KwaZulu/Natal and various urban centres in Gauteng were subjected to an unprecedented wave of political violence perpetrated by gangs of killers who to this day remain undetected and unknown.  It remains a task of the police service to pursue these investigations with rigour so that the perpetrators are brought to justice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - South Africa has indicated that it is not opposed in principle to the United States proposal for an African peacekeeping force manned by Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Secretary of State Warren Christopher is in South Africa to urge the country's participation in an African Crises Response Force of between 5, 000 and 10,000 troops from several African nations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The force -- to be trained, equipped and sponsored by the United States and rich western countries -- would be used for rapid deployment into African conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher has obtained support for the force from Mali and Ethiopia on his current African tour, and his assistant, George Moose, is understood to have persuaded several other African countries to join the project during an African tour in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But South African participation is regarded as crucial, and the American proposal faltered slightly last week after President Nelson Mandela's remark that Africa would like to feel they are handling things themselves -- not acting in response to suggestions from outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the apparently cool South African response, deputy foreign minister Aziz Pahad has said that the government is not opposed in principle to South Africa participating in such a force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that similar proposals had already been made by the Organisation of African Unity and the Southern African Development Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has estimated that it would cost between 25-million and 40-million U.S. dollars to establish the African force, but South Africa wants greater clarity on the precise allocation of costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concern is that, although western countries might foot the bill for deploying the force into trouble spots, it is not clear who would pay for actual operational costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairperson, and Dr. Alex Boraine, vice-chairperson of the Truth And Reconciliation Commission, October 11, 1996, on the outcome of the Malan trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court has weighed up the evidence, the accused have been found not guilty, and we certainly would not quarrel with its decision. But the outcome of the proceedings demonstrates our conviction that the processes of the Commission offer a better prospect of establishing the truth about our past than criminal trials.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For it is very unlikely that many convictions would be secured if the State was to attempt to prosecute the perpetrators of human rights violations from all sides for the crimes of the past 30 years. In this case, the State has not succeeded in securing a guilty verdict in spite of spending an estimated R7 million, and spending months and months leading evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would nevertheless be very unwise for perpetrators waiting in the wings to think that the outcome of this trial offers them any reassurance. The Motherwell and De Kock cases give the lie to the suggestion that because people were acquitted in this case, all perpetrators can breathe a sigh of relief. Developments around the Commission in the next few weeks are likely to indicate that. It is important for perpetrators to come to the Commission before they face the alternative of being prosecuted in a court of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission has not yet decided whether it will conduct its own investigation into the issues raised in the Malan trial, and a final decision would depend on our resources and an evaluation of priorities by our regions.  But as with any other investigation, if we were to go ahead we would not hesitate to invite or subpoena those involved in this trial, including those who have been acquitted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher arrived in Luanda, the Angolan capital, Monday on the last stage of his five-nation African trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is expected to hold talks with President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos and take part in a special meeting of Angola's Joint Committee, the body charged with implementing the country's peace accord between the government and former rebels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement between Luanda and former anti-government rebels, UNITA, was signed Nov. 20, 1994 in the Zambian capital, Lusaka.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Implementation of the deal should feature in Christopher's talks with the Angolan authorities. He is also to table before them the U.S. proposal for an African crises response force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal is for the force to be manned by Africans and funded by the United States and some European countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea has received a mixed reaction from the countries visited by Christopher: Mali, Ethiopia, Tanzania and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mali and Ethiopia have supported the idea, but South Africa has expressed reservations, although it says the idea is good in principle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The European Union (E.U), will follow the stand taken by President Nelson Mandela of South Africa regarding the American proposal for the formation of an African crises intervention force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was confirmed Sunday by E.U. Trade Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro in the Namibian capital of Windhoek where he arrived for the Southern African Development Community-European Union ministerial conference.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the E.U. would support a United Nations, Organisation of African Unity or regional initiative for conflict resolution in Africa but not the proposed American initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. proposal is for a force of between 5,000 and 10,000 manned by Africans and funded by the United States and its Western allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conflict resolution is on the agenda of the SADC-EU conference, and Pinheiro said he would propose that this issue be tackled immediately to prevent any further eruption of violence in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the major players must be the Africans themselves, with the E.U.  providing technical and financial support,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this background, the U.S. proposal seems unlikely to succeed and SADC members are expected to express their further concerns at the Windhoek conference Monday and Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SADC Executive-Secretary Kaire Mbuende says the community is concerned about the increasing militarization of peace processes. Members fear that peacekeeping could become a new forum for militarization and arms buildup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbuende added that SADC countries had, through the decolonization process, developed skills for dealing with ethnic conflict and would now like a greater role in African conflict resolution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahdi, has strongly criticized a higher education policy adopted by the government of Gen. Omar Bashir, saying it would lead to the destruction of higher education in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahdi, whose government was toppled by Bashir in a bloodless coup d'etat in June 1989, was quoted Monday by the daily Al Rai Alaam as saying the new educational policies has &quot;led to a catastrophe.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bashir seized power, there were only three universities in the Sudan, in addition to the Khartoum-based Cairo University. The annual intake was about 3,500 students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years after coming to power, Bashir increased the number of universities to 20, with an annual intake of over 33,000 students. But this has been at the expense of what some higher education experts called &quot;quality&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new policy has also scrapped a system of free accommodation and feeding offered to students. Instead, most students are now obliged to pay high entry fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Students are now facing the severest educational and living conditions ever,&quot; asserted the former premier, the only senior politician from the dissolved political parties to have stayed in the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahdi, head of the outlawed Umma political party, said the new policy has made many a university lecturer leave the country. An average university professor salary, minus allowances, is currently put at about 40,000 Sudanese pounds a month (about 28.50 U.S. dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He complained that lack of proper labs, libraries and housing has &quot;made all live in a state of loss and calamity&quot; at the Sudanese universities, the daily quoted him as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of PhD holders, teaching assistants, and lecturers are now quitting the country each week, mainly to go to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 658 million cfa francs (500 cfa = 1 USD) has been released for the creation of a motorized health brigade, cleaning of gutters and equipping the town with public dust bins, latrines and rest rooms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From now on, Abidjan's big markets will be closed two days a week from 2.30 pm (14.30 GMT), to allow their cleaning up and maintenance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A first operation, to remove the vendors, has already been carried out and a second one will be launched later this month. The two operations requires not less than 572 million cfa francs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight against weeds growing in lagoon waters is also targeted.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (PANA) - Experts from the Congolese ministry of water</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and forests and forest managers agreed Sunday in Brazzaville on the reform of the forest policy in Congo, by adopting a new forest code defining this policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The code, replacing the one adopted in January 1974, includes five types of contracts -- development contracts, development-improvement contracts, conversion-improvement contracts, industrial conversion contracts, and special permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the new policy, forest lease lasts a maximum 20 years, indefinitely renewable. However, development titles will be only given to persons of good morals, according to Congolese law, or persons of Congolese citizenship.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any contract holder is now compelled to earmark the number of trees to develop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This provision is very important in order to put an end to the forest managers' anarchy, who did not hesitate to cut trees beyond the limits of their properties&quot;, said water and forest department director, Rogobert Ebondzo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new forest code also establisheS a forest fund, financed by the sale of forest products, taxes and grants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund will finance forestry and reforestation activities and the implementation of a forest development plan. The code also provides for a fine of 20.000 cfa (40 U.S. dollars) to 10 million cfa (20,000 dollars), for the anarchic destruction of forests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The code recommends the conversion of forest products in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The benefit of the measure is that now exports will concern only finished or semi-finished goods and no longer raw materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We therefore benefit from the increase in value contrary to the former 1974 code recommending a 50 percent conversion, which were not applied by forest managers&quot;, added Ebondzo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new forest code will be revised by the government before being submitted to the parliament for possible adoption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congo, which has about 20 million hectares of forest, exports annually 600, 000 cubic meters of rough timber and 400,000 cubic meters of eucalyptus logs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besenczon was killed by car thieves on Sept. 30, in an attack mounted in broad daylight at Tsalala, about 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) from central Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armenio Panguene, head of the information and planning department of the Maputo Provincial Police Command, told the radio that the vehicle, a four- wheel drive Toyota, was recovered last week in Matola, the industrial town that adjoins Maputo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panguene said before recovering the vehicle, the police intercepted a group of suspected thieves who opened fire on the police unit. One of the gunmen was killed in the shootout while his companions escaped. He said the group may be connected with the death of the Swiss which is being investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police also claim to have captured three people who took part in the murder of the well-known Mozambican artist, Eugenio de Lemos, in March, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lemos' body was discovered on a patch of wasteland near the Costa Do Sol beach. The motive for his murder, as in the case of Besenczon, was car theft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the suspects have been in detention for several months, but a police source said Monday the third, a man named as Carlitos Armacao, was arrested on Saturday night in the Maputo suburb of Jardim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armacao has confessed to the crime and told the police that shortly after the murder he went to South Africa, where he remained until a few weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, on Monday morning armed robbers attacked a vehicle belonging to a soft drinks and confectionery company, Loumar, stealing some 55 million meticais (about 4,900 U.S. dollars), witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They added that the attack took place just 100 meters (109 yards) from the factory gates, as the vehicle was heading to the bank to deposit the money.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) says it needs to consult widely with member states and the United Nations on the modalities and sustenance of a proposed All-African Crises Response Force before any commitments can be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Western countries, including United States, France and Britain, had offered to finance the establishment of African conflict prevention force, many questions still remained unanswered, O.A.U. Assistant Secretary-General Ahmed Haggag said Monday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is need for more information and wide-ranging consultations on what Africa has to do, the modalities and deployment of such a force and immediate payments for the deployments,&quot; said Haggag, adding that peace-keeping operations were very costly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was addressing some 40 senior military officers from Southern Africa who are attending a two-week regional peace-keeping course at Zimbabwe's army headquarters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The O.A.U., which has played major roles in settlements of conflicts in Africa, says there are several constraints to its initiatives. These include prohibitive costs of deploying troops and their upkeep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations, for example, spent 1.5 billion U.S. dollars on the Rwanda peace-keeping mission which, Haggag said, African states could not mobilize given a similar conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also the legal limitation that arose from the membership of O.A.  U. states in the United Nations, forcing them to adhere to the rule that international peace and security was the responsibility of the U.N. alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will need to coordinate all the proposals that have been made by the Western countries and then consult with member states while the U.N. has to answer all underlying questions,&quot; said Haggag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said the O.A.U. had in the past experienced a number of difficulties in mobilisation, logistics and funding of peace-keeping missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In view of the current limitations, the O.A.U. was concentrating on conflict prevention which, Haggag said, started with preventive diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a database was being prepared on each of the 53 member countries featuring profiles of personalities who could serve as representatives of the O.A.U. secretary-general and provide information on elections monitoring, effects of conflict situation and initiatives on conflict resolutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's conflicts have created the highest number of political refugees and displaced persons in the world, standing at seven million, which is 45 percent of the world refugee population.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - Roberto Garreton, the Commission on Human Rights' Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Zaire, began today a new visit to the country. Over the course of the two-week mission he will meet with several officials of the Zairean Government and query them on human- matters and on the ethnic conflict in the region of Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also will meet with humanitarian organizations, human-rights groups, and various representatives of civil society. In addition, he will travel to the interior of the country, notably to Lubumbashi, Goma, and Bukavu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest report of Mr. Garreton, officially released this week, focuses on the situation in the northern Kivu region (E/CN.4/1997/6/Add.1). In this study, which followed a mission he carried out in July 1996 and included a trip to bordering Rwanda, he outlines the aggravation of ethnic conflicts in Kivu, in particular in the area of Masisi and Rutshuru. The Special Rapporteur reviews in the document the state of ethnic tension between Tutsis and Hutus installed in Zairean refugee camps which resulted in numerous cases of violence, pillaging, and the setting of fires in which the armed security forces of Zaire had participated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deploring the violence which had led to a great number of victims, injuries, breaches of security and damage to property, to violations of other rights, and to population displacements, and for which he cites as partly responsible the Zairean State, the Zairean political class, certain ethnic leaders, certain human-rights organizations, and the international community, the Special Rapporteur exhorts the State and the people of Zaire to show tolerance for Rwandan ethnic groups seeking sanctuary in Zaire, to find an adequate solution to the problem of nationality, and asks the international community not to ignore a situation which could worsen into an tragedy with results as grave as those encountered in Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Special Rapporteur adds that he is concerned by a deterioration of ethnic relations in the south of Kivu and warns of a worsening of the human- rights situation in the east of Zaire. He further recommends that the Commission on Human Rights consider holding a special session to find solutions to ethnic tensions prevailing in the Great Lakes region of Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - This is number 30 (7-13 October 1996) in a series of weekly reports from IRIN on general developments in the Great Lakes region. Sources for the information below include UN agencies, NGOs, other international organisations and media reports. IRIN issues these reports for the benefit of the humanitarian community, but accepts no responsibility as to the accuracy of the original sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weekly Roundup of Main Events in the Great Lakes region</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Some 19,000 refugees fled from a camp near Uvira, eastern Zaire on Sunday following an attack on the camp by armed men, described by local media as &quot; Zairean Tutsis&quot;. The gunmen are reported to have killed four refugees and injured nine others in Runingo camp. The refugees have mostly fled into two neighbouring refugee camps. As of late Sunday, there were no reports of movement into Rwanda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since early September, the area around Uvira has been wracked by violent clashes between the Zairean army, local tribes and the Banyamulenge (ethnic Tutsis). The UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Zaire, Roberto Garreton, warned on Friday that violence would continue to escalate &quot;if the international community failed to intervene to end government-sponsored massacres&quot;. Calling for a military observer force to be dispatched to the region, Garreton said that if the political situation in Zaire explodes, its consequences will be far greater even than the crises in Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rapporteur was sharply critical of Zaire which he said &quot;has been directly involved in and has incited people to commit such violations and has not made sufficient effort either to prevent or restrain them&quot;. On Thursday, the UN Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali called on Zairean authorities and the Banyamulenge to restore calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean troops and local residents are said to have mounted &quot;witch hunts&quot; for the Banyamulenge in Uvira and Bukavu after the deputy Governor of South Kivu announced on 8 October that the estimated 300,000 Banyamulenge had one week to leave or be hunted down as rebels. Earlier in the week Zairean soldiers went on a looting spree in Uvira town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean government has declared a state of war in South Kivu and has accused the Banyamulenge of attempting to destabilise Zaire, of raising an army and of attempting to secede from Zaire. The Zairean government also alleges that Rwanda and Burundi are supporting the Banyamulenge. Both countries have denied their involvement. About a dozen aid workers left Uvira on Sunday for a rest in Nairobi - the third such group to leave in less than a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda's President, Pasteur Bizimungu, says that Rwanda will allow Banyamulenge women and children into the country but will block the arrival of Banyamulenge men. &quot;Zaire needs to accept that the Banyamulenge are also Zaireans&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in North Kivu, meanwhile, was reported to be calm over the weekend after last week's fighting. About 10,000 local people were internally displaced as result of attacks by the Bangilima on Bambu village and surrounding settlements. The displaced, mainly ethnic Hutus, took shelter in Rutshuru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* US Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, told a news conference in Tanzania that it was safe for Hutu refugees to return to Rwanda and that their camps in Zaire and Tanzania should be closed. In a written statement issued after the news conference, Christopher said that the refugees should be enouraged to return home voluntarily. &quot;We believe it is time to close the camps closest to the Rwandan border that pose the greatest security threat&quot;, he said. Zaire welcomed the call for the closure of the camps and said it was now up to international agencies to help avert forced repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Regional leaders decided at the weekend to maintain sanctions against Burundi and gave its opposing factions one month to open talks or face further penalties. The Regional Summit, held in Arusha on Saturday, brought together the Presidents of Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia, the prime ministers of Ethiopia and Zaire and the Secretary-General of the Organisation of African Unity. Also present in Arusha were the former Tanzanian president, Julius Nyerere and observers from the US government, the European Union, the UN and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regional leaders rejected a US suggestion to ease sanctions, but agreed to send a team to Burundi to assess Buyoya's commitment to returning democratic order and holding peace talks. The team is due to arrive in Bujumbura on Tuesday. In its final communique, the leaders warned of &quot; appropriate measures&quot; against any group or faction that refused to participate in talks or placed obstacles in the way of the process. Buyoya and the leader of Burundi's National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), Leonard Nyangoma, have both written to Nyerere saying that they are ready to enter into open negotiations. However, the leader of Burundi's main Tutsi-dominated party, UPRONA, said on Sunday that the party was opposed to holding talks with Hutu rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the beginning of sanctions on 31 July, Buyoya has met two of the three demands made by regional leaders - the reopening of parliament and the unbanning of political parties. The military regime is reported to have reacted angrily to the continuation of sanctions and has accused African leaders of &quot;undermining peace and having a secret agenda&quot;. Buyoya was not invited to the Summit, but had appealed for an easing or lifting of sanctions.  The embargo makes some exemptions for the delivery of humanitarian aid, including seeds and fertiliser, but blocks all imports and exports as well as commercial flights. No changes were announced to the sanctions during the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Burundi Army has accused rebels of killing about 40 villagers in the southwestern province of Bururi on Friday. The attack, described as one of the worst since the 25 July coup d'etat, is said to have taken place at Burambi, some 50 kilometres south of Bujumbura. The Army says that most of the victims were women, children and old people. Tens of thousands of local peple are reported to be displaced as a result of fighting in Bururi, and in the northern province of Kayanza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The OAU said on Thursday that it broadly welcomed the US proposal to create an inter-African Crisis Response Force. US Secretary of State, Warren Christopher presented the plan to OAU Ambassadors in Addis Ababa. The plan calls for a 10,000 strong inter-African force which would set up safe havens for civilians during conflicts on the continent. The OAU has asked for clarification on who would command the new force and has expressed concern about the issue of substainable (financial) support for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to US sources, a number of African nations, including Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Mali, have accepted the principle of supplying troops, while the US, Belgium, Britain, Canada, and Ireland have promised financial or training support. Prior to the 25 July coup, Kenya had distanced herself from a proposal calling for a regional military peace-keeping force to intervene in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rwanda's former Minister of Interior, Seth Sendashonga, denounced the &quot; exportation of state terrorism&quot; after two prominent Rwandans - a former Rwandan colonel and a businessman - were assassinated in Kenya. Colonel Theoneste Lizinde, who had defected from the RPF last December, and Augustin Bugilimfura, the owner of a print shop in Kigali, went missing in Nairobi on Sunday evening. Their bodies were found on Tuesday about 20 kilometres north of Nairobi. Both victims were shot in the mouth. Sendashonga, who was himself shot and wounded in Nairobi in February, said that the murders &quot;exposed the bloodstained RPF regime&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The United States announced on Friday a grant of US$ 650,000 for the UN International Tribunal to assist the Tribunal prosecute those accused of mass rape and other sexual crimes during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. The Tribunal, based in Arusha, Tanzania has indicted so far 21 people accused on charges related to the genocide. The US Government has already contributed US$ 5 million to the Tribunal's costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Blood donations in Kenya have fallen by 50% in 13 years and available stocks represent only a third of the national requirement. Statistics from the Blood Donor Centre indicate that the present national stock is 75,000 half litre units. The country's demand is estimated at 240,000 units, mainly for surgery, including for victims of road accidents and treatment of certain diseases. Some patients, mostly children, are reported to have died from lack of blood transfusions. The blood donor slump is attributed to fears by potential donors that they will be diagnosed HIV positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rebels of the West Nile Bank Front operating in Uganda attacked a missionary hospital and two High Schools at the weekend, looting equipment and damaging the properties. The Ugandan Army is reported to have killed some 25 rebels near the Zairean border after repulsing the attackers. Some 200 rebels are said to have been involved. Eye-witnesses said that more than 300 villagers fled the area during the attack. The raids come within the same week as the Lord's Resistence Army (LRA) rebels abducted 150 high school girls from Aboke in the northern region of the country. About 60 of the hostages escaped when the rebels came under attack from government forces.  Sixty more were released on Friday. Uganda has accused Sudan of arming the rebels and Zaire of allowing them to operate from its territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* South African President Nelson Mandela was awarded Uganda's highest honour, the Pearl of Africa Order First Class when he visited Kampala for Wednesday's Independance celebrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Uganda's Finance Minister has agreed that there were flaws in the implementation of Value Added Tax (VAT). A tax board to mediate between Uganda's Revenue Authority and taxpayers has been established following a week long strike by traders who demanded that the VAT (at 17%) introduced in July be reduced or scrapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Ugandan Cabinet approved a bill for a massive nationwide election of over 300,000 members of district and local councils. The council poll, which involves the filling of nine posts in each of the country's 29,000 villages, 4,251 parishes, 850 subcounties and municipalities, 169 counties and 39 districts, completes a process which started with presidential elections under a new constitution on 9 May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Low morale amongst Uganda's farmers has contributed to a country-wide shortage of staple crops and has sent prices soaring. In Kampala, beans are reported to have risen from US$0.3 per kilogram to US$0.7. A kilogram of maize has doubled from US$ 2 to US$ 4. Prices of both commodities are reported to be higher outside Kampala. The national secretary of the Uganda Commercial Farmers Association says that some farmers, demoralised by the impending sale of their properties, opted last season not to produce the country's two staples. The sale of the farms is part of a bid by the Government to recover government loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Tanzania is to receive a soft loan next year of US$ 100 million in balance of payment support from the World Bank. The decision, announced in Dar-es-Salaam last week, was taken at a Washington meeting which expressed satisfaction with Tanzania's economic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The UN's Consolidated Fund Raising Document for the Great Lakes has helped secure 60.9% of the funds required for 1996, according to data received from DHA's Financial Tracking System. A shortfall of $227 is still outstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Despite a generally improved crop and food supply situation in much of sub-Saharan Africa, thirteen African countries are suffering from continued food shortages and emergencies. A special report released by the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) on 10 October says that Burundi, Liberia and Somalia have been hardest hit. Despite a good overall cereal harvest, large numbers of people in Tanzania are reported to be in need of food aid following localised crop failures. The FAO report, which cites civil strife, displacement of rural population and economic sanctions as the main causes threatening food supplies in Burundi, says the situation in Burundi is likely to deteriorate further in coming months. The report comes just weeks in advance of the World Food Summit to be held at FAO headquarters in Rome from 13 to 17 November 1996.</SPAN></P>

The Regional Summit expressed its satisfaction with the implementation of the sanctions and commended the countries of the region and other implementing countries for the cooperation and cohesion shown in applying the sanctions to ensure the attainment of the intended objective. It also commended the support extended to the countries of the region by the international community and in particular the UN through its Resolution 1072 (1996) and the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The Summit reiterated that the objective of the sanctions is to serve as an effective means of securing a negotiated settlement between all the parties to the conflict in Burundi in an effort to avert a human disaster in the country. This should also remain a common objective of the international community as a whole and deserves its continued support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The Regional Summit also took note of the exemptions already granted in respect of fertilisers and vegetable seeds in recognition of the steps taken by the Buyoya regime towards meeting the conditions set by the Arusha II Summit. It also undertook to further respond positively should the regime enter into negotiations with all parties to the conflict in the context of the Arusha II Summit. It commended the work of the Regional Sanctions Co- ordinating Committee and directed the latter to ensure the speedy implementation of decisions already taken or to be taken with respect to exemptions on humanitarian grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The Summit emphasized that the central requirement of the Arusha II Summit was unconditional negotiations of all parties to the conflict and armed factions inside and outside the country. The Summit decided that these negotiations in the context of the Mwanza Peace Process should start within a period of one month from the date of this communique. The preparatory phase of these negotiations should commence immediately. The Summit further expressed its readiness to take appropriate measures against any group or faction that refuses to participate in the negotiations or places obstacles in the way of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The Summit reiterated that sanctions were not imposed for the benefit of, or to the detriment of any group or faction. The imposition of sanctions was intended, inter-alia, to exert the necessary pressure in order to achieve the political objective of a negotiated and peaceful solution to the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The Summit was briefed by the Facilitator on the contacts and efforts he has made towards promoting negotiations since Arusha II Summit. In this connection, the Summit was informed by the Facilitator that he has now received a written communication from Major Buyoya confirming the latter's commitment to enter into negotiations with CNDD and all other armed factions which are ready to negotiate. In view of this development, the Summit decided to send a Ministerial delegation to Bujumbura to follow up on this development, so as to enable the countries of the region to evaluate the situation and take appropriate action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The Regional Summit expressed its appreciation to President Mkapa, his Government and the people of Tanzania for hosting the Summit and extending the usual hospitality to the Heads and delegation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Gold production in Zimbabwe fell slightly in September compared with the same period in 1995, but total output in the first nine months of the year showed a slight increase of over 2 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official at the Chamber of Mines of Zimbabwe told said on Tuesday production in September reached 1,925.25 kg (4,245 pounds) worth 35.1 million U.S. dollars, compared with 2,161 kg (4,765 pounds) mined the same month in 1995, then worth 23.1 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the first nine months of 1996, 18.43 tons of gold worth 227 million dollars were produced, whereas in the corresponding period in 1995, 18.031 tons, then worth 188 million dollars were mined.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Output up to the end of August totalled 16.504 tons valued at 201 million dollars, which was up from the 15.87 tons mined in the same period in 1995, then valued at 160 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said production could have been affected by the &quot;fairly static&quot; gold price, which had not moved much in both United States and Zimbabwe dollar terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, gold, the country's second largest foreign currency earner after tobacco, brought 260 million dollars from exports, while output exceeded 24 tons for the first time in five decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's leading gold producers are Falcon Gold, Rio Tinto, Lonrho Zimbabwe, Anglo American Corporation and Ashanti Goldfields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe is Africa's third largest gold producer after South Africa and Ghana, and is ranked number 17 in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official also said it was too early to assess the success of a recent scheme introduced by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to pay large gold producers in foreign currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the official said production of other minerals in the first seven months of 1996 showed a slight increase, particularly nickel, copper, asbestos and ferro-chrome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These all seem to be doing reasonably well, like nickel considering that it had some price problems,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the mining industry, which in 1995 produced minerals worth over 500 million dollars, was trying to absorb recent increases in input costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major input items which went up in the last two months included wages and salaries, electricity and fuel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COTONOU, Benin (PANA) - Businessmen in Benin Republic are currently counting their losses over Nigeria's decision to lift the ban on the importation of rice, according to an investigation by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is such that 'La Nation', a daily newspaper in Benin, wrote in its current edition that importers in the country had a &quot;stock&quot; of over 35, 000 tons of unsold parboiled rice in their various warehouses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another 20,000 tons of the favorite Nigerian staple have also been cleared from the ships that brought the commodity into Benin.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the paper, &quot;if nothing is done to cushion the effects of the action taken by the Nigerian government, it will not only slow down imports to the country, but will equally cause the country to lose about 10 billion f cfa,&quot; (about 20 million U.S. dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report noted that the assertion that &quot;when the Nigerian economy is afflicted with catarrh, Republic of Benin will sneeze&quot; was correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is clear that the loss of about 5.4 billion f cfa earnings currently being realized by Beninese importers of the commodity, will not only bring about a loss to the country's shipping agents and the customs, but it will also affect the Republic of Togo,&quot; La Nation said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper said that because of the strategic position of Benin Republic, it had been realizing enormous profits from the re-exportation of rice to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to official figures, Benin has been importing over 200,000 tons of rice every year, 85 percent of which go to Nigeria, the remaining 15 percent represent the white rice consumed locally and exported to neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Benin customs realizes about 9 billion f cfa, while its ports authority gets about 547 million f cfa and the transit company, (Sobema) realizes 768 million f cfa from the transactions every year (500 f cfa = 1 USD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agents as well as transit organizations from the country smile to the banks with as much as 300 million and 390 million f cfa respectively per annum from the rice business with Nigeria, according to the statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">La Nation said that businessmen in Benin, who have been affected by the slur in the rice business, had urged their government to take some measures to save the business in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The businessmen are asking the government to reduce customs tariff from the present 21.18 percent to 9.08 percent, which will still leave the country with earning of about 5 billion f cfa yearly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informed sources said that the businessmen, who had already completed their customs formality forms, were urging the government to refund the Valued Added Tax they paid for the goods or convert it to duty for future imports.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">soon embark on a 240-million-dollar rehabilitation project to improve services at the Tema and Takoradi ports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to journalists on an industrial tour of Tema, Nestor Galley, acting director of Ports, said the rehabilitation will include the dredging of the Tema Port from the present depth of 9 meters to about 15 meters (10 to 16 yards).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rehabilitation is to enable bigger vessels to berth at the port in line with the government's GATEWAY policy which is to make the country the main entry into the West African market by foreign investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A free port and an export processing zone have been created in Tema to promote the GATEWAY programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Galley said a container terminal will be developed in Tema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Takoradi, two specialized dry bulk berths will be built to support the expected increase in the export of manganese and bauxite.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has met with diplomats to discuss the alarming rise in violent crime, particularly in Maputo, the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's press attache, Antonio Matonse, told Tuesday the state news agency, AIM, that Chissano had met Monday the visiting deputy general director of the Swiss Cooperation Office, Rudolf Dannecker, and diplomats from Switzerland, the United States, Holland, South Africa and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diplomatic community in Maputo was particularly outraged by the brutal murder 30 Sept. of Swiss anthropologist, Nicole Besenczon, killed by a gang of car thieves who made off with her Toyota four-wheel drive vehicle. The car was recovered by the police last week in the town of Matola, but the murderers have not yet been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matonse said Chissano and the diplomats met for more than two hours, and that the meeting was characterized by &quot;frankness, a frontal approach, and a desire to go forward in partnership to find solutions to the crime wave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, he added, &quot;made an exhaustive analysis of the crime situation, of the state of the Mozambican police, and of the support the international community can provide to train the police and enhance its skills.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">portraying Africa negatively, an African American writer charged Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, at a workshop in Harare for Zimbabwean and American writers, publishers and booksellers, Ishmael Reed said many western novelists still painted Africa as a jungle and dark continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reed said Africans were not winning international awards on their writings like the Nobel Prize for literature because of racists who blocked such moves, adding that he would make a personal effort to introduce work by African writers to the American readership. The United States Information Service cultural affairs officer, Paul Patin, conceded Americans were ignorant about real contemporary African literature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patin said it was hard to get literature by African writers in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the American publishers and writers attending the workshop had resolved to help their Zimbabwean counterparts penetrate the American market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zimbabweans still have a lot to learn about how to adequately market themselves in the states and I am happy the Americans have agreed to do that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he urged Zimbabweans to expose themselves to African American literature to learn more about problems faced by blacks in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-day workshop, dubbed Corridors of Culture - From the Muse to the Market Place, was organized by the U.S. information service. It aims to find ways of making the writing and publishing industry in Zimbabwe more viable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State-owned daily, The New Vision, reported Tuesday that the wives of two soldiers were killed in the attack at Pakele in Adjumani sub-district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They temporarily overran our detachment in the dawn attack. This morning we sent reinforcement of gun ships which sent them in disarray,&quot; confirmed Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, commander of the Uganda Peoples' Defence Forces (UPDF) operations in northern Uganda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson of the U.N. High Commissioner for refugees in Kampala also confirmed Tuesday the attack on the U.N. compound in Pakele.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, the place was attacked at around 5.45 a.m. (2.45 GMT), but no U.N.  staff was killed or injured. But a lot of property was destroyed and looted.  Most of the vehicles destroyed were hired by the U.N.,&quot; said the spokesman.  The rebels also grabbed the radios from the vehicles which they later set ablaze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR in Adjumani caters for an estimated 100,000 refugees from Sudan.  President Yoweri Museveni is expected to visit northern Uganda Tuesday, his second visit this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said the rebels crossed from neighboring Gulu district, the heart of the insurgency for the last 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the army has since occupied the area and are pursuing the rebels. &quot; They are desperately looking for a new base because the army is taking control of Acholi&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acholi is comprised of Gulu and Kitgum districts. For years, the rebels of Joseph Kony's LRA have operated in the two districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the rebels attacked St. Mary's College Aboke, in the neighboring district of Apac, and abducted about 150 girls. About 20 of the girls still remain in rebel captivity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUANDA, Angola (PANA) - United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Monday he was &quot;deeply shocked&quot; by the number of Angolans maimed by anti- personnel mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is urgent to get rid of all anti-personnel landmines in Angola,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments were made at the destruction of 54 tonnes of mines at the Angolan National Police Academy in Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher, who arrived in the country Monday, was told that between 150 and 200 Angolans died each week from landmine blasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States government, under President Bill Clinton, ironically opposed a recent international draft convention proposal to completely ban the production of landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher, however, said that the United States would continue to help Angola in clearing these mines and advocated for the end of their production worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the cold war between East and West, and which pitted the administration in Luanda against pro-West anti-government forces; the United States backed Unita while the Soviet Union, Cuba and many African states backed the Luanda government of President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the two decades of civil war and the war of independence against Portugal, hundreds of thousands of mines were laid across Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, the United States eventually established diplomatic relations with its erswhile enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without doubt, the Angolan tragedy has helped the world understand the dangers anti-personnel landmines hold for the world,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luanda - Remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at a demining site on October 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly two years ago, after decades of war and the loss of half a million lives, Angolans decided that enough was enough. The signing of the Lusaka Protocol in November, 1994, gave the people of Angola their best chance for peace in a generation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the largest current U.N. peacekeeping mission is deployed here in Angola. Under the leadership of Special Representative Beye, UNAVEM III has been a success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much has been accomplished. But with UNAVEM leaving in a matter of months, it is imperative that both sides move rapidly to meet their obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITA must fulfill its pledge to send its remaining Generals to Luanda, to provide 26,000 volunteers for the combined armed forces, and to assure the free movement of goods and peoples throughout the country. The government must recover weapons from civilians and ensure that the UNITA soldiers it integrates have real jobs, security, and respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political integration is also essential. I welcome the proposals UNITA has recently put forward on the government of national unity. I urge the government to ensure that UNITA has the resources and freedom it needs to make the transition from an armed movement to a political party. And I call on President Dos Santos and Dr. Savimbi to fulfill their commitment to meet in Luanda as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above all let me stress, as the Security Council made clear last Friday, that the international community expects full compliance with the peace accord. It will not tolerate any resumption of conflict. The United States is committed to a long-term partnership with Angola and we will pursue that partnership with all those who maintain their commitment to peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past year, the United States has provided $100 million for programs to reform Angola's economy, to demobilize soldiers, to build democratic institutions, and to help the innocent victims of the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unprecedented effort is also under way to clear Angola of landmines.  Today, there are more landmines in Angola than people. Between 150 and 200 Angolans are killed every week; millions more walk this country's roads and farm its lands in fear. With support from USAID, American organizations like the Vietnam Veterans of America, Save the Children, and CARE are helping Angolans rid themselves of this scourge. President Clinton is also committed to a global ban on anti-personnel mines. Angola's tragedy has helped awaken the world to the urgency of this goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angola's future can be bright. It has immense natural and human resources.  Angola should join the rest of southern Africa in moving toward democracy, peace, and prosperity. Angola's friends will stay engaged to help make that happen so long as Angola's leaders take the tough but necessary steps they have pledged to take.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - The long awaited report of the United Nations Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) review team was finally published last month. Any of our readers who may have already read the report could be forgiven for feeling that it is not worth the cost of undertaking the review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seasoned observers who have come to know the machinations of such international operations will not be surprised by the report and will have expected little better. Such reviews usually vindicate the organisation concerned and provide mitigation for each of its shortcomings or failures.  This report of the OLS review team has proved to be little different.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conclusion of the report is that, on balance, OLS has done a good job and should continue doing much the same thing. A short paragraph of page 263 states that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some fundamental criticisms of OLS have been made in the review. It should be stated at the outset, however, that the review team believes that the OLS should continue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whilst the entire review is punctuated with criticisms of the operation, these criticisms are also always justified by some mitigating evidence. An example of this is one page 220, where OLS and the UN are excused the responsibility for failing to protect the displaced people of Southern Sudan who live in subhuman conditions in Northern Sudan:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The analysis of OLS Northern Sector suggests that a major failure of international and UN policy has occurred, particularly with regard to the crisis of internal displacement. The fundamental issue of protection for the large, internally-displaced population within Sudan has remained unaddressed.  The origins of this failure are linked to a number of factors, including the lack of clarity with regard to the mandates of different UN agencies in applying the existing international instruments for the protection of war- displaced populations globally, and the poorly-developed contractual framework which guides UN operations in the Northern Sector. In effect, the UN is constrained by the sovereignty of the Government of Sudan from confronting disaster-producing policies which create vulnerability among those displaced by the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While in part reflecting managerial and organisational problems, the UN policy failure in the Northern Sector represents a more fundamental flaw in the conceptualisation of chronic political emergencies, and especially the contradiction of demanding that the UN ensure the neutrality of its operations in a context where a sovereign government is also a party to the conflict. In this regard, the policy failure on the Northern Sector does not just lie with the UN, but with the international community in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sovereignty is one of the areas in which the review fails to impress.  Members of the review team included people who know Sudan well enough to appreciate that Sudanese sovereignty is at best questionable and it was the contesting of this sovereignty in the South which led to OLS being created in the first place. Some members of the review team have risked their lives in Sudan in the recent past to deliver relief assistance to Southern Sudan in spite of Khartoum's claim to sovereignty over the region. To suggest that the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime be permitted to use sovereignty as a way f flouting agreement over relief assistance in the South, or amongst the displaced Southern Sudanese communities in Northern Sudan, would be to sentence the entire population to the whims of a regime whose policies towards the people are genocidal, to say the least.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sovereignty has not prevented the UN from operating in other parts of the world independently of the the government when a government has deliberately targeted a community for genocide or ethnic cleansing. Such communities have been afforded international protection from their own governments. Recent examples include Rwanda, Burundi, and Bosnia. If the the NIF regime is allowed to use the sovereignty card in Southern Sudan, it will make the work of the OLS that much more meaningless. Instead of recommending its continuation, the review team should have recommended that the OLS close down and give the regime in Khartoum its sovereign reign over the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many respects the review is too voluminous, giving too much information and detail which is not entirely relevant to the central issues which need addressing. Evidence has been presented in an unstructured and incoherent way, so that it is difficult to follow related items and subject matter. The net result of this layout is that the reader finds it more difficult to discern whether or not a comment is meant as a criticism of OLS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years the Gazette has been quite critical of the OLS over the way it has allowed the NIF regime to manipulate the original OLS mandate and turn it against the principles and the objectives for which it was established. In the belief that a comprehensive review might recognize this and work to return OLS to its original mandates, the Gazette welcomed the establishment of the review team. The terms of reference of the review team raised these issues:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To analyze the OLS mandate, its appropriateness in creating maximum access to populations in need and ensuring respect for fundamental humanitarian principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To assess the effectiveness of OLS' coordination structures, in particular the relationship between the UN, donors, NGO and Sudanese Counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To assess the efficiency of OLS' modus operandi, identifying constraints and achievements of OLS' various activities in:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the provision of appropriate, timely and cost-effective relief assistance to populations in need;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the provision of programmmes contributing to the promotion of self- sufficiency and food security;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the efficiency of OLS operational support to programme delivery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The review report ignores these main objectives for setting up the OLS review! Not a single voice of those who are affected by the war and whom the OLS is supposed to serve is heard in this report. In stead of providing a voice for the affected population, the review team legitimizes the patronizing attitude of relief agencies that think that once a person is hungry, he no longer knows what he wants, has no voice and should be fed what others decide they should be given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who, for instance, are the &quot;counterparts&quot; mentioned in the terms of reference for the review team? Are they the government in Khartoum and the SPLA? Was it too difficult for the review team to speak to some of the communities who had been served by the OLS over the years and to include a small passage in the words of these people themselves?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The review team has not really faced up to the criticisms of OLS made by the Gazette and others over the years. The answers provided are substantial and leave a lot to be desired. Then, again, the review was not intended to placate this publication but was designed to ensure the continued support for the OLS from the international donor community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - An outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever began a few weeks ago in the Makokou region, in the north-eastern part of the country. Fourteen cases have been detected so far, of which ten were fatal, two are recovering and two are acutely ill in hospital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Ministry of Health of Gabon, the first case occurred on 24 July in a hunter who probably became infected in the forest and died in a hospital in Boue, 200 km from Makokou, on 7 August. The last suspected case, which had no obvious link to other cases, died on 8 October. Sixty contacts have been identified of which 40 will require follow-up. Serological diagnosis with locally available reagents confirmed that an Ebola-like virus is responsible for the outbreak; further tests on blood and tissues samples are in process at the WHO Collaborating Centre at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Health quickly reinforced the local health facilities with medical and paramedical staff. A WHO team was requested 11 October and arrived on site the following day to assist in the investigation of the outbreak, follow-up of contacts and control activities. WHO has also provided logistic support for the teams. Control activities include epidemiological investigation, establishment of proper case diagnosis, review of cases and available data, and clinical management including the establishment of facilities for isolation of patients in two pre-defined sites in case of need.  Laboratory studies will continue aiming at the isolation of a virus and further serological evidence among case-contacts and convalescents. Health workers in dispensaries between Makokou (200 km east of Boue) and Mbomaho (100 km west of Boue) will be trained in active surveillance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Following is a statement by Dr Alex Boraine, vice chairperson of the Truth And Reconciliation Commission issued October 16, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is engaged in urgent discussions to allow warrants of arrest to be served on two of five former Security policemen who are applying for amnesty, while ensuring at the same time that the hearing of their amnesty application goes ahead next week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five applicants were given temporary protection yesterday pending a decision on whether they are eligible for the Commission's witness protection programme. Admission to the programme depends on the Commission's assessment of whether their security i s threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission is surprised at the decision of Attorney-General Dr Jan D'Oliveira to issue warrants of arrest a few days before the amnesty applicants are due to appear. However, we will not obstruct justice by interfering in the service of warrants of a r rest. At the same time, we are determined that the amnesty application next week should go ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After discussions with Dr D'Oliveira, we are confident that although two of the applicants may be charged in court this week, they will be available to the Amnesty Committee for next week's hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission respects the work with which the Attorneys-General are charged and we reiterate that we will not do anything to obstruct the course of justice. However, the Commission is an independent body and we also have a mandate given to us by Parliament which we are bound to implement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, we are determined to keep faith with those who have applied for amnesty and to ensure that they appear before the Amnesty Committee on October 21 as arranged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The observance of the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty must be the occasion for a renewed, world-wide commitment to stem the rising tide of world poverty. There is no greater challenge to the international community today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1 billion people around the world are still living in absolute poverty. In too many parts of the developing world, people face a daily struggle to overcome the burdens of hunger and disease, often in conditions of civil strife and war. Women and children are the most affected. In fact, no society, even in the industrialized world, can claim to be free of the problem of poverty. In a world of expanding wealth and prosperity, inequalities and the risks of marginalization of certain countries, and of groups within countries, are also on the rise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has made the assault on poverty a priority. The urgent need for new policies and new initiatives, and for the active involvement of local, community-based organizations and civil society at large, has dominated all United Nations world conferences on development issues held over the last five years: the World Summit on Children, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the International Conference on Population and Development, the World Summit for Social Development, the Fourth World Conference on Women and the Second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the 1995 World Summit for Social Development, 117 heads of State agreed to an integrated approach to poverty eradication based on the concept of partnership, within societies as well as between developed and developing countries. The Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action embodies commitments and measures at both the national and international level to stimulate growth, trade and employment; to improve health, community and education systems; and to ensure that official development assistance goes where it is needed most -- on meeting basic human needs in the world's poorest countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere are these needs greater than in the continent of Africa. Earlier this year, I launched the United Nations System-Wide Special Initiative on Africa, to support and expedite the realization of the goals established by the General Assembly in the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. This Initiative, developed in close consultation with Africa's leaders, underlines the United Nations commitment to promoting development and security throughout the world's poorest continent. It emphasizes the importance of self-reliance and economic reform. It mobilizes resources to meet desperate needs in health, education and employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we are to succeed in combating poverty, new policies will be needed at all levels. At the global level, a concerted effort is required to create a conducive international environment, geared to supporting the integration of the least developed countries, and of the poorest groups within countries, in the mainstream of the global economy. At the national level, policies to enhance overall competitiveness must be accompanied by targeted programmes and projects that combat social exclusion, expand social services and stimulate productive employment. At all levels, there is a pressing need to recognize that the poor can be key partners in the development process, and that investments in people are the surest way to lasting development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this day -- and as 1996, which was proclaimed by the General Assembly International Year for the Eradication of Poverty, comes to an close -- we must renew our efforts to ensure that the commitments made in international forums are translated into concrete advances for the world's poor, and that all people are given an opportunity to contribute to, and share in, economic growth and sustainable development. If we do so, we can begin at last to eradicate the world-wide scourge of poverty.</SPAN></P>

The visit will continue through 21 October.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Special Rapporteur, Rene Degni-Segui of Cote d'Ivoire, is charged with examining the situation in Rwanda and reporting on the causes of the serious violations of human rights that occurred there and on those responsible for the atrocities committed during the 1994 genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Degni-Segui, who receives regular updates from the United Nations human- rights operation in Rwanda, will use the trip to review the situation with human-rights observers and with local and national authorities. He also will meet with representatives of civil society, with officials of UN Agencies operating in Rwanda, and with human-rights activists, and will visit regional offices of the human-rights operation. Following the mission, he will travel to Belgium, where he will meet from 22 to 24 October with various groups concerned with Rwandan human-rights issues. He will return to Cote d'Ivoire on 25 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following these activities, the Special Rapporteur will prepare a report for submission to the Social Commission of the General Assembly, now in session in New York. The report will update Mr. Degni-Segui's previous assessment of the Rwandan situation submitted on 29 January 1996 to the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/1996/68) and to the current session of the General Assembly. The update will focus on the genocide, the recent evolution of the human-rights situation in Rwanda, and on the return of refugees, and will include the Special Rapporteur's recommendations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - While the Gambian people's commitment to the democratic process is shown by their 80% turnout at the recent presidential elections, The Carter Center notes that the manner in which the elections were held raises serious questions about the fairness of the electoral process and the legitimacy of Yahya Jammeh's victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the weeks leading up to the election, the military regime banned the country's main opposition parties, muzzled the press, forbade meetings between rival candidates and foreign diplomats, and used soldiers to attack opposition rallies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many serious election-day irregularities also were reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Carter Center is concerned that without a much-improved political process, the forthcoming Parliamentary elections will not be free or fair and that lasting damage will be done to Gambia's democratic tradition. The Center calls on President Jammeh to take all steps necessary to ensure a level playing field for future elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - The fight to stop poverty, which afflicts some 1.3 billion people worldwide, has united mayors from cities across the USA and Canada.  They are seeking to draw widespread public attention to the harsh effects of social deprivation and to help rally both local and international support against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobilized by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the association Sister Cities International, mayors from 40 cities in North America have signed proclamations declaring 17 October Poverty Eradication Day in their municipalities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cities joining the drive against poverty include: Akron, Ohio; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Arlington and Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Cleveland, Ohio; Colombus, Georgia; Denver, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Durham, North Carolina; Edmonton, Alberta (Canada); Escondido, California; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Honolulu, Hawaii; Jersey City, New Jersey; Kansas City, Missouri; Lincoln, Nebraska; Louisville, Kentucky; Miami, Florida; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Nashville, Tennessee; New Haven, Connecticut; New York, New York; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Omaha, Nebraska; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; San Francisco, San Jose and Santa Clarita, California; St. Paul, Minnesota; Spokane, Washington; Stockton, California; Syracuse, New York; Tampa, Florida; Tempe, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; Tulsa, Oklahoma and Washington, DC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Poverty does not only affect women and children living in developing countries; poor (people) live in cities in the most industrialized countries, including Philadelphia and many other cities here in the United States,&quot; said Edward G. Rendell, Mayor of Philadelphia. &quot;To become a truly great global community, we must re-emphasize our commitment to efforts to eradicate poverty and its devastating impact on human well-being.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proclamation signed by Mayor Rendell and others reads in part: &quot;This occasion is an opportunity for us to rededicate ourselves to make the fight against poverty an absolute priority, focusing on the needs of the poor and upon measures that are being undertaken with the collaboration of the city government and its partners to eradicate poverty....&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In industrialized countries, including the US, more than 100 million people live in poverty and five million are homeless, according to the Human Development Report 1996, published by Oxford University Press for UNDP. And, while the US enjoys steady economic and job growth, the number of people living below the poverty line is actually growing. That is why the report states that poverty eradication efforts should not be limited to poor countries. Poverty extends beyond national borders, just as it extends beyond the confines of the inner city, the report states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the urgency of the poverty challenge, the United Nations General Assembly designated 17 October the &quot;International Day for the Eradication of Poverty&quot; and 1996 the &quot;International Year for the Eradication of Poverty&quot;. The mobilization of North American mayors is one of a series of public awareness activities planned by UNDP for the week of 17 October through 24 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other activities planned include: a UNDP-United Nations Association contest aimed at encouraging school children across the US to take up poverty eradication projects in their own communities; and, in what is billed as a decisive gesture of solidarity for the world's poor, UNDP has invited staff of all UN agencies to fast on 18 October and to donate $5 each to development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless we address the problems of poverty now, none of the great goals the international community has set -- peace, stability, human rights for all, preservation of the environment -- are achievable in a world where half of the people find themselves shut out of opportunity and the benefits of a global society,&quot; said UNDP Administrator James Gustave Speth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - Following is a message from James Gustave Speth administrator, United Nations Development Programme, on the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, 17 October 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today marks the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. On this day, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) re-dedicates itself to a decade-long, global effort to replace hunger, helplessness and despair with opportunity, hope and the promise of a better future. Poverty places an intolerable burden on the human spirit. We cannot accept that it will always be with us. The modern world has the resources, the know-how and the expertise to relegate poverty to the pages of history.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why UNDP, with the enthusiastic backing of our Executive Board, has made the fight against world poverty its central and overriding priority.  UNDP now spends nearly 90 per cent of its core resources in countries with 90 per cent of the world's poorest people. We have committed the full force of all our energies to the gravest human challenge of our time -- an effort which will also galvanize and energize the various efforts of the United Nations around a great and just cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Picture a moment what being poor really means -- beyond the vast numbers of nameless, faceless people who many think live only in faraway places. Poverty is a hungry and thirsty child who cannot understand why there is no food and no water. Poverty is an elderly woman with no heat in winter, a woman with a lifetime of hard work behind her and only a damp chill as her reward. Poverty is a fisherman whose waters -- and livelihood -- have been spoiled by pollution through no fault of his own. But being poor is more than a lack of food, shelter and livelihoods. Poverty means marginalization -- the exclusion of millions of people in countries, rich and poor, from the benefits of progress. Poverty also means polarization -- the growing gap between the haves and the have-nots, both between countries and within countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inequities breed joblessness and hopelessness, anger and despair -- and all too often violence and conflict. The world must make a place for everyone to share in its bounty. And the poor need more control over the forces shaping their lives. They need the opportunity to lift themselves out of poverty and social exclusion and enter a world of equity and justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The income gap between the richest and poorest 20 per cent of the world's people has not been narrowing in the past 30 years. It has, in fact, doubled.  Each day, 68,000 people join the ranks of the poor -- families living on less than one dollar a day. Let us ask ourselves what the future could possibly hold for the children in these families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal to eradicate extreme poverty is not some lofty idealism when we see how many industrial countries over the course of this century have done just that. In this sense, conquering poverty is not just a moral imperative but a feasible objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the spirit of the 1995 Copenhagen World Summit on Social Development as our guide and inspiration, UNDP is helping to forge a world partnership geared to replacing poverty with equity. We have set our goals to provide sustainable livelihoods, to advance the well-being of women and to regenerate the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNDP offices throughout the world are sponsoring and organizing events to observe the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. The activities, which take place during the week of 17-24 October, are designed to encourage and assist governments and their people to develop national poverty eradication strategies as well as plans of actions which are comprehensive, participatory and realistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within this framework, UNDP is working with governments to help them identify the nature and scope of poverty in their respective countries. We are supporting initiatives that provide equitable access to assets including skills, credit, jobs and sustainable livelihoods, land and environmental resources, linkages to national and international markets and information systems, citizenship rights and legal rights for women and minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real potential of the next century will not be found in stocks or technology or minerals. The real potential of the future will be found in the three billion people now living in poverty who collectively represent the greatest potential for growth and opportunity the world has ever seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless we address the problems of poverty now, none of the great goals the international community has set -- peace, stability, human rights for all, preservation of the environment -- are achievable in a world where one half of the people find themselves shut out of opportunity and the benefits of a global society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poverty is the great denier. It denies comfort, dignity, freedom, participation.  Today we deny the great denier its handiwork. I call upon every individual who cares about justice and human dignity to join the global campaign to eradicate poverty. We have the know-how. We have the resources.  Today, we need the commitment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - A comment about U.S. Africa policy last week by a senior French official has produced an unusually sharp public exchange between Washington and Paris, with Secretary of State Warren Christopher leading the American charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on Christopher's five-nation Africa tour, French Minister for Foreign Cooperation Jacques Godfrain reportedly said: &quot;Since Bill Clinton hasn't been to Africa once, since he didn't even mention Africa in his speech before the UN General Assembly, and since U.S. foreign development aid has diminished by 15 per cent, I am delighted to see the president showing interest in Africa and making it a priority three weeks before the presidential election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher fired back during an October 12 appearance in Johannesburg, accusing France of trying to monopolize relations with its former African colonies. &quot;The time has passed when Africa could be carved into spheres of influence, or when outside powers could view whole groups of states as their private domain,&quot; the secretary said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns took up the refrain when asked about the flap at the October 15 department briefing. &quot;It just shows that not everybody in Paris has a good understanding of how the American political system works, much less American diplomacy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A string of U.S. officials from Vice President Al Gore to National Security Adviser Tony Lake to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbot have visited Africa, Burns said, adding: &quot;If Monsieur Godfrain had done his homework, he would have seen that the United States under the Clinton Administration has taken a more active role.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is true that some people in Paris seem to live under the delusion that certain parts of Africa can be the preserve or the domain of a certain colonial power, -- ex-colonial power, by the way,&quot; Burns said. &quot;That is a far- fetched notion indeed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher observed on his trip, Burns said, that &quot;all of us need to be engaged to help the Africans fight the problems that that continent faces.&quot; Burns added: &quot;Certainly, the French Government and Monsieur Godfrain are not trying to suggest that France alone can save Africa -- that French officials alone can take trips to Africa without being accused of politicking -- of politics. This is a ludicrous charge made by someone who's not paid attention to what the United States has done. It ought to be retracted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a humorous exchange with reporters, in which Burns quipped that Christopher poured French wine &quot;down the drain on the plane,&quot; he concluded by saying: &quot;We want to work with the French. We don't want to have to work across purposes. ... We want to have a relationship where we have no surprises in public -- where, if we have differences, we have them in private -- and where we respect each other in public as well as in private.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - A late September cartoon in the Cincinnati Inquirer showed Ross Perot stamping on his Western hat in anger at being excluded from the Presidential debates. A plaintive globe-headed figure labelled &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; looked on, empathetically remarking &quot;I know how you feel ... I can't get in either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa, rarely edging onto the priority agenda of top foreign-policy makers, will find it even harder to make it onto the campaign trail. While marginalization of African concerns may be less dramatic in some European countries, the trend is not limited to the United States. Much of the Western world's policy establishment would prefer to forget the continent exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like it or not, however, policymakers in office in the coming years will have to decide how to respond to African crises and structural concerns. The issues may be neglected, but they will not go away.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now widely acknowledged that the primary initiative for redressing Africa's marginalization must come from Africa -- from civil society as well as more responsive governments and regional institutions, from those living on the continent as well as those who have settled elsewhere for political or economic reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a recent statement by African non- governmental organizations put it, &quot; The international community lacks the moral and political will to constructively assist Africa with its dilemmas.&quot; The statement went on to conclude that &quot;strong, accountable and responsible African institutions&quot; must take the lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On issue after issue, nevertheless, the &quot;international community&quot; is inextricably involved, whether in calls for United Nations support for peacekeeping, for reform of the international financial institutions which play a dominant role in the economy of most African countries, or in deciding on bilateral relations with repressive regimes opposed by pro- democracy forces. The US in turn, by default or by active engagement, has much to do with the &quot;moral and political will&quot; as well as the policy content of the international response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This text below consists of a summary checklist of many of the African issues which the next administration and the next Congress need to consider.  Some -- perhaps most -- may only be the subject of inside-the-beltway debate by a handful of policy advocates and middle-level officials. Some may also force themselves on the agenda for serious attention by major policy players.  That depends, in part, on CNN, The New York Times, and the media pack. But, even more, it depends on whether Africa's advocates here can make loud enough and coherent enough noises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please use one or more of these questions, adapt them, or substitute your own. Raise them at campaign events and/or mail them to candidates' campaign headquarters in your congressional district. Include candidates for the House of Representatives and the Senate as well as for President. Concentrate on one or two related questions in any one message, and ask for a specific reply, not just a form letter. You may wish to include other background material, but keep it short. You may or may not get an answer, but you will let the candidates know that voters do care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security, Conflict Resolution and Humanitarian Assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa&quot; is still widely perceived as a country, and not accurately understood as a highly diverse continent three times the size of the US containing more than fifty distinct countries.  Most of the continent's countries are now at peace, whatever other problems they face. Having experienced among the most destructive conflicts of the 1970s and 1980s, countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Uganda are all dealing with &quot;post- conflict&quot; rather than &quot; conflict&quot; issues. Others, such as Tanzania, Kenya, Botswana, Cameroon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Benin, and Tunisia, to name only a few from around the continent, have avoided post-colonial internal war, despite smaller-scale conflict and the cross-border impact of refugee flows from their neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, full-scale conflict in too many countries and the absence of minimal security for citizens in many others endangers not only the continent's image but its future. Neither democracy nor development can advance if citizens are at the mercy of unrestrained gunmen. A newly emerging consensus, contrary to the Organization of African Unity's general assumption since the 1960s, maintains that internal conflicts are not just the concern of one country. Neighboring countries and indeed the continent at large are victimized by spillover effects. Genocidal violence is in theory -- if not yet in practice -- the concern of the entire human community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the &quot;international community&quot; (both Africa-wide and world- wide) often lacks the capacity and the political will to respond. When governments and humanitarian NGOs do mobilize in response to a crisis, lines of accountability are often vague or ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One fundamental question is who takes responsibility to respond, and where the buck stops. In a crisis, neighboring countries are often the most intensely engaged. This can be an advantage but also a handicap in resolving conflicts. African regional and continental institutions have been taking a more active role in many crises, a trend which should be encouraged. But the scale of the military, organizational, and logistical resources needed means that the global community as well must take a hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few doubt that the United Nations and other agencies need to improve their efficiency, management capacity, and accountability. But unjustified and indiscriminate UN-bashing has become commonplace in US politics. The far- right attacks the institution as such. The Clinton administration has also used the institution as a scapegoat. &quot;Reform&quot; proposals have too often been designed simply to cut costs rather than to increase the UN s capacity to respond effectively to crises, such as the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and current threats of escalated genocidal violence in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls show that the general public takes a far more positive stance towards the United Nations than is reflected in the public political debate and the standard assumptions of policymakers. Indeed, some polls show that the UN is more widely trusted by US citizens to do the right thing than is the US Congress. A June, 1996 poll showed solid majorities willing to commit US troops to peacekeeping in Burundi, as long as other countries did their share.  But such alternatives are excluded from the menu of options policymakers will take seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, the largest UN peacekeeping contingent on the continent is in Angola, where the peace agreement signed in late 1994 is threatened by repeated delays. Angola faces a grave risk of a resurgence of war or an indefinite continuation of the current deadlock with two separate armies and little security for civilians. In Liberia, regional West Africa peacekeepers are the key force on the ground, but the chances of implementing the latest agreement depend on greater support from outside the region. The volatile Great Lakes region is still coping with the aftermath of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and escalating ethnic violence both in Burundi and in neighboring eastern Zaire. While intense peace efforts are currently under way, everyone involved warns that their chances of success are very unpredictable, and the weekly death toll could easily rise from hundreds to thousands or tens of thousands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No peacekeeping operations are currently envisaged for war- torn Sudan or for Somalia, still without a national government. Among the critical issues are not only the international community s continued involvement in humanitarian relief, but also what actions can be taken to promote peace and respect for human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions: (1) Do you support full payment of US dues to the United Nations? Full US funding of its obligations for United Nations peacekeeping?  If not, why not?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) What level of financial and logistical assistance do you advocate for peacekeeping mechanisms and operations by the Organization of African Unity and African regional organizations? Increase? Decrease? About the same? Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) How do you propose to help strengthen the voices of African civil society to participate in international debates about the future of peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance and in monitoring the record of &quot; donor&quot; governments, international agencies, and non-governmental organizations?  (4) Angola: Should the UN peacekeeping operation in Angola be continued beyond February 1997, if full implementation of the 1994 Lusaka peace agreement is further delayed? If UNITA continues to refuse to implement the agreement's provisions on military and political integration into one national army and a government of national unity, what additional sanctions, by the US and the international community, do you support?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) Liberia: What level of involvement and assistance from the US in the peace process in Liberia do you support? Increase? Decrease? About the same?  Why? Do you support H.R. 4001, which proposes sanctions on countries violating the arms embargo against Liberian factions and investigation of war crimes by faction leaders?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) Great Lakes (Burundi and Rwanda): What level of US involvement and assistance in possible international peacekeeping in Burundi would you support? Funds? Logistic support? Contributing troops to UN peacekeeping?  What can the US do to help impose effective embargoes against arms flows that fuel the conflicts in the region? In particular, what actions would you support against the Mobutu regime in Zaire? How would you propose to increase US support for the International Tribunal on the Genocide in Rwanda?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(7) Horn of Africa (Sudan and Somalia): What additional sanctions against the military regime in Sudan, or new diplomatic initiatives, do you propose to increase the chances for peace negotiations in Sudan's civil war, as well as advancement of democracy and human rights for all Sudanese? In the absence of a national Somali government, what measures do you propose to provide protection for humanitarian agencies and human rights advocates, both foreign and Somali, in that territory?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratization &amp; Human Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support for democratization and human rights in Africa is in principle one of the cornerstones of US policy in Africa. Public pressure against abusive regimes, support for elections, aid to a wide variety of groups in African civil society -- all are on the standard list of policy instruments. Despite the relative consensus on this general policy framework, however, there are substantive concerns about US policy in practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Probably the most predictable as well as the most disturbing issue is the pervasive inertial tendency towards business as usual. Human rights are almost always given lip service, but far too often in practice are shoved to the side in favor of more &quot;realistic&quot; preoccupations with economic ties or other pragmatic considerations, including conflict resolution. High-profile criticism and, at the extreme, sanctions, are not appropriate in all cases, of course. However, in many cases the US response has been far too weak. With respect to Nigeria, Kenya, Zaire, Ethiopia, and many other cases, the response to repression, human rights abuses, or political exclusion of opponents has typically been to speak softly and carry a small stick, or none at all. The US has been more consistently willing to exert meaningful pressure to gain concessions on economic issues than to use effective leverage in support of the cause of human rights and democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the extent that the US has become engaged, through USAID and other bilateral agencies, in support of civil society and pro-democracy forces, there remain substantive issues of both quantity and quality. With strong Congressional pressure to cut back on funds available for almost all international involvement, many promising initiatives -- including US support for multilateral initiatives -- are ruled out for budgetary reasons.  To give only one set of examples, programs for international human rights monitors in conflict situations, as well as the international genocide tribunal, have been crippled by lack of timely funding and personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also the issue of the content of support that is given. Critics maintain that in many cases US programs inappropriately promote the uncritical transfer of US views to other societies, neglect the substance of democratic participation in favor of formalities of electoral systems and ill- defined &quot;training&quot; programs, and neglect the potential for dialogue with Africans themselves about priorities in building democratic institutions suitable for each country.  At a time when the World Bank and other multilateral institutions are increasingly realizing the need to listen to grassroots critics, the US still gives little opportunity for the intended beneficiaries to engage in dialogue with policymakers on the results and process of bilateral programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions: (1) Support for democracy and human rights: What level of US funding do you support for civil society, pro-democracy, and human-rights groups in Africa, through US agencies? Through multilateral institutions?  Through African governments that demonstrate the political will to build more effective and participatory democratic institutions? About the same as now, less than now, much less than now, more than now, much more than now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) Program accountability: What mechanisms do you propose or support to gain feedback from African human rights and pro- democracy representatives, and African civil society more generally, on US policy and programs concerning human rights and democracy in African countries?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) Nigeria: What additional measures, including specific sanctions, do you propose to increase pressure on the Nigerian military regime to respect human rights and accept popularly elected democratic authority? Do you support the Nigerian sanctions legislation introduced in 1996 by Senator Kassebaum (R-KS) and Representative Payne (D-NJ)? Would you support additional US funds to aid pro-democracy groups and Nigerian civil society?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) Kenya: Do you support withholding US and international aid from Kenya in response to the Moi regime's abuses of human rights, instigation of ethnic violence and harassment of political opposition groups?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) Zaire: What concrete measures would you support to induce pressure on Zaire leader Mobutu on issues including ethnic violence in Eastern Zaire, the flow of arms through Zaire fueling conflicts in Angola and the Great Lakes region, and repeated failure to stop impeding the process of democratization for Zaire?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) Algeria: Given the economic importance of US-Algerian ties, and the region-wide implications of the violent confrontation between a repressive regime and extremist fundamentalist forces, do you support a more active role for the US, with European and other countries, in promoting peace negotiations and an end to violence in Algeria?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sustainable Development &amp; Social Equity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of what policies are most effective in promoting sustainable development that can benefit the majority of Africa's people is complex.  There are no magic formulas to ensure success. US policy should integrate different components rather than placing sustainable development and private sector approaches as contradictory alternatives. Sustainable development should be the goal, including economic growth, social equity, and preservation of environmental capital which protects the options of future generations. These are goals and values which apply equally to the least developed countries and the most advanced industrial countries. As Africa advances towards these goals, the potential for mutually beneficial ties between the US and Africa also grows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade and aid policies should be seen as complementary, rather than mutually exclusive options applied to different sets of countries. The effectiveness of both will also be significantly affected by the adequacy of measures to address the serious problem of indebtedness of African states.  Both existing and new programs should be considered in relationship to each other, and evaluated in terms of their potential contribution to sustainable and equitable development. There should be procedures for results-based evaluation of programs, regardless of whether they are implemented primarily through governmental agencies, the private sector, or the voluntary sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actual economic ties between the United States and each of Africa's five regions (North, West, Central, East and Southern) are already substantial. Sub-Saharan Africa alone, excluding both North Africa and South Africa, accounts for more US trade than Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union combined. The potential for expansion is enormous. To develop that potential and insure that it benefits ordinary citizens both in Africa and the United States, however, requires sustained investment in human resources and infrastructure, understanding that the payoffs will take time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the end of political apartheid and the beginning of democracy in South Africa, the US and South Africa now confront many of the same dilemmas. Both need to deal with racially and class-divided societies, as well as with escalating crime and economic insecurity. Both must find how to invest in human resources and promote social equity while confronting serious budgetary constraints.  There is much opportunity for mutually beneficial exchange, not only in trade and investment, but also in dialogue about how to confront similar societal problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Do you support reinstatement of the &quot;earmarked&quot; allocation of assistance funds for the Development Fund for Africa, which ensures a minimum level of US bilateral support for African development?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) The US is dead last among developed countries in percentage of Gross National Product going to investment in sustainable development assistance world-wide, which accounts for less than 1% of the US federal budget. Yet the average American thinks we are spending 15 times that much or more. What are you doing as a candidate to correct this misinformation, and to promote increases in assistance that facilitates development?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) Do you support prompt US payment of outstanding arrears and current obligations to the World Bank's International Development Association, as well as to United Nations agencies engaged in development-oriented programs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) Program accountability: What mechanisms do you propose or support to gain feedback from African grassroots development groups, and from African civil society generally, on US policy and programs concerning economic policy and development in African countries?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) The &quot;structural adjustment&quot; packages promoted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and the parallel &quot;market-oriented economic reform&quot; packages pushed by the US government, have been strongly criticized by African grassroots groups as often overly rigid, damaging to the poor, harmful to the environment, and having a doubtful record even in terms of economic growth. What mechanisms would you suggest to promote a wider, more democratic debate about the proper mix of economic policies, both in international institutions and the US policy community, which would allow substantive input from African civil society, including environmental, labor, human rights, and women's groups?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) What measures do you support for more rapid debt relief for heavily indebted African countries, including better terms for relief of bilateral loans and of debts to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(7) Do you support measures such as the one advanced by Representative McDermott (D-WA) and others to expand US trade and investment with Africa, and to move towards a US-Africa Free Trade framework? If so, what measures do you propose to include so that the benefits are equitably distributed, with increased African access to the US market as well as vice- versa, and so that workers' and environmental rights are protected both in the US and Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(8) South Africa: What measures do you support to increase the dialogue between the United States and South Africa, at different levels of government and civil society, about common problems? What mechanisms do you support for both the South African and US public to provide more input on the content of US government programs in South Africa and US-South African dialogue at elite levels of government and business?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaping and Changing Gender Relations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highlighted by the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in September 1995, there is an increasing recognition that the solution of the full range of Africa's problems cited above will hinge in large part on the extent to which Africa's women move towards full participation at all levels. Women and children are disproportionately the victims of war and displacement. The voices of women, if they are heeded, are often the most eloquent and coherent for peacemaking. Support for the small farmer and rural food security, as well as for micro-enterprise and viable survival strategies in Africa's sprawling cities, in practice must mean support for women, who are disproportionately represented in these life- sustaining roles. Concerns for equity, human rights promotion and political participation must integrally support the protection of women's rights, including protection against domestic and sexual violence. New World Bank President James Wolfensohn has joined many earlier advocates in noting that investment in the education of girls is among the most cost- effective development action that countries and international institutions can take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African women's groups are both growing in number and taking a wider range of initiatives. But they face many difficulties, including lack of organizational capacity, traditional prejudices, and unsupportive governments.  Many of the initiatives promoting women's rights have been advanced by multilateral institutions, particularly UN specialized agencies, which face massive budget problems, largely as a result of US cutbacks. US government support for bilateral and multilateral family planning programs, vital to women's health, has been restricted by Congress. There is a continuing need to incorporate sensitivity to women's rights not only in economic or civil society assistance programs but also into human rights criteria which should influence US bilateral relations with African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Do you support continued and increased funding for multilateral and bilateral programs promoting African women's rights, including protection against violence, health, family planning, education, participation in economic development (including micro-enterprise), and political participation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) What measures do you support further to incorporate women's rights issues, including implementation of the Beijing Platform of Action, into US bilateral relations with African countries? Into immigration policy towards asylum seekers?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - The Burundian government reacted angrily to the October 12 decision by neighboring countries to maintain economic sanctions against Burundi. Despite the Buyoya regime's hopes that recent measures to reinstate parliament and allow the functioning of political parties would lead to a relaxing of the sanctions, heads of state from regional countries meeting in Arusha refused to grant additional concessions. In a statement two days later, the Burundian government said that talks with Hutu rebels would not take place until sanctions imposed by countries in the region were lifted. Both the Buyoya government and Leonard Nyangoma, head of the Hutu rebel CNDD movement, had earlier provided participants in the Summit written assurances that they were ready to negotiate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Tutsi hardliners continued to criticize the Buyoya regime's professed readiness to negotiate with those who support a &quot;genocidal ideology&quot; while receiving nothing in return from the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Requests by humanitarian agencies for exemptions for the importation of food and emergency relief items, such as blankets and plastic sheeting, were denied by the Arusha summit. However, recent outbreaks of fighting in both southern and northern Burundi, and the possible influx of thousands of refugees fleeing the fighting in eastern Zaire, makes the need for the items especially acute.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. General</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*In the days leading up to Arusha summit, Burundian officials warned that continued sanctions could spark further bloodshed in Burundi. Prime Minister Pascal-Fermin Ndimira told reporters that the embargo had so far cost his country $162 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of regional countries meeting in Arusha Oct. 12 to review the economic sanctions imposed on Burundi reiterated that the sanctions would remain in place until there was evidence of unconditional negotiations between all parties to the conflict in the country. In a communique issued by the presidents of Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Rwanda and the prime ministers of Ethiopia and Zaire, participants noted that exemptions had already been granted for the import of seeds and fertilizer and held out the carrot of further exemptions should the Buyoya regime begin negotiations. The participants agreed to send a ministerial level delegation to Bujumbura to evaluate Buyoya's commitment to enter into negotiations with the CNDD and &quot;to evaluate the situation and take appropriate action.&quot; The delegation was expected to arrive October 15, but only one member arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arusha communique stated that these negotiations should start by November 12, adding that participants had &quot;expressed readiness to take appropriate action against any group or faction that refuses to participate in the negotiations or places obstacles in the way of the peace process.&quot; It is still unclear what those actions might include, although an intervention force has been discussed as one possibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burundian government lashed out at those countries backing the sanctions and said that the maintenance of sanctions favored Hutu rebels and encouraged them to continue their campaign of killing civilians. In a national radio broadcast, a government spokesman called the decision one that &quot;gravely compromises the chances of peace and reconciliation.&quot; He added that &quot; in some quarters the objectives are different from those publicly expressed and amount to a secret agenda.&quot; In an October 15 press conference, the government withdrew former statements that it was willing to begin negotiations and said that now no negotiations would begin until sanctions are lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*US Secretary of State Warren Christopher told a press conference in Arusha Oct. 11 that a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Burundi &quot;is attainable&quot; but he added that should the situation in Burundi deteriorate further, &quot;the international community must be prepared to act quickly to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.&quot; The US has been promoting the creation of a US- backed African peace keeping force that could intervene in civil conflicts where mass killings of civilians appear likely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Ceremonies marking the 35th anniversary of the assassination of Prince Louis Rwagasore were conducted peacefully October 13. However, appeals from the mayor of Bujumbura for the events to be apolitical were ignored by Uprona supporters, who attended ceremonies wearing red and white caps and t-shirts, their party's colors. Prince Rwagasore, a founder of Uprona, was assassinated in 1961 shortly after being appointed prime minister. Although the crowd applauded warmly when Buyoya laid a wreath at Rwagasore's tomb, Leonce Ngendakumana, the speaker of the national assembly and most senior member of Frodebu present, was booed when he stepped up with a crown of flowers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*As violent clashes between the Zairian army, local tribes and the Banyamulenge continue, fears are mounting that the violence could have a severe impact on Burundi. Some 20,000 Hutu refugees from Burundi fled their camp in eastern Zaire on Sunday after it was attacked by armed men believed to be Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack on Runingo camp was the first of its kind in growing conflict in eastern Zaire. Runingo, close to the Burundian border, is one of several camps in the region that are home to 230,000 Hutu refugees. Most of the refugees are from Burundi, but some are also from Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the week, following the attack on a major hospital, allegedly by the Banyamulenge, Zaire declared a state of war in South Kivu and the vice governor of the region declared that the Banyamulenge had until October 15 to leave the region. That order was later revoked by the central government but officials in Kinshasa have made it clear that they want the approximately 200, 000 Banyamulenge in eastern Zaire to leave, raising fears of a possible large scale refugee flow into Rwanda and Burundi. Zaire has accused Burundi of backing the Banyamulenge, a charge the Burundian government denies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling for a military observer force to be dispatched to the region, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights (for Zaire) warned that the consequences of continued violence could be far greater than the current crisis in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fierce fighting was underway between military forces and Hutu rebels over the weekend of Oct. 12-13 in the southwestern province of Bururi. Although the number of casualties is still unclear, preliminary reports from aid agencies indicate that some 35,000 people have been displaced in towns around Rumenge. Those sites containing the affected people are: Muyange, Murage, Buyengero, Busaga, Kibizi and Muramvya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This most recent wave of fighting was sparked after 23 people were killed in the village of Burambi, 100 kilometers south of Bujumbura. The attack, allegedly by Hutu rebels, was one of the worst since the July coup. Soldiers reportedly set fire to the homes of local Hutu families accused of collaborating with the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explosions were heard around Bujumbura throughout the week, although it was difficult to ascertain if it was from fighting in Uvira or in the hills near the city. On October 14, soldiers were exchanging fire with Hutu rebels on the hills overlooking the capital. Soldiers were said to be shelling houses where rebels were allegedly hiding. Some 2,000 people living in the area reportedly fled to the Kamenge suburb of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Burundian national radio, a local administrator was killed in Kibuye in northern Kayanza province. His death was announced October 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banditry has returned to Bujumbura. On the morning of October 13, armed men entered the house of a UN employee and stole at gun point cash and other items. The employee was not hurt in the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent attacks were also reported in Mubeka and Ruvubu in Gitega province, but additional details were not available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Affected Populations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recently released MSF- Belgium report on the nutritional status of affected persons in Gihogazi and Nyogoro camps in Karuzi province states that global malnutrition in the camps stands at 14 percent while 3.7 percent of the children were found to be severely malnourished. 85.6 percent of the children were immunized against measles. In an effort to assist the severely malnourished, MSF-Belgium will establish a therapeutic feeding center with 50 beds at Buhiga hospital. There are 17 affected persons sites containing some 50,000 people throughout Karuzi province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public health specialists from WHO, the Ministry of Health and MSF-France worked in Kirundo Oct. 9-11 to investigate an outbreak of meningitis in the region. The team reported that from September 20 to October 10, 131 people were diagnosed with the disease, of which 32 have since died. The team reported that the population of the area in Busoni commune where the disease is prevalent is approximately 10,780 people. The team will soon begin a vaccination campaign and has stepped up its epidemiological monitoring of the area in addition to a risk-avoidance campaign among the local population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP states that during the reporting period it distributed emergency rations to over 8,500 people affected by recent clashes in southern Kayanza province. WFP also reports that it provided food for a UNHCR implemented reforestation program in northern Burundi and a CARE housing reconstruction program in Ngozi province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF-F Holland reports that it received an emergency air shipment of 36 MT of bulk drugs October 15. Fourteen MT of the drugs were imported on behalf of MSF-Belgium. The drugs will be used in rural health centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF reports that it distributed essential drugs for 50,000 beneficiaries to four health centers and two camps for war affected persons in the Bujumbura area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian Aid distributed 600 blankets and 500 pieces of plastic sheeting to vulnerable groups in Kayanza province. The NGO reports that its stocks of non-food relief items is virtually depleted. For several months, Christian Aid has been prevented by the embargo from transporting 60,000 blankets, 20 mt of soap and other badly needed relief items from Tanzania to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRS has begun distributing bean seeds and hoes to war affected persons and other vulnerable groups in Gitega province. Over the next month, CRS will distribute 252 mt of seeds and 21,000 hoes to 105,000 people in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Humanitarian Coordination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DHA/HCU organized a rapid assessment mission to Gitega province to ascertain the needs of affected populations in the region. The mission included representatives from: Christian Aid, CRS, ACF, World Vision, DHA, UNICEF and WFP. Participants visited five of sixteen sites in the province, and found a severe shortage of non-food relief items and a growing shortage of medicine. The team recommended that additional medical supplies and NFI items be distributed throughout the area, but acknowledged that endemic insecurity, the embargo-related prohibition on importing more NFIs and on- going fuel shortages make this difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DHA, in collaboration with the NGO Terre des Hommes, has been helping to coordinate other actors in the establishment of an educational infrastructure to serve the 1,400 children living at the Johnson Center and the CPPK. The two adjacent sites in the Kamenge district of Bujumbura provide care to war- affected people from the surrounding hills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DHA, in association with Italian Cooperation, is attempting to arrange an emergency cargo flight to Bujumbura for medical supplies. The flight, to be funded by the Italian government, will leave when a sufficient quantity of cargo is received from medical NGOs and UN agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a special flight from Nairobi, UNICEF received 200,000 doses of BCG vaccine on Oct. 13. The vaccines will be supplied to the national immunization program. The flight also carried approximately 800 kg of essential drugs for the NGO International Medical Corps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAO is continuing in its efforts to import the seeds and fertilizers which were exempted by the RSCC in Kigali on September 25. Contact has been made with the importer and the transporter in an effort to facilitate the clearance of the fertilizer through Tanzanian customs for transport by barge from Kigoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an effort to facilitate Caritas's shipment of bulk drugs and supplementary feeding materials from Kigoma, DHA has put the NGO in contact with the transport agents for the exempted fertilizer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Impact of Sanctions on the Delivery of Humanitarian Assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF's activities targeting displaced populations in the interior of the country have been temporarily suspended due to a lack of fuel. These activities include the construction and maintenance of latrines, hygiene and sanitation education, and the distribution of water by tanker truck. A combined fuel order for UN and international NGOs has been made, but supplies from Rwanda have yet to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As illustrated by the recent assessment mission to Gitega, the shortage of non-food relief items is becoming critical. As NGOs deplete their current stocks, there is a danger that victims of new outbreaks of fighting will not receive the necessary life-sustaining goods. In addition, NGOs and UN agencies continue to encounter administrative difficulties in importing sanctions-exempted goods into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the WFP regional aircraft continues its Nairobi-Bujumbura service, the number of available seats remains insufficient. This shortage has severely limited the ability of humanitarian agencies to rotate staff.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are thrilled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank God for the response of the NG Kerk in the Eastern Cape to God's grace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxford,England - Kitia Toure's novel &quot;Destins Paralleles&quot;, published in 1995 by Nouvelles Editions Ivoiriennes, Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, has been named as the winner of the 1996 Noma Award for Publishing in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second time in the Award's sixteen-year history that the winning book has been published in Cote d'Ivoire, and the third time that a novel in the French language has won. The book was cited by the jury as &quot;a remarkable subtle and sophisticated novel, extremely original both in concept and construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vigor of the writing and use of language is executed with tremendous confidence. It is a book about Africa in a very profound sense: traditional values and approaches to the resolving of problems are explored; and the impact of the West is portrayed with more discernment than is usual.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The novel constructs the narrative development around three characters with the same name and identical life backgrounds, but with divergent fortunes (the &quot;parallel destinies&quot; of the title). The three namesakes, Ki-Ca, are a ten-year-old poor orphan, an ambitious student, and an ambitious, unscrupulous politician. The web of interactions between them is brought into a single poignant focus at the end of the novel. The author portrays a cross- section of Ivorian society, focusing on the contrast between the dire conditions of the urban poor eking out an existence in the shanty towns, set against the blatant corruption and decadence of the ruling elite. the sharp socio-political satire is illuminated with subtle irony, and the sustained use of the monologue form enables the author to confront his social theme from a new, multiple perspective. It is an intellectual novel, but firmly based in reality; a political novel at the level at which society is at the heart of politics; and is sustained by an imaginative verve and inventiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The award will be presented by H.E. The President of Ghana, on Saturday 9 November 1996, during the 1st. Ghana International Book Fair, in Accra. In 1996 the value of the award has doubled to US$10,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women &amp; Geometry in Southern Africa. Some Suggestions for Further Research&quot; by Paulus Gerdes, published in 1995 by the Universidade Pedagogica in Mozambique, was awarded &quot;Special Commendation&quot;. The book was praised by the jury as &quot;combining in an ingenious way the study of geometry with that of the visual arts, presenting an important challenge and stimulant to the future of mathematics and education in Africa. It demystifies ethnomatics in relation to gender and race, and erases the borders between mathematics and popular culture as experienced in the work and crafts of women in southern Africa. the book's importance lies in its prospective impact on the education of African women in mathematics&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A record number of 176 titles, from 72 African publishers, in 19 countries, were submitted for the 1996 competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Noma Award jury is chaired by Walter Bgoya from Tanzania, one of Africa's most distinguished and respected publishers, with wide knowledge of both African and international publishing. The other members of the jury are Adewale Maja-Pearce, Nigerian writer and critic; and two new jury members in 1996 - Kay Raseroka, University Librarian of the University of Botswana, a children's book expert, and head of the African section of the International Federation of Librarian Associations (IFLA); and Dr. Thandike Mkandawire, a noted social scientist and until recently head of the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) in Senegal. The fifth member of the jury is Mary Jay, who succeeded Hans Zell in 1996 as Secretary of the Managing Committee (the jury).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In considering the record number of entries in 1996, the jury considered various issues about future directions of the award. To encourage publishers to be responsibly selective in submitting titles, they decided that, as from 1997, publishers would be limited to three entries each year. The maximum of three entries can be made at the publisher's choice between the three eligible categories: scholarly and academic, literature (including works of criticism), and children's books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury also noted with concern the continuing deterioration in production standards of many entries. Whilst they are conscious of the difficult manufacturing conditions prevailing in many parts of Africa, they nonetheless considered that standards in many cases were unacceptably low and not accounted for by lack of facilities. Whilst the jury has always paid regard to standards of production, this aspect will in future receive more critical attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury also single out four further books for &quot;Honourable Mention&quot;. They are (in alphabetical order by author):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Law of Interpretation in Ghana&quot; (exposition &amp; critique), by S.Y.  Bimpong-Buta (Accra: Advanced Legal Publication, 1995)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rope of Sand. The Rise and Fall of the Zulu Kingdom in the Nineteenth Century,&quot; by John Laband (Jeppestown, South Africa: Jonathan Ball Publishers, 1995).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ways of Dying&quot; (novel) by Zakes Mda (Cape Town: Oxford University Press, Southern Africa, 1995).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Whilst the battlefields of the South have been quiet over the past month, the streets of Khartoum have witnessed almost continual demonstrations against the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime. The regime's security forces have become so alarmed at the scale of the demonstrations that they have started to disperse them by using live ammunition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For three days in early September demonstrators protested against the policies of the regime. Six demonstrators were killed by live ammunition fired into the crowd from point blank range and scores were wounded. However, two of the regime's security agents were identified in the crowd by the protesters and they were hacked to death by the angry mob. Only heavy rains which resulted in widespread flooding across Khartoum brought an end to the demonstrations. Four of the six dead were named as: Karar Ali Mohamed, an eighteen year old bakery worker; Afaf Mohamed Adam, a female student at East Nile University; Huda Abdalla, a female student at the University of Technology; and Osman Mohamed Hussein, a student at Khartoum University.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police Factor - To avoid the blame for the eight deaths being attributed to its own security forces, the NIF regime attempted to place the blame on the police force. This angered the police authorities so much that they carried out swift investigation which revealed that all the ammunition issued to its officers on the days in question had been accounted for and not one shot had been fired by a police officer. Eighty police officers refused to be made into the regime's scapegoats and stayed at home, declining to go back to duty. A regime spokesperson backtracked on the original statement, saying that there had been a misunderstanding over the role of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Port Sudan Factor - It seems that the regime prevented a coup d'etat from taking place in Port Sudan in late August or early September and blamed the opposition National Democratic Alliance (NDA) for fomenting the trouble.  Rumours that eleven officers had been executed in the aftermath of the coup swept the country in early September and were given credence by the fact that Major Ibrahim Shams El Din had been dispatched to Port Sudan to sort things out for the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major Ibrahim Shams El Din is the regime's trouble shooter and has been responsible for some of its worst atrocities. He was responsible for the execution of twenty-eight army officers in 1990 after another alleged coup attempt. The twenty-eight were arrested, tried, found guilty and executed all in the space of two hours and were then buried in a mass grave. It is now believed that the story of the trial was a cover up, in order to give the incident a veneer of legitimacy. Apparently Lieutenant General Omer Hassan El Beshir, the regime's figurehead leader who signed the execution warrant, has told his close friends that by the time he signed the death warrants the officers had already been executed and he was merely ensuring that the regime's actions would later be seen as being legitimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known Murderer - Major Ibrahim Shams El Din, along with Major General Faith Erwa, the regime's current ambassador to the United Nations, were responsible for a mass of extra-judicial killings in Juba in 1992. The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) was very close to capturing the Southern capital and the two men were sent there to ensure that this did not happen. They terrorised the local population by randomly executing anybody they considered to be a potential supporter of the SPLA. Two Southerners employed by the United States Agency for International Development (USIAD) were executed in this manner. The errant major only left the South after he had a close encounter with the SPLA on the road to Torit. His helicopter was attacked and destroyed on the ground at Liria between Juba and Torit, and he was forced to flee back to Juba on foot. He has never returned to the South since. This time, Major Ibrahim Shams El Din was sent to Port Sudan to clear up the coup d'etat in his usual brutal fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military Action in the East - Elsewhere in the Eastern Sudan, the NIF regime has admitted that the forces of the Beja Congress and the Sudan Alliance Forces (SAF) of the NDA had clashed with its own troops near the border with Eritrea. The NIF regime insists that the Eritrean government is sending its own regular forces into Eastern Sudan in the guise of these rebel groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A military spokesperson in Khartoum announced last month that their forces had engaged NDA forces near the borders in September, but did not give any specific dates. The spokesperson said that the rebels had been forced back across the border into Eritrea and the situation had retirned to normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reality both Beja and the SAF forces have continued to operate inside Eastern Sudan throughout September, disrupting supplies from Port Sudan along the road and rail routes. Large numbers of troops have been seen on the road between Khartoum and Port Sudan, although none of them have arrived at the Port city. This suggests that they have been moved to other parts of Eastern Sudan as reinforcements against the activities of the anti-NIF regime groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Troubles in Machar's Camp - To add to the regime's headaches with rebel groups, one of its friendly militias is experiencing a crisis of leadership.  The regime has feted Riek Machar since the 10 April Charter was signed but has also been impatient for his forces to begin operations against the SPLA in Southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By mid-September, Riek Macher's autority over his Southern Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM) forces was being brought into question. Mr Machar ordered Gabriel Tang, one of his junior commanders, to move his forces from Zaraf Island at Pangak to join up with the forces of Timothy Taban Nyuon, another of his junior commanders, to attack SPLA positions at Kongor and Bor.  Mr Tang refused to obey these orders, insisting that he had reached local agreements with SPLA commanders in the area not to attack each others' forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Tang was then ordered to attack the SPLA forces of Commander George Athor at nearby Atar, which would have given the SSIM complete control of central Upper Nile. Mr Tang refused to carry out this order as well. Riek Machar them travelled to Pangak to try and personally persuade Gabriel Tang to carry out the orders. When this direct approach failed, he ordered Mr Tang to be disarmed and detained. Fighting broke out between the supporters of the two men, and Mr Machar is believed to be still trapped at Pangak in the centre of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, self-styled Major General Paulino Matip of the Anya Nya Two militia, who is also in alliance with the NIF regime, has returned to Bentiu after a period of treatment and convalescence at the military hospital in Omdurman. He is reported to be unhappy with recent developments. Firstly, he is unhappy with Riek Machar and Kerubino Kuanyin Bol for going ahead with the 10 April Charter without consulting him. Secondly, he is concerned about Arakis International extracting the oil from the Bentiu fields. General Matip was told to move his militia forces away from Bentiu and onto Leer to join in an attack on the SPLA at Bor but he has refused to follow these orders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - The hijacking of Sudan Airways flight number SUD 150 on 27 August ended on the morning of 29 August at London's Stansted airport when all the passengers and crew were released unharmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flight had set off from Khartoum to Amman in Jordan when it was hijacked by seen Iraqi nationals wielding fake guns and explosives. The hijackers demanded to fly to London, refusing to land at any Arab or Moslem airport. They only agreed to land at Larnaca in Cyprus because the pilot had convinced them that the plane did not have enough fuel to make the journey to London. Captain Abdel Hamid Hidirbi was to emerge as the hero of the piece for his calm handling of the situation and ensuring the safety of all his crew and passengers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sketchy Facts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Full details of the hijacking and the hijackers have not been made public.  Only the investigating authorities in Britain have a complete picture of the events. The facts which have emerged into the international media are sketchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven Iraqi nationals were accompanied on the flight by their wives and children. There were approximately 200 other passengers on the flight, including a small boy with a brain tumour who was travelling to Jordan for an operation. He stayed behind in Britain and was operated on in Cambridge at the expense of the British taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the hijackers have been held in detention in Britain and charged.  Members of their families were questioned by police but later released. They have since requested political asylum in Britain. It is unlikely that these requests will be dealt with until the criminal charges connected to the hijacking have been settled in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unlikely that the hijackers will be extradited to either Iraq or Sudan, and it is more that certain that they will be tried in a British court.  In fact, neither country has made any request for the extradition of the seven men. The National Islamic Front (NIF) regime has expressed its satisfaction with the British authorities' handling of the affair and indicated that it may well send officials to London to participate in the ongoing investigation. Khartoum's responsible behaviour probably owes more to its international isolation than to anything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good Relations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British media has taken the view that the seven Iraqis are opponents of Saddam Hussein who fear for their lives if they return to Iraq. Speculation included a view that they were part of the Shiite minority in Southern Iraq who were persecuted by Saddam Husssein in the aftermath of the Gulf War in 1991, and that they have been fugitives from the Iraqi regime ever since.  Such speculation, however, does not really fit in with the facts as known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NIF regime has had good relations with Baghdad since it took Saddam Hussein's side in the Gulf War of 1991. Iraqi advisors on military matters and chemical weapons production have worked in Sudan for the past five years.  Iraqi air force pilots have flown sorties over Southern Sudan and have been involved in the bombing of civilian targets there. Any Iraqi in Sudan today is likely to be an Iraqi government official of some kind or a member of the Iraqi armed forces. It would be very unlikely for an Iraqi Shiite rebel to choose Sudan as a safe haven from Saddam Hussein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraqi Activities in Sudan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraq is currently converting the old and disused ammunition factory at Shajara, outside Khartoum, into a chemical weapons production factory. At least one of the seven hijackers is believed to have been a technician working on this project. Four of the hijackers are believed to have been Iraqi government employees seconded to duties in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears likely that the Iraqis were officials who were being recalled to Iraq some time ahead of their scheduled departure dates. This signalled that something was amiss and the seven men feared that they would be arrested upon their return to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khartoum's Role</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some observers have speculated that the NIF regime stage-managed the hijacking in order to obtain some positive press coverage in the international media. Whilst this may sound unlikely, it is not beyond the warped mentality of the rogue regime of Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan Airways has suffered a spate of hijackings on its domestic flights recently. The only tow successful ones have been carried out by security officials of the regime, who have had little problem in taking weapons aboard undetected. A hijacking carried out by a newly wed and his bride was quickly foiled because he was not a security official. The authorities were certain that a weapon could not possibly have been smuggled on board and so the captains was ordered to return to the airport and the hijacker was overpowered and arrested. It is unlikely, then, that security would have been so lax at Khartoum airport as to allow seven Iraqis to take weapons on board an international flight. There is no way the Sudanese security authorities would have allowed seven dissident Iraqis to take weapons aboard a regular passenger flight. There is, therefore, more than meets the eye in the story of the hijack of flight SUD 150 as so far told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contradictory Stories</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khartoum has given out contradictory stories as to what the Iraqis were doing in Sudan in the first place. Initially, the Sudanese minister of state for foreign affairs, Mustapha Osman, announced that the Iraqis had been deported from Sudan. No further details were given. Not even the reason whey they were being deported or to where.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then the regime has not issued any denials that the Iraqis were government officials working on projects in Sudan. The regime has not said when they entered Sudan, from which country they came nor on what passports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was reported at first that the seven were unknown to the Sudanese authorities and this was later changed to say that they were ordinary Iraqi citizens who has spent some time living in Sudan. it is to be expected that British authorities have uncovered more of the truth and this will be eventually made public. For the time being, events surrounding Flight SUD 150 are not all that they might seem.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - The Canadian oil company, Arakis International, which is under contract with the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime to extract the crude oil from the Southern Sudanese oil fields at Bentiu, is planning to employ white mercenaries from South Africa as a security force to protect the oil wells, The mercenaries are being recruited through an agency known as Executive Outcomes. The mercenaries will be employed directly by Arakis and will operate independently from the Sudanese authorities in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that the Canadian oil company was not satisfied by the provision of 10,000 Iranian revolutionary guards and the NIF regime's own Popular Defense Forces (PDF) as a security force for the oil fields. The idea is to surround the area of the oil fields, making it impossible for the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) to infiltrate and sabotage the operation.  Arakis International is attempting to copy the Sierra Leone example, where South African mercenaries have been used to protect the diamond mining operations in the midst of the civil war in that country. However, there is a major difference in Sierra Leone where the mercenaries have been directly employed by the government rather than by a private company such as Arakis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complicated Dealings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arakis connection with the NIF regime is A complicated one. The original deal brokered between the two involved financing from Arabian Gulf countries and when this deal collapsed it cost the chief executive of the oil company his job. The present connection has a strong Islamic Fundamentalist bent to it. the new chief executive officer at Arakis is a naturalised Canadian citizen of Pakistani Moslem descent, Mr. Lutfur Rahman Khan. He appears to have been given a free hand by the president of Arakis International to spend whatever is necessary to make the operation in Southern Sudan a success. Whilst the financial profitability is far from assured, Mr. Khan has been guaranteed generous funding from the Iranian government. This is why the oil company is so ready to risk the lives of foreign employees in Southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canadian government officials have said that they are unaware of Arakis International's involvement in the oil fields of Southern Sudan. The Canadian government has not been consulted over the matter. As a private business transaction this is not at all unusual. However, the Canadian government will take an interest is the lives of Canadian citizens are put at risk because of the operation. The United States of America's state department has also expressed its concern about foreign employees of Arakis risking their lives in a war zone. It will be remembered that the American Chevron Oil Company first opened the wells at Bentiu and then had to close down the operation when several of its employees were killed in 1984, one year after the present civil war broke out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil Already Being Extracted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the various security forces have arrived in Bentiu, Arakis International has begun to extract oil and transport it to El Obeid in Northern Sudan. It is said that between 10,000 and 15,000 barrels a day are being produced and trucked to El Obeid, the capital of Kordofan province. The crude is being refined locally and/or used to generate electricity supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The profitability of such a small scale operation is debatable.  Unfortunately, it is the political factor rather than the economic factor which is justifying the operation at present. The simple fact that oil is being extracted from the Bentiu fields in Southern Sudan is a considerable propaganda coup for the NIF regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wider Coalition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the Iranian revolutionary guards and the South African mercenaries, the NIF regime has instructed the two renegade commanders, Riek Machar an Kerubino Kuanyin Bol, to send forces to help protect the oil fields.  The two renegade commanders have been instructed to set up a buffer zone between any SPLA forces and the forces directly protecting the oil fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerubino Kuanyin was instructed to move a force into the Twic Dinka country of Northern Gogrial in Bahr El Ghazal and to control the area from the north of the River Lol to Abyei and then to link up with Riek Machar's forces. The combined forces would be expected to confront any SPLA force moving towards Bentiu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commander Kuanyin took his orders seriously and moved his forces out of Gogrial town and headed for Twic country in late August. His forces were ambushed by the SPLA at Panliet en route to the River Lol and fighting there was continuing at the time of going to press with this edition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to understand how Southern Sudanese leaders could become involved in the exploitation of the South's oil reserves for the benefit of the NIF regime. It only goes to show how far Commanders Kuanyin and Machar have become the willing tools of the NIF regime. Whilst one can accept that Commanders Machar and Kuanyin have become so corrupted with lust for power that they are willing do anything for their own individual glory, it is not so easy to accept why their troops are willing to keep obeying their orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPLA Dilemma</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trying to prevent the NIF regime from exploiting the oil resources has presented the SPLA with quite a dilemma. The South regards the SPLA as its national army and so is looking towards it to protect the South's natural resources. There was satisfaction across the South when the SPLA forced Chevron to close down its operations in 1984. However, the situation today is not as straightforward as it was then. Back in 1984 the SPLA was a united organisation. The Arab militias went to protect the Bentiu oil fields were no match for it. Today, the SPLA has suffered schisms and a splintering of forces. It no longer has large numbers of forces in the Nuer territory of the Bentiu area. The only SPLA forces within the vicinity of the oil fields are in the Nuba Mountains to the North and they are fully engaged in a struggle against the regime's war of genocide against the Nuba people and so cannot be diverted to the oil fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another factor which could prevent the SPLA from creating a large force to attack the oil fields is the perceived crisis between the Nuer and Dinka people. Whilst the SPLA still has a large number of Nuer commanders and troops, there is the misperception that the SPLA is a Dinka organisation and the Riek Machar's renegade Southern Sudan Independence Army (SSIA) is a Nuer militia. Such is the state of Southern politics today that an SPLA attack on the Bentiu oil fields could well be misconstrued as a Dinka invasion of the Nuer tribal territory. The NIF regime would then be able to sit back and watch the spectacle of Southerner killing Southerner and the oil issue would cease to be the important factor. The outside world would quickly forget the Riek Machar's militia is merely another NIF unit arrayed against the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whilst the SPLA works its way around this dilemma, however, the South still expects it to disrupt the oil production. After all, what will the war of liberation have been for if the NIF regime can exploit the South's oil resources at its own convenience? It could be that Arakis International is waiting for an excuse to pull out of its contract with the regime. It is time the SPLA acted to give it that excuse to leave, just as the Chevron Oil Company did in 1984.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The exodus in 1994 of many experienced unionists into the government and business dealt the labour movement a massive blow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the likes of Jay Naidoo, Alec Erwin and Cyril Ramaphosa left, murmurings about a drain of talent rippled across the industry. The whispers were laden with concern levelled by unions and management alike that the movement would falter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has not happened, and the Mail &amp; Guardian spoke to four union leaders who have been credited by their peers with &quot;strengthening&quot; the movement following post- election losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) general secretary Kgalema Motlanthe; National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) general secretary Enoch Godongwana; Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) assistant general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi; and South African Clothing and Textiles Workers Union (Sactwu) general secretary Jabu Ncgobo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One industry source says many of those who left the unions to take up government posts were recently returned exiles who had although contributed little to the movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is sad sometimes when people purport to know what is happening within labour,&quot; he said. &quot;Some of the people who hold high profile positions now really did not do any of the slog work that was required to build up a worker base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some instances, they took the credit and did nothing. There were often people whom they left behind as shop stewards that deserved to be more than just that. Sometimes those union information officers or stewards were in actual fact general secretary material.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour analyst Gavin Brown says a &quot;serious crisis of leadership&quot; still exists in unions. It is not just a question of &quot;filling the gaps&quot;, he says, but &quot;nurturing and developing&quot; leadership skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown says it is also difficult for the movement to compete with the better prospects and pay offered in government and the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The players:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZWELINZIMA VAVI, assistant general secretary of Cosatu, was apparently born in 1962, or so he says. He has no exact birth date as he came from an &quot; unfortunate family who lived on a farm and was uneducated&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vavi's involvement in the trade union movement began at a young age, when he was still a student in the Congress of South African Students (Cosas).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says there was an important slogan used at Cosas which prompted him into valuing the &quot;skill of organising people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slogan used was: &quot;It is the duty of Cosas cadres to build organisations ... When you are with women, organise them, when you are with the youth, organise them and when you are with the workers, organise them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vavi says he started organising public service workers back home in an Eastern Cape rural town and developed a strong passion for organised labour.  He then moved from the South African Allied Workers' Union to work at a Vaal Reef mine in 1984 before being dismissed with thousands of workers during the National Union of Mineworkers' 21-day strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Involved in civic, youth and unions simultaneously, Vavi became regional secretary of Cosatu's Western Transvaal region and was &quot;quite dynamic&quot;, says one colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union, says Vavi, keeps the government in check and Cosatu, with its 19 affiliates and 1,8-million members, has proven that it is a force to be reckoned with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he says it is extremely difficult to adjust to a different tack of consultation. Dealing with the government often means &quot;thinking on your feet during negotiations and not leaving much time for consulting with member unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is difficult but necessary to make on the spot decisions in the interest of workers while bearing in mind that you have to find ways of making sure you include your members in your decision,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My personal view is that within the pressure, you always find ways to bring your members on board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vavi is facing elections next year during the federation's national congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JABU NGCOBO (46), general secretary of Sactwu - the third largest union in the country - formed an interest in labour in the early Sixties. This was when his father was sacked after 15 years of service. Ngcobo junior started work earning R5,95 a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within two years of starting work in Durban, Ngcobo was involved in a strike over bonuses. Frame Textiles, the factory where he worked, had no union, leaving 20 000 workers at the mercy of management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1973, Ngcobo led another strike, part of an action in which 100 000 textile workers downed tools for better conditions and a living wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngcobo is passionate about his work, reputedly organising and recruiting more than 40 000 workers singlehandedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A founding member of the Federation of South African Trade Unions, Ngcobo became regional treasurer of the federation in 1979. Within Sactwu he was a shop steward and national organiser before becoming general secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngcobo believes that no one &quot;should be held prisoner to the union&quot; and that unions should not rely on individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the unions are facing strain. It is not only the top layer of officials moving into other sectors, but also the second and third layers such as regional chairs and treasurers who are going into local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am saddened when the cream is skimmed from the unions. But we must realise that the strength lies in the union. It is the only place where black people have learnt to organise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENOCH GODONGWANA, Numsa general secretary, believes the only thing that has changed for a unionist since the 1994 election is the need to become more militant. A democratic government doesn't mean workers' conditions are any better, and complacency abounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The same injustices persist. The relationships between labour and management still reflect the pre-1994 situation,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If apartheid was the only problem, then there is no role for trade unions now. But that's not true. In fact, there is need for more militant trade unionism.&quot; Strangely, he insists he is not a militant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in the Eastern Cape in 1957, Godongwana joined Numsa in 1979, a year after he started work for Barlows in Alberton. He was immediately elected shop steward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moses Mayekiso's move into politics in 1994 opened the door to the general secretary's office; Godongwana was overwhelmingly re-elected at the union's annual congress in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) president Willy Madisha, who knows Godongwana from their days together in the South African Communist Party, says: &quot;He is a hardworking man, who has got where he is through nothing but determination and hard work.&quot; Godongwana has also been recommended for various government and private sector positions, Madisha says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Godongwana is ambivalent about the union movement losing good people. &quot;If somebody thinks they can contribute more effectively in nation-building in other sectors, that's all right,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 1994 exodus came &quot;at a time when we were facing new challenges and difficulties, when we needed experienced, seasoned and mature leadership&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union movement has now developed a leadership system at all levels so that &quot;as soon as there is a gap, we have other people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he is considering offers, Godongwana says he has no plans to move yet.  He adds, however, that he also won't be a permanent fixture at Numsa. &quot;When you stay too long you become a hindrance to progress. You become suspicious of new ideas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KGALEMA MOTLANTHE (47) is not a miner and never was. This didn't stop him rising through the ranks of the NUM to replace Cyril Ramaphosa as general secretary of the union - the largest in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, Motlanthe is critical of unionists in such a position. &quot;It is unusual for me to hold the position I hold as I am not a mineworker. But this is changing within the union itself, and so it should. I am now the only one who serves on the national executive that has not worked in a mine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motlanthe is respected by his colleagues for his dedication and commitment.  A tough but diplomatic negotiator, Motlanthe has proved the union can survive by drawing leadership from within its own ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nature never allows a vacuum, even when the most important leaders leave,&quot; he says. He adds he is by no means the best man for the job, citing several people who are capable and adequately equipped to be general secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motlanthe joined the union as an education officer in June 1987, after spending 10 years on Robben Island as a political prisoner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was acting general secretary for two years after Ramaphosa left the NUM and was only officially made general secretary at the NUM's national congress in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My own view is that the labour movement is relatively young,&quot; he says. &quot; The NUM is only 14 years old but the movement is nurturing potential leaders, almost aware that people move on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must realise that salaries are better in the private sector and we will only be able to keep our own within the union if we improve wages.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the rand continued plummeting this week, Minister of Finance Trevor Manuel said the proper response to the currency's woes lay in the steady implementation of the government's macro-economic strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market didn't agree with him, with many traders blaming the rand's spiral on a lack of a coherent policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rand notched up record lows on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday - hitting R4,7435 to the dollar on Wednesday afternoon. Its performance against sterling was equally dire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of going to press the currency had slipped to a personal worst of R4,7540 against the dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fall was initially pinned on comments at the weekend by Manuel and Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals that the rand had not yet reached a point where Stals had to deviate from his intention to base policy decisions on underlying economic fundementals. This was interpreted to mean Stals was reluctant to lift the interest rate - a decision at odds with market expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further contributing factors in this week's downfall of the currency, according to economists, is the weak current account, small capital inflows, the continued negative foreign perception of the maintenance of exchange controls and low foreign reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's foreign reserves fell to R10,04-billion in September - equivalent to four weeks' import cover - from R10,07- billion in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darkening the gloom, Board of Executors (BOE) economic consultant Rob Lee says in his latest Investment Outlook that the central government Budget deficit for 1995/96 will be 7,1% rather than the government's 5,8% target.  His projections for 1996/97 are 7,6%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The crux of the problem is that the most widely known or 'headline' measurements of the size of public sector borrowing exclude important components of state spending.&quot; BOE's Outlook says one of the main &quot;missing&quot; elements are the losses on the forward cover book of the Reserve Bank. The system is often used as a mechanism to protect the rand in periods of downward pressure on the currency, when &quot;cheap&quot; forward cover is provided to importers by the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee says there were net forex losses by the bank of R1,9-billion in 1994/95 and R3,1- billion in 1995/96. He is estimating losses at R5-billion for 1996/97.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee is recommending that the Reserve Bank withdraws completely from the forward cover market. However, he warned that such withdrawal would not be practical without an effective abolition of exchange controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The following disturbing implications are suggested by this analysis: South Africa is probably in the 'debt trap', real interest rates will remain very high, single-digit inflation is not sustainable and the prospects for attracting foreign capital are poor,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - On the beach, swilling beer or drinking Klipdrift and Coke - that is where the members of South Africa's most notorious death squad would, in-between their back-slapping and buffoonery, decide who would live and who would die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next week, just hours after Colonel Eugene de Kock is sentenced for more than 80 counts of murder and fraud, the SABC will broadcast an extraordinary documentary that illustrates the sheer banality of the evil that was wreaked on South Africa by the assassin and the men who served under him at Vlakplaas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Produced by Jacques Pauw, it is possibly the most skillful documentary ever made by the broadcasting corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pauw's career as an investigative reporter began in 1989 with official denials of his sensational expos' of the murders committed by members of the Vlakplaas counter- insurgency unit. It has culminated in a stunning film of confession, a series of avowals by men who worked deep in the &quot;heart of the whore&quot; of the horrors committed by the South African Police's elite death squad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the skill of the documentary does not lie only in the remorseless collection of detail about the murder-and-bedlam campaigns, explained in words of those who executed them, conducted by the security forces in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also a sensitive, sometimes even empathetic, probe into the milieu and mindset that produced these monsters. In that sense Pauw's film manages to function as an impressive piece of investigative journalism and also a social history of the most violent era in the turbulent life of this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grim details are all there, emblematised by grisly footage of a victim's skull split open with a spade wielded by De Kock and charred bodies in a minibus taxi that was shot up and blasted by the boys from Vlakplaas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More riveting, though, are scenes, taken from family photo albums and amateur videos, that provide glimpses into the culture of the men who did these things. &quot;I will never forget their eyes. They haunt me every moment of my sleeping hours,&quot; says Paul Erasmus, a security policeman who began his career by fighting with De Kock's men against Swapo in Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erasmus is talking about the children of a villager he had just shot and, while the victim was &quot;still dying&quot;, posed for a photograph &quot;with my boot on his back, rifle in my hand, like a big game hunter&quot;. It was the first man Erasmus had ever killed and that night he cried himself to sleep thinking it was the effect of all the booze he had drunk around the braai that evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is footage of mutilated bodies of Swapo guerillas, some with their ears hacked off for war souvenirs. One extraordinary photograph shows De Kock himself assaulting a prisoner during an impromptu interrogation in the bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were taught to hate,&quot; adds Erasmus. &quot;During our security course we were subjected to the rantings and ravings of a man best described as a cross between Eugene Terreblanche and Adolf Hitler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, he says, many of the men who went through that war with him are alcoholics and some have committed suicide. Eugene de Kock's brother, Vossie, acknowledges in the film that his brother's unit massacred ordinary civilians.  &quot;They had to commit too many atrocities which rebelled against his (De Kock's) ideas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film has a haunting section that details the creation and workings of the Vlakplaas unit. It repeats some of the gory and by- now-familiar accounts of how this death squad operated. But it also highlights the banality and buffoonery of the men who ran it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to describe a typical day in the life of a Vlakplaas operative, Lieutenant Peter Casselton replies: &quot;Arrive at about 8.30. Park your car. Sit around doing nothing. Open the canteen at about two. Start drinking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are extraordinary still photographs of a &quot;team-building exercise&quot; for the boys from Vlakplaas that was staged at Black Rock on the north coast of KwaZulu- Natal in the late 1980s: big fat men swilling beer and cavorting naked in the sea at the taxpayer's expense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You were,&quot; says former Vlakplaas commander Dirk Coetzee, &quot;God. You could decide (at events like these) who would live and who would die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last years of its existence the Vlakplaas unit, deprived of its political raison d' tre, was designated to tackle organised crime. In what is probably the most intriguing, and novel, section of the film, it shows how the operatives became embroiled in a criminal underworld of their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They indulged in strippers, an escort agency run by and for members of Military Intelligence, cocaine deals, foreign currency scams, gun-running operations, and illicit diamond-buying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in this period that the men for whom it had became second nature to kill underwent their final moral decay, losing even the perverse code of ethics that the killers abided by when they were soldiers in arms during their bush war days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vlakplaas inner circle fell out with each other over the drugs they took, the prostitutes they screwed, and the deals they did for personal gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock, whose principles never allowed him to indulged in the drug-and-sex culture that pervaded the unit, became paranoid and mentally unstable. He tried to have his one- time friend, womaniser Chappie Kloppers, killed.  Kloppers, in turn, plotted to kill De Kock. And apartheid's killing machine began to unravel at the seams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest is recent history. Kloppers and two Vlakplaas colleagues defected.  They were taken to Denmark where they gave a full account of their activities to investigators from the Transvaal attorney general's office. Their leader - a man they called &quot;Fok Fok de Kock&quot;, &quot;Brulle&quot; or &quot;Prime Evil&quot; - was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so began one of the most intriguing court cases, and television documentaries, in South Africa's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC1 will show the two-part documentary between 9pm and 10pm next week, probably on Monday and Tuesday, depending on when sentence is passed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A series of speeches in the past week has encapsulated the debate over the role of the media in this country's transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Reverend Frank Chikane, addressing a forum of 60 editors from around the Commonwealth, was quick to say he was not speaking on behalf of the deputy president's office, where he is a special adviser, though his words did reflect much of the thinking coming out of that office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the new order,&quot; he said, &quot;there are new roles the media can play.&quot; But the only one Chikane selected as appropriate was one in which the media helped in the &quot;national project&quot; to &quot;develop a just, equitable, non- racial, non-sexist, democratic society&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only appropriate debate Chikane allowed for was for the media to represent &quot;the different views of different parties in their debate around the question of the national interest&quot;. There was no place, in Chikane's view, for a watchdog press, little support for a tough, investigative voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Justice Arthur Chaskalson addresses a media gathering it is also of major significance, since as president of the Constitutional Court he is in the frontline of the defence against attacks on press freedom. Regrettably, Judge Chaskalson chose to emphasise to the Commonwealth Press Union the limitations to free speech: &quot;Press freedom does not entitle journalists to trample upon the dignity and privacy of others - a constraint that some journalists and newspapers are reluctant to acknowledge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He chose the unfortunate example of the use of Section 205 subpoenas to make journalists provide information to police - an odd thing to do while it is still fresh in public minds how the police tried to abuse Section 205 to collect evidence from journalists against the Cape Town vigilante group Pagad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was an unfortunate tone to adopt at a conference that would have hoped to hear the court president proclaim his determination to protect our new- found freedoms and, wherever possible, to push back the boundaries of free expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then came Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, ever the voice of independent and critical thought. &quot;We need a sycophantic, kow-towing, lickspittle media as much as we need a hole in the head,&quot; he told the editors' forum. &quot;It is quite crucial that we become used to asking the awkward question, 'But why?'; to refuse to be browbeaten by those who confuse authoritative with authoritarian; to cultivate the culture in which we refuse to become kowtowing and uncritical, scared of rocking the boat, afraid of not toeing the line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutu did express his distaste for the born- again critics who only developed the ability to criticise the government when the ANC came into power; and he did make a plea for the media to praise the new government as well as criticise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in his fundamental point, he was unequivocal: the kind of media we need is a critical and outspoken watchdog.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Angolan government has called on Southern African countries to exert pressure on Unita to implement the Lusaka peace protocol.  The call followed the forth extension of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (Unavem) last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council agreed to extend Unavem III for only two months -- from the set withdrawal date of February 1997 until April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative at the Angolan embassy in Pretoria, Jorge Morais, said the short extension was a reflection of the slow pace of implementation of the Lusaka protocol, and blamed Unita for the delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morais said although Unita had this week sent generals to Luanda to join government forces in a united army - a stipulation of the Lusaka protocol - more needed to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Southern African countries must put pressure (on Unita) for the implementation of the protocol. ... It is important for the region that peace comes to Angola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the UN extended Unavem III, a pessimistic picture of the country was painted by Angolans who continued to flee to neighbouring states, including South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The representative of the Southern African office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Yusuf Hassan, said despite the &quot;ceasefire&quot;, Angolans were fleeing Unita-held areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a feeling of uncertainty among the people. The process (Angolans fleeing) has slowed down but it has not stopped completely. There is a trickle every day,&quot; Hassan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR estimates there are over 300 000 Angolan refugees scattered in Southern African. Two-thirds were in Zaire, almost a third in Zambia and the rest in Namibia and South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arusha - Burundi's Tutsi military leader has bowed to regional sanctions and agreed to unconditional negotiations with Hutu rebels. But a weekend summit of East African presidents remained suspicious of Major Pierre Buyoya's assurances, declining to lift their blockade until talks are irreversibly on course towards resolving Burundi's civil strife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten weeks after seizing power, vowing there would be no negotiation with Hutu rebels until they laid down their weapons, Buyoya made the concession which many Tutsis argue will eventually lead to their extermination, but Hutus say is the only path to peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter from the major was delivered to East African leaders at the summit in Arusha, Tanzania, in which he agreed to talks with the Hutu rebel National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD) in the hope that the blockade would be lifted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the leaders declined to ease the sanctions until the talks are making headway. They set a one-month deadline for talks to begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continuation of sanctions was a snub to the United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who pressed the regional leaders to ease them when he met them the day before the summit. US and European diplomats argue that the hard line by regional powers leaves Buyoya little room for manoeuvring and plays into the hands of the most extreme Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In &quot;ethnically cleansed&quot; Bujumbura, which is a virtual Tutsi fortress, the blockade has hardened the resolve of many who believe they are struggling for survival against Hutu rebels intent on repeating the genocide of neighbouring Rwanda. Some argue that negotiation will inevitably lead to Tutsis losing control of the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Hutu politicians in the largest political party, Frodebu, and Hutu rebels say that nothing short of the restoration of democratic rule - introduced three years ago but snatched away within months by the army's assassination of Burundi's first Hutu president - can end the bloodshed that has claimed 150 000 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to the summit, the CNDD rebel leader and former interior minister Leonard Nyangoma warned the participants to be wary of Buyoya's promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maintain the sanctions until the conclusion of an agreement, or at least until the negotiations have reached irreversible levels,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Major Pierre Buyoya and his army, who initiated this crisis and its tragedy, are now pretending to be saviours. They are arsonists pretending to be firemen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Significant obstacles to negotiations remain. The military regime wants all parties to join round-table discussions which would first explore the origins of Burundi's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels and Frodebu say this evades the fundamental issues, such as reforming the military and reinstating a political system which respects the power of the Hutu majority. Even the site of the talks is contentious, given the dangers for Hutu politicians in the capital Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the summit, Buyoya had met two of the three demands laid down when the blockade was imposed at the beginning of August: the restoration of Parliament and the unbanning of political parties. The third was the start of talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Buyoya's reluctant agreement to reconvene the national assembly undermined his claim to be normalising government. At its opening, only 34 of its 81 MPs turned up. The Hutu speaker, Leonce Ngendakumana, who had sheltered in the German embassy in fear of his life, said 22 of those absent had been murdered. All the dead are from the mainly Hutu Frodebu party. Many other MPs are in exile or in hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unbanning of parties failed to impress the summit, which was divided on what to do next. Kenya and Tanzania, with the greatest trade links to Burundi, took the toughest stand for maintaining sanctions. Ethiopia, Uganda and Rwanda -close to the US and sympathetic to Tutsi fears of genocide - were willing to make concessions to Buyoya.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Members of a right-wing cabal long involved with Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the Inkatha Freedom Party may now have a say in who is next to rule Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister John Major, who faces a general election by next year at the latest, is running scared in the face of a challenge from the Referendum Party which is threatening to split the Conservative vote unless the UK government agrees to a plebiscite on British withdrawal from the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key figures in the Referendum Party have intriguing links with South Africa.  Its leader, Sir James Goldsmith, is a well-known Inkatha backer. A close friend of Buthelezi's, he is believed to have been involved in plans at one stage to set up a &quot;strike force&quot; for the Zulu leader, with the help of former members of the elite special forces unit, the Special Air Service.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldsmith, a legendary gambler, has also been involved in business initiatives in KwaZulu-Natal, bidding at one stage for the development of Durban's Point as well as showing an interest in obtaining casino rights in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another important figure in the Referendum Party, campaign manager Marc Gordon, is a former agent of South African Military Intelligence (MI). Gordon - who reportedly used to delight in wearing a sweat shirt bearing the slogan &quot; hang Nelson Mandela&quot; - was executive director in London of the International Freedom Foundation (IFF), an MI front organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFF made strenuous efforts in the early 1990s to smear the African National Congress over the Angolan camps scandal, as well as fabricating stories about links between the liberation movement and the Irish Republican Army. It is also believed to have fed &quot;intelligence&quot; to Margaret Thatcher while she was at 10 Downing Street. The IFF collapsed after FW de Klerk cut its funding in his &quot;clean-up&quot; of the intelligence services following the Inkathagate scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the late 1980s MI used the IFF to try to buy influence over American foreign policy in Africa, by offering to buy a R2-million executive jet for the current Republican candidate for vice-president, Jack Kemp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gordon was also a member of a British team of &quot;spin doctors&quot; brought in by Inkatha to advise them on the conduct of their campaign in June's local government elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Referendum Party, Tim Martin, told the M&amp;G this week they were &quot;very pleased that Mark Gordon joined the party to work with us&quot;.  They had looked into the South African links before he joined the party and were satisfied with the results.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A three-part documentary on transformation at the South African Broadcasting Corporation - Going Live! - was pulled off the air at the last minute by the corporation's management, who offered no explanation to executive producers Shane Mohabier and Saths Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically the documentary, which was due to be aired on SABC 1 on Tuesday at 7pm, was commissioned by the SABC to illustrate that it had finally rid itself of its shameful past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it seems the SABC's past &quot;shame&quot; has come back to haunt it, with some SABC insiders alleging that the programme's axing, hours before it was to be broadcast, was linked to &quot;a handful of people in the upper echelons&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They &quot;were unhappy with the criticism levelled at the SABC, especially after its relaunch. Going Live! was considered too sensitive and too premature, as hard-hitting criticisms were being made at a broadcaster attempting to meet several mandates,&quot; one senior SABC staffer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC blamed the delay on &quot;technical problems&quot;, adding that the producers &quot;were given a limited period in which to produce the documentary and it was not yet ready for broadcast&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mohabier, who refused to be drawn on the issue, said the episodes were delivered on time, with the first episode handed to the commissioning editor 11 days before the prescribed deadline. &quot;I am not willing to engage in a match with the SABC via the press but the documentary was on time,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An SABC spokesman said the decision to pull Going Live! was a &quot;combined management decision&quot; but it would be rescheduled within the next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each 26-minute episode explores mandates placed on the SABC, ranging from catering for 11 different language groups to affirmative action inside the corporation. The series also looks at editorial and political control of the SABC, censorship and whether it is meeting its viewers' needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the episodes make extensive use of archival material. Some of the footage includes the last appearance of Nelson Mandela as he is returned to prison following the Rivonia trial, and the assassination of Dr Hendrik Verwoerd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first episode explores the background to broadcasting in South Arica, from the 1920s to the introduction of television in 1976 and the new, transformed and relaunched SABC of today. The second episode looks at varied perceptions of issues haunting the organisation while the third episode defines what the national public broadcaster ought to be and looks at the SABC's funding situation and its vision for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a preview of the first two episodes, it was clear that the public perception of transformation is not all complimentary. Several guests pulled no punches - including National Party spokesman on broadcasting and party assistant secretary general, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, Cape Times editor Moegsien Williams, Performance, Arts, Workers' Equity vice-president Ramolao Makhene, independent producers, journalists and politicians as well as some high-profile SABC staffers such as SABC 3 programme director Christa Joubert, Focus presenter Freek Robinson and Independent Broadcasting Authority councillor Lyndall Shope-Mafole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the programmes are well-balanced. Criticisms are challenged by several SABC executives including Zwelakhe Sisulu, SABC board chair Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, television chief executive Jill Chisholm, channel heads and commissioning editors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the comments by guests on the programmes included: &quot;The (SABC) reshaping was a disaster ... witness to this was advertisers fleeing&quot;; &quot;The SABC has made a mistake about how it initiated the relaunch&quot;; &quot;We are wondering whether we got it (programming) right&quot;; &quot;SABC is a sad imitation of real TV&quot;; &quot;Lots of window- dressing at the expense of the taxpayer&quot;; &quot; Nepotism! Nepotism!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The grave lack of basic facilities in clinics around the country, undermining the government's new health policy, is revealed in a report to be published next month. Hundreds of clinics have no access to electricity and water. Hundreds, too, do not have telephones.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clinic network is central to primary health care - a key component of the Health Department's drive to provide universal health care. The government has spent R680- million on primary health care in the past 12 months, including R190-million on new clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the report, prepared by department consultants Health Systems Trust, shows that more than half the 645 clinics in the Eastern Cape do not have grid electricity. Nor do 126 of the 300 North West clinics and nearly a quarter of the Northern Province clinics. Adequate water supplies do not exist for nearly one-third of the clinics in the Northern and North West provinces, nearly half the Eastern Cape clinics and a fifth of the 402 clinics in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of government planning, clinics are to shift much of the burden away from main hospitals, providing a more cost-effective and wider spread of medical facilitiies. At present, many hospitals have to deal with minor ailments which could be treated at clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health Department Director General Olive Shisana declined to comment ahead of reading the report, but says some of the information could be incorrect. &quot; We take note of what they produce but it does not mean everything they say coincides with the facts,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, South African Health Review, also questions planning and funding for health policy, particularly the redressing of imbalances in provincial budget allocations. It says health policy remains hamstrung by lack of clarity about funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report notes that up to 1 000 new clinics could be needed to meet the government's primary health care aims. But it is not clear whether staff or money for recurrent expenditure are available, nor whether the provinces needing clinics have the capacity to spend the cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inability to spend could also delay the reallocation of resources between provinces. &quot;The ability of provinces which have previously been relatively underfunded to absorb significant budget increases is limited,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shisana says that she will wait to see provincial health spending figures before deciding whether the report's conclusion on spending ability is correct. She adds that decisions to build new clinics are only cleared once funding, including provision for recurrent expenditure, is agreed. Providing water, electricity and telephone links to existing clinics is a priority, although the timing hinges on performance by the relevant parastatal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department is providing R10 000 to each of the 2 358 established clinics for &quot;minor upgrades&quot; such as redecorating, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also says that the move toward universal health care is likely to prompt an increase in the number of patients referred from clinics to higher levels of care. However, it describes many existing hospitals as &quot; dilapidated&quot;, with &quot;crumbling electrical, water and steam systems ... Many facilities are nearing the end of their useful lifespan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a quarter of existing hospitals need to be replaced, the report says. The cost must still be determined.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg -They've been labelled reactionaries, racists and gravy-train wannabes, but the group of former United Democratic Front activists, church leaders, youth leaders and unionists behind the &quot;December 1 Movement&quot; believes the political salvation of coloureds lies in their hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are gathering in Cape Town this weekend to fine-tune plans for their launch, the culmination of months of debate, some of which has raged in the local press. There have been sharp skirmishes between African National Congress leaders and the proponents of a coloured movement and at times the debate degenerated into personal attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some, the movement is seen as a betrayal on the part of people who should be working from within political parties to correct weaknesses in addressing the fears and aspirations of coloureds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC provincial leadership elected last month will address the implications of the movement at a bosberaad they have planned for November 2.  The National Party, which enjoys the support of the majority of coloureds, has remained mum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movement was named to commemorate the emancipation of coloured slaves on December 1 1834. At this stage, the group is not willing to identify themselves - they will elect a committee on Sunday which will speak on their behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In discussion documents drafted by the movement's proponents and obtained by the Mail &amp; Guardian, some of their objectives emerge. The coloured community has confounded political analysts and dismayed activists by voting for the NP in the 1994 and 1996 elections. Former UDF activists believe this is a case of &quot;the chickens coming home to roost&quot; - a consequence of activists' inability to understand the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many had believed that the presence of coloureds at anti-apartheid marches and rallies in the past would translate into a &quot;vote for freedom&quot; along with other oppressed communities in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In post-apartheid South Africa, coloureds have been used by mainstream political parties as voting fodder, and their ongoing fears about issues like affirmative action and government allocation of resources like housing and education are not being addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movement's proponents believe a &quot;safe environment&quot; has to be created outside political parties to debate solutions to problems coloureds experience. They are also offering a haven to people who believe coloureds are a distinct racial group and would like a vehicle to promote their culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the objectives proposed in the documents are to draw coloured people back into the political and economic mainstream; to develop non- racialism in the Western Cape; to begin asserting pride among coloureds in the Cape with the aim of including them in the new South African nation; and to challenge other parties to change their political orientation in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group is still debating the organisation's character: whether it should be established as a political party, social movement, pressure group or cultural movement. This issue should be finalised on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, some of the inspiration for the movement's name is drawn from Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's speech at the adoption of the draft Constitution earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I owe my being to the Khoi and the San whose desolate souls haunt the great expanses of the beautiful Cape - they who fell victim to the most merciless genocide our native land has ever seen, they who were the first to lose their lives in the struggle to defend our freedom and independence and they who, as a people, perished in the result,&quot; Mbeki said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, as a country, we keep an audible silence about these ancestors of the generations that live, fearful to admit the horror of a former deed, seeking to obliterate from our memories a cruel occurrence which, in its remembering, should teach us not and never to be inhuman again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Cape today descendants of the indigenous population, mixed liberally with Caucasians and East Indian slaves, are claiming a unique heritage and recognition that their apartheid-designated label of &quot;coloured&quot; best describes their community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An argument is made in one of the documents motivating the name of the December 1 Movement, that coloureds were the only nation to experience slavery in South Africa and that the community has not yet come to terms with the trauma it caused. &quot;Our community's salvation lies in moving from ...  angst and trauma to our eventual coming to terms with the fact that we are an African people who have emerged at this special point in our nation's history along a path uniquely ours,&quot; the document reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The experience of slavery was not known to the rest of our nation. The essence of our identity was shaped within this crucible of suffering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need a movement that will form a bridge along which our people can move from where they are in terms of value and attitudes to where those less burdened by the shackles of history are to be found.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The National Sports Council (NSC) said this week it will investigate allegations of fraud against Athletics South Africa (ASA) which arose during the &quot;rigged contract&quot; scandal exposed by the Mail &amp; Guardian three weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations concern a fax sent on October 2 by ASA to Tommy Tesnar, the coach of Olympic 800m runner Marius van Heerden, which arrived mysteriously with an April 22 date imprinted on it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We as the NSC will ask ASA for an explanation,&quot; NSC chief executive officer Mvuso Mbebe told the M&amp;G. &quot;It is a serious allegation which amounts to fraudulent behaviour and we must conduct a thorough investigation before we can issue a statement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the story broke, ASA claimed that a contract prepared for the signature of Olympic silver medallist Hezekiel Sepeng was merely a &quot; discussion document&quot;, and that &quot;proof&quot; of this was the fact that the document was not signed. The contract included clauses stating that Sepeng should not attempt to break the South African record except at three meetings sponsored by Engen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ASA's story proved to be mendacious after an identical contract was given to the M&amp;G which had been signed by ASA chief executive officer Bernard Rose, Van Heerden and two witnesses. The fax was sent after Rose twice asked Tesnar to destroy the contract signed by Van Heerden in Cape Town on April 20. It contained a clean version of the original contract without the contentious clauses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't understand how it happened. Our transmission sheet shows that the fax was sent on October 2 and I can't answer for what came out on the other side,&quot; claimed Rose when asked about the April 22 imprint. He also denied having asked Tesnar to destroy the contract.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A funding crisis has virtually paralysed the South African Human Rights Commission just six months after it was launched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, set up to police the Bill of Rights, began swinging the axe earlier this week after failing to secure an increase in its R6,4-million budget, which is a third of what it estimates it needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission has costed its operations - which include establishing provincial offices, a public education drive and legal fees - at R18-million for the first year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The budget for education and legal fees is to be cut to R2-million from a planned R6,8- million. Only R230 000 has been set aside to cover legal and mediation costs - expenditure previously put at R1,5-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief executive officer Louisa Zondo says the cuts could jeopardise the commission's main programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials have, however, kept the salary bill at R4,5-million to cover 70 staffers, although so far only 22 have been recruited. Its five full-time commissioners receive packages worth a total R1-million a year. Vacancies include staff to register complaints. More than 400 complaints have come in since the commission's launch - just 20 are being investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Management is here but operations are not possible,&quot; Zondo says. &quot;You can't even get a letter on time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The commission may be concerned that government may not be attaching the required importance to building a culture of human rights. But it understands there is a limit to funds at the state's disposal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, chaired by Barney Pityana, was set up last year, and formally launched in March. It has spent much of its time introducing its activities to provincial government officials, and has also instituted several high-profile investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials from state expenditure and the Department of Justice audited the commission's budget proposal last week following a request from the Treasury Select Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department declined to comment on the findings, although deputy director general Japie Jacobs says it is &quot;definitely not true that state expenditure does not take human rights seriously. There are just too many holes to be blocked -the commission will just have to stand in line like everyone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The row over a woman's allegations that the Catholic church paid for an abortion when she fell pregnant during a love affair with a priest escalated this week when it emerged no sanction has yet been taken against the priest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Mansuet dela Biyase, head of the Eshowe diocese, confirmed he was telephoned by the woman, who complained the priest was avoiding her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her testimony at the parliamentary hearings on the Termination of Pregnancy Bill this week, the woman said when she spoke to Biyase he had indicated it would be understandable if she sought an abortion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is a lie,&quot; Biyase said. &quot;She wanted me to talk to the priest. I said I am not going to talk about this, this is a case of two adults who have had a love affair and it is not my business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She phoned more than once and I always avoided her ... I told her to go to the man concerned and to her parents - I said according to our custom the matter is always dealt with by the boy and his parents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether any sanction had been taken against the priest for breaking his vow of celibacy, the bishop said: &quot;That is the church's business, not the paper's business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the part of the priest, this will be dealt with in the course of time.  Certainly the church will deal with this matter. It will be a matter of conscience between the church and the priest himself and not for public consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be a talk between him and the authorities of the church but I am not prepared to comment any further about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Reginald Cawcutt, auxiliary bishop of Cape Town, has meanwhile denied the cash cheque he gave the woman was to pay hospital and doctors' fees for her abortion, but for psychological counselling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the priest had received counselling and been transferred from Cape Town where he was working. However, the Mail &amp; Guardian has established that the priest was due to return to KwaZulu-Natal in any event, as his three-year contract was up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cawcutt said when the woman approached him &quot;it was definitely after the abortion&quot;. She was in distress. &quot;I knew her as unbalanced and felt this would send her over the top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He gave her a cheque to meet a psychologist's bill she produced when he asked what he could do to help, and referred her to the church's own psychologist. The church continued paying for counselling sessions until &quot;a few weeks ago&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cawcutt said the issue would &quot;no doubt&quot; come up when the board of bishops met again in a few weeks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - One of the most forceful advocates for the Termination of Pregnancy Bill during three days of public hearings in Parliament this week was Dr Eddie Mhlanga, director of maternal health in the Department of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was perhaps understandable: his department after all had drafted the Bill, based on recommendations by a parliamentary ad hoc committee which heard thousands of submissions. But his contribution at this week's hearings had an extra dimension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am from Acornhoek, near the Kruger National Park in Mpumalanga,&quot; he said.  &quot;I am a born-again Christian, amen. I'm an obstetrician and a gynaecologist and also a public health worker.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a father blessed with two daughters, a man who has had a vasectomy because I believe that men have to take responsibility for their own fertility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hadn't wanted to become an obstetrician; he'd set his heart on becoming a surgeon. But in Acornhoek &quot;I saw women dying every day because there were no skills to save them&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While doing further training at King Edward VIII hospital in Durban, he treated a nursing sister who was brought in in pain and bleeding from what he diagnosed as an incomplete abortion. In the operating theatre, he discovered her uterus was gangrenous: he removed it, and her ovaries, and she was admitted to intensive care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every day I was at her bedside praying that God would have mercy on her ...  on the 16th day, she died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every year, well over 1 000 women in South Africa die because of pregnancy- related causes: about 400 of them are estimated to die because of septic abortions,&quot; Mhlanga said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His testimony proved too much for National Party health spokesman Dr Williem Odendaal, who rose on a point of order: &quot;This gentleman is a public servant. Is he trying to motivate the Bill or explain to us what it is all about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is making a submission like everyone else,&quot; said the chair, Dr Siyabonga Cwele.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a brief exchange, and Odendaal then left the chamber. More than anything, it demonstrated how times have changed. Five years ago, a Bill offering women equitable, legal access to safe abortions would not have been on the table. If there had been such a hearing on abortion reform, those advocating it would most likely not have been government officials and certainly not the Minister of Health. During this week's hearings, the fringe groups weren't those pushing for liberalisation but those describing it as murder and a crime against God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mhlanga's testimony, and that of Catholic lay persons such as Mary Armour and Dr Helen Moffatt, introduced a fresh element to the Christian witness that took up much of the proceedings: that of compassion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the end of the day it is unacceptable for a group of celibate men in a church in which women are barred from policy-making and the priesthood to both make and interpret moral laws on women's reproductive choices. To refuse women access to contraception as well as abortion is inhumane,&quot; said Armour, whose testimony prompted a delegation from the South African Catholic Bishops' Conference, which intends challenging the Bill in the Constitutional Court, to walk out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moffatt, who converted to Catholicism at 18 because it offered her the opportunity, under apartheid, of relating to people other than white, said: &quot; I am here to let you know there are pro-choice Catholics who in good faith and conscience support the Bill,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black women, the &quot;most silenced group in South Africa&quot;, suffered the most under the current legislation. &quot;I am pro-life but can't support a law that forces the most voiceless in our society to suffer so much ... as a comfortable, middle-class, white woman I realised I could not sit in judgment (of women who had abortions). Legislation must allow for the reality of women's lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The starkness of that reality was underscored by testimony from a young Catholic woman who said she had fallen pregnant in 1995 after becoming involved with a Catholic priest. She could not afford to raise the child and, after counselling, had an abortion. &quot;A member of the Catholic Church hierarchy wrote me a cheque which paid my hospital and doctors' bills,&quot; she said - a claim denied by the church, which says it only paid for her counselling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glenys Newbury of Victims of Choice (her husband is Dr Claude Newbury, head of the South African chapter of the Pro-Life Movement) described abortion as &quot; a genocidal attack on our black population&quot;, as well as an attack on womanhood and the meaning of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can only guess that some political or financial power is putting pressure on our political leaders and coercing them into doing something they must surely realise is an attempt to eliminate black people - and there is no easier way of doing this than by inducing them to kill their own babies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her reference to Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger's strategy of finding &quot;traitorous black leaders to sell out their own people&quot; enraged African National Congress members of Parliament and prompted the chairperson, Dr Abe Nkomo, to ask that she withdraw her remarks or leave. She was allowed to continue after making it clear she was not referring to sitting MPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Commission Rhoda Kadalie tackled the Christian lobby's arguments: &quot;The anti-abortionists are not so much pro- life as they are pro- vengeance ... my advice to those who are against abortion is don't have one, but don't deny others their right to have one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The very essence of our democracy is the freedom of each religious group to teach and preach ... to attempt to impose on women a particular morality based on sectarian beliefs goes beyond the legitimate role of religion in our political life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 90 groups and individuals made submissions, many of them failing to recognise that the task at hand was to focus on the Bill and suggest amendments, rather than re-open the moral debate over the rights and wrongs of abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What became clear, particularly from the testimony of poor, rural women convicted of procuring abortions or concealment of birth, was that in South Africa, the issue is not whether or not there should be abortion - but whether abortions should be easily available under relatively safe conditions, rather than dangerous back-room procedures threatening the life of both mother and child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Bill will be debated in the National Assembly on October 29 and in the Senate on November 5. The National Assembly's Portfolio Committee on Health began considering the Bill this week and will continue to meet on it until October 22, when it will go before the Senate Select Committee on Health for scrutiny. Members of the public can attend, but not participate in, the committees' proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Disaffected African National Congress members want Bantu Holomisa to lead the so-called Mass Democratic Movement (MDM), under whose banner he has been speaking at rallies drawing thousands of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Holomisa said: &quot;If the people in the MDM want to launch it as an independent movement I can't stop them. But the question of my leading the MDM at this point, I can't accept right now. I am focusing on my court case to fight for the restoration of my ANC membership.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the late Eighties and early Nineties the MDM comprised a broad anti- apartheid front of organisations and individuals allied with the ANC. Since Holomisa's axing as deputy minister of environment affairs and his expulsion as an ANC member, his supporters - mostly disaffected ANC members - have used the name to organise rallies in his support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa said organisers used the name because of ANC strictures against its members who invited him to speak at rallies organised in the name of the ANC, its alliance partner the South African Communist Party or the South African National Civics Organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will be addressing another MDM-organised rally at Rustenburg this weekend. A crowd of about 10 000 flocked to hear him speak at an MDM rally at Orlando Stadium in Soweto last Saturday, many dressed in traditional Xhosa garb and bearing knobkieries, pangas, assegais and sticks. One placard read &quot; Holomisa for President in 1999&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa used the opportunity to urge rallygoers to &quot;revive ANC branches&quot;.  One woman, who said she was employed by the Gauteng provincial government, said: &quot;General Holomisa must stop telling us to revive ANC branches. Then we can show our support openly. For example, I don't want to be expelled by my branch here in Soweto and end up with nowhere to go. If Holomisa was leading the MDM I would openly stand by him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member of the ANC Women's League said: &quot;Even we with no real influence in the party are scared to oppose the ANC openly. But I think it is only a matter of time. Holomisa must form his party so that we can fight this corruption.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A squatter from Alexandra township said: &quot;We are prepared to support General Holomisa if he forms his own party. He is the only one who can deliver us from the squatter camp.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the organisers of Saturday's rally was Weston Shabangu, an executive member of the Orlando West branch of the ANC, which also happens to be ANC veteran Walter Sisulu's local branch. Shabangu told the Mail &amp; Guardian: &quot;It is a pity that the party we so loved, we are now fearing. To me it is frightening how people are muzzled, they can't talk or contribute ... they are scared to do anything. We, the people on the ground, are not happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now we (the MDM) are mobilising our people to say to the ANC leadership how we feel. We gave them too much power and it has made them drunk. The people feel that the government has become arrogant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabangu said it was &quot;only a matter of time&quot; before the MDM was formally launched in Gauteng. A structure in the Eastern Cape has already been set up, according to Mabandla Gogo, organiser of an ANC branch in Umtata.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are individuals in the ANC who feel they own the organisation, forgetting that it is a grassroots organisation,&quot; he said. It is understood that MDM supporters in the Eastern Cape include members of the Pan Africanist Congress, church groups and civil servants resentful of the former Ciskei's Bisho, rather than the former Transkei's Umtata, becoming the Eastern Cape capital and who support the notion of what was once Transkei forming a 10th province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The base strategy appears to be to use the MDM as a pressure group, to mobilise disaffected ANC members who feel alienated from the organisation and see Holomisa as a champion of their cause. Should the judicial review of his expulsion which he intends seeking in the Rand Supreme Court fail, he could find himself with a platform ready to climb aboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was discounting such suggestions this week, however, and Shabangu and Gogo were not saying whether they were putting pressure on him to assume leadership of the MDM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a movement, not a political party, made up as I see it of ANC members who do not want to be seen to be defying the organisation,&quot; Holomisa said. &quot;It might be gaining momentum - if the feeling is strong it can express the views of the people. If they want me to lead it, they have not yet approached me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he still saw himself as an ANC member. &quot;The people who chased me away were not the ANC, only a few leaders,&quot; he said. If his court action failed, he would re- apply for ANC membership. If that was rejected, he would make a direct appeal at the ANC's national congress at the end of next year. &quot; When I have exhausted all avenues then I will see what I can do,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the moment there is nothing attracting me to establish a new party or lead a new movement.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Evidence that Gold Fields's racial classification of workers could have contributed to the promotion of slaughter at the company's mines has emerged at the Myburgh Commission of Inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence, which showed that the company identified workers' ethnic backgrounds on their clock-in cards, followed a startlingly frank account of the mine's ethnically centred approach to recruitment that boiled down to: Shangaans are very good with machines, residents of Lesotho are good at shaft- sinking, but Englishmen and Afrikaners are good at everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, chaired by Judge John Myburgh, followed 48 deaths related to ethnic conflict in the past three months at three of Gold Fields's operations. Myburgh, who has succeeded in having his commission stay on for six months to address mine violence in general, recommended the abolition of ethnically segregated hostels. Attorneys acting for the National Union of Mineworkers told the Mail &amp; Guardian they believed ethnicity merely provided mineworkers housed in appalling conditions with a convenient way to target co- workers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to transcripts of the commission's hearing which recently became available, Jeanette Neevling, an advocate acting for the commission, said she had statements from witnesses claiming they were &quot;asked by perpetrators for their clock cards. And one of the witnesses was a Shangaan and one was a Zulu.  &quot; She asked William Eksteen, the mine manager from Northam Platinum: &quot;So do you agree that their cards depicted ... (their ethnic background)?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eksteen replied he was not sure, but said he would check with his colleagues. &quot;And do you also agree with me that it is not necessary information on the clock cards and that you should reconsider the use of that kind of clock card?&quot; Neevling asked. Eksteen replied &quot;Yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Munro, executive director of the company's gold operations, confirmed this week the company identified workers' ethnic background on their clock-in cards at all its mines. He told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the abolition of racial classification on workers' time-shift cards would be one of the first reforms undertaken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When first approached for comment Munro said the matter would be dealt with by mine management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what the purpose of the ethnic tags was, he said: &quot;I do not know. But it should be changed.&quot; In a subsequent conversation he said he would personally oversee the ditching of the system which was applied at all Gold Fields operations. He said other mining houses allocated workers numbers which reflected their ethnic backgrounds and that these should also be done away with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Munro's statement to the commission, he said: &quot;The fact (is) that over the years various ethnic groups appear to have made certain aspects of mine labour their own in terms of skills ... For example it is well accepted that persons from Lesotho are skilled in the shaft-sinking activities and this leads to direct recruiting efforts accordingly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mine manager Eksteen said: &quot;The Zulu people are excellent in production sections, like the Swazis in drilling machines. If we talk about operating percussion machines, they are very good in doing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Xhosas, he told attorney Tefo Raditapole, who was appearing on behalf of the National Union of Mineworkers: &quot;...When it came to smelting operations and running furnaces they could do that very well. They also showed that as operators of scoop trams ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told Raditapole he could not say what the Tswanas excelled at but &quot;...  the Mbatlas have a particular job that only they do and nobody else. And we know the Shangaans are very good mechanical people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raditapole pursued the same line of questioning with chief personnel officer David Poole. Poole said both Afrikaners and English-speakers could perform a wide range of skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour Minister Tito Mboweni welcomed Myburgh's report but said it failed to investigate management's role in the conflict adequately .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Organisers of the first post-apartheid census have spent the opening days of the exercise defending themselves against a nationwide outcry among the unemployed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Managers in all nine provinces say that threats and intimidation by those not employed for the census have rendered many areas off-limits. Some workers have been beaten up, others savaged by dogs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials have also had to appease disgruntled political parties and civics groups, which had expected the R365-million programme to spur mass job creation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indications by the government that the census would provide work for the unemployed led to more than 500 000 people applying for 100 000 posts. The recruitment process was completed just before the census started last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many who failed to make the grade claim that those recruited were already working - a view fuelled by the selection criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Statistical Service (CSS), which is running the census, made Standard 10 education a basic requirement, with higher posts demanding qualities such as a car, management experience and tertiary education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the statistical service's head, Mark Orkin, says that 90% of those recruited were unemployed, although many of the administrative and managerial posts were filled by people already in work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says just 80 of the 80 000 demarcated census areas (each representing 120 to 250 households) have been affected by the disputes - a level not likely to derail the information-gathering, due for completion on October 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But such arguments have not halted a spate of incidents across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enumerators earn a minimum R1 000 for three weeks' work; their immediate superiors R1 500 for each enumerator they direct (up to R7 500), and their superiors R2 500 for the first month and R70 per area they oversee (50 areas is a rough average).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are trying to turn the census into an unemployment forum,&quot; Western Cape census manager Edward Tiltman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng's census has been disrupted in several areas, said manager Thabo Masemola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mpumalanga census has similarly stumbled in some districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The North West province says it will not finish its census by the deadline.  It had to re-test job applicants in some areas, including Schweizer-Reneke, because of opposition from those turned down. &quot;We are spending a lot of time explaining these matters, rather than seeing things are in place, &quot; said provincial deputy manager Jean Ditsebe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police had to step in after outraged residents mobbed enumerators in Umtata, Transkei, on the first morning of the census.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the civic associations and political parties that have been frequenting our offices,&quot; said Northern Province census manager Surprise Hlungwani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the incidents have been blamed on the South African Unemployed Workers Union. Its head office, however, denies that it leads the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The census has also faced a string of other problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mpumalanga, thousands of farmworkers remain outside the process.  Mpumalanga census manager Kobus van Wyk said farmers are too remote or too busy to participate, even if enumerators were available (which in many cases they are not).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solution currently is to leave the forms with the farmer, in the hope that he will complete them for himself and his employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Free State, female enumerators have been barred access to gold mines in Welkom. Two enumerators in East London are alleged to have asked for cash from residents to fill in the forms. Enumerators in other provinces have been fired for completing the forms themselves (though officials say such cases are isolated and easily spotted).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials remain confident that the census will meet its aims, and that the margin of error in the counting will be far less than the 15 to 20% achieved under the previous government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result will only be known in March, after results of a quality check on 800 areas - to be undertaken next month - are analysed. Orkin says a 4% margin of error would be a good result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds, however, that next time - another census is planned in the first year of the next century - staff recruitment will be completed long before the census starts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Amalgamated Bank of South Africa's (Absa) legal battle with Bob Aldworth has taken a startling twist, with the disclosure that counsel acting for the bank helped frame the charges against its former executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Absa's senior counsel, a former deputy attorney general, helped pen the charge sheet for the state's fraud case against Aldworth - a procedure which should have been carried out by the state's own advocates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian has learned that the Johannesburg attorney general's office has admitted in writing to allowing Etienne du Toit SC help draft a new charge sheet against Aldworth. What makes the choice of Du Toit striking is that he is acting for Absa in its related civil case with Aldworth, who is suing the banking group for damages.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorney general's office confirmed yesterday that Du Toit &quot;approved&quot; the final charge sheet. &quot;If I was offered assistance from such a learned authority I would undoubtedly take it,&quot; state advocate Bradley Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new charge sheet is understood to differ substantially from the one it replaces and contains charges that were known only to Absa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When approached for comment Carl Boden, Aldworth's attorney, would not deny that there had been correspondence between Aldworth's legal team and the attorney general's office &quot;along those lines&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal sources in private practice said that if Absa has handled the charge sheet, the state's case against Aldworth could be jeopardised. It was &quot;quite improper&quot; for the attorney general to seek the assistance of a lawyer acting for Absa in a related civil case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The attorney general is not an ordinary litigant. His duty is to serve the public interest and to ensure that the prosecution is fairly instituted only after independent inquiry,&quot; said one advocate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case against Aldworth has been delayed three times and is expected to be delayed again when he appears in court on November 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges against Aldworth relate to his alleged use of about R414 000 of Absa money for his own personal use in 1993, a charge which led to his dismissal. Aldworth is bringing a civil case against Absa for loss of earnings and other relief. Aldworth returned this year from Britain to face the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith, who is assisting deputy attorney general Jan Henner with the prosecution of Aldworth, initially said that Du Toit's role was &quot;not of tremendous significance&quot;. Du Toit had not made a written submission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Smith then conceded that Du Toit was asked to contribute: &quot;His role was one of approval - he approved the final charge sheet ... he did provide input and assistance in drawing it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the reference on the charge sheet - Co.../hed/uph/JL/0827 - was similar to that on Absa documentation relating to Aldworth and his co- accused Alan Upham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Attorney General Kevin Attwell said it was rare for a plaintiff to help draw up a charge sheet. &quot;We have to draft it, approve it and authorise it. Obviously anyone can give us a document, but if that forms the basis of what we do that's fortuitous. Etienne is a good lawyer and a very good framer of charge sheets. He's a man with a proven track record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Aldworth published a book on his and three other executives' experiences with the bank. He paints a picture of a bank that was bent on obsessive vendettas - against himself, British businessman Julian Askin, former Allied Bank chief executive Kevin De Villiers, and former Trustbank boss Hennie Diedericks. Among the book's threads are numerous suggestions that Absa has exerted excessive influence over the legal system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book ends with an analysis of Absa's demand that Bertrand Hoberman - the lawyer who chaired a commission of inquiry into the liquidation of Tollgate, a company which banked with an Absa subsidiary - recuse himself.  The demand followed evidence about the controversial R1-billion Reserve Bank &quot;lifeboat&quot; to Bankorp, a struggling bank that became part of Absa in a series of spectacular takeovers that led to the consolidation of all South Africa's Afrikaans banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Toit was unavailable for comment in Kimberley at the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louw van Wyk, a group executive director at Absa, said: &quot;It is not uncommon to use people in drawing up charge sheets. We originally laid the charges and a lot of the information is with us. But as far as we are concerned it is the state's case.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Government consultants have proposed closing down a number of national museums, including the War Museum of the Boer Republics, the Afrikaanse Taalmuseum in Paarl, and the William Fehr Collection in the Castle in Cape Town, to make way for two new flagship museums to be based in Gardens, Cape Town and in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposals - guaranteed to provoke a storm in the museum world and among traditionalists - were leaked to the Mail &amp; Guardian this week, after the Department of Arts and Culture refused to disclose the Deloitte and Touche survey it commissioned, on the grounds that it might be taken out of context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey also proposes that the Natal Museum in Pietermaritzburg be relocated to Durban, the National English Literary Museum be amalgamated with the English Dictionary Unit in Grahamstown, and some of the smaller museums be amalgamated into the flagships as educational and exhibition centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Transvaal Museum and the National Cultural History Museum are envisaged as the core of the new Gauteng-based flagship, and the South African Museum, the South African National Gallery and the South African Cultural History Museum the core of the Cape Town flagship.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Themba Wakashe, chief director of arts and culture, downplayed the importance of the survey - alleged to have cost the government more than R1- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Deloitte and Touche survey is only one of many documents that will be taken into consideration when the review committee decides how to restructure museums,&quot; he said. Other documents include the government's White Paper on Arts and Culture, the Arts and Culture Task Group report and reports by the Directors of National Collections. Decisions should be taken with the next two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deloittes has indicated that a number of the museums the government is currently funding are not relevant. The survey says of the Afrikaanse Taalmuseum: &quot;The museum does not fit the concept of a national institution and presents a narrow element of South African heritage. It has limited revenue- generating potential, it is not located in the major population centre of the province and it has limited potential as a public attraction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deloitte and Touche base its proposals on a survey done by chartered accountants of South Africa's 18 national museums. The accountants assessed the museum's activities, their ability to generate funds, and their plans for the future. They then drew up a report that proposed deproclaiming all national museums and replacing them with the two flagships. The two flagships together would make up the Magi - the Museum and Art Gallery Infrastructure - and they would be responsible for the bulk of research, design, development and distribution of exhibits and educational programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the department's attempts to keep the Deloitte and Touche report confidential, leaks have already filtered down to museum workers who are outraged that a survey conducted by chartered accountants is to guide government in assessing the worth of the nation's cultural assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the review committee, Dr Rautenbach, said this week: &quot;Conceptually the survey is on track, but the nuts and bolts of their proposal is way out.  But it's my perception that the department is seeking the best solution and the Deloittes model will not necessarily be implemented. Some of the museums must go ... The department is listening to all stakeholders, but there is a lot of complaining because personal agendas are at stake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marilyn Martin, director of the South African National Gallery, said she was confident that the survey would have a positive impact on debate because it was important to have a financial analysis on which to base decisions.  However, she felt the survey needed to be aired in the open, so that individual institutions could each see how they had fared in the study, and improve if necessary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Imagine a radio station solely dedicated to sport coverage or jazz or classical music. Imagine tuning in your radio and discovering a station which broadcasts only horse racing or predominantly local music by African artists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strange as these scenarios may seem, they are some of the 21 applications received for three new medium wave (MW) and five new FM licences to be awarded before the year-end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second wave of prospective new radio owners, following the sale of the South African Broadcasting Corporation's six regional radio stations, will provide listeners with a large variety of choices and contribute to the growing diversity of the media industry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An FM format allows for more entertainment (music), while an MW format allows for more specialised broadcasting (talk radio) which is demonstrated by the array of applicants received by the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of transmitting music across the airwaves, the sound quality of FM is usually 10 times better than MW, and one can receive stereo on FM which is not available on MW.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closing date for applications and written representations was September 30, with hearings proceeding next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Afrikaans talk radio - Punt of Mediumgolf - as suggested by the Punt Media consortium is planned for the AM (specialised) frequency band in both Cape Town and Gauteng. The market, according to the consortium's application, is &quot;Afrikaanses&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Afrikaanses like to laugh. From the Afrikaner Yuppie in his BMW to the old Boere-omie on his Deutz tractor. Humour is an integral part of the culture and language ... and they often laugh at themselves,&quot; states an excerpt from the Punt Media consortium's application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radio station aims to be bold enough to tackle controversial issues and hopes to add a breath of fresh air for the new Afrikaans generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moribo consortium, consisting of Moribo Investments - the leisure and entertainment arm of Thebe Investment Corporation - together with Anglovaal Limited, the Media Workers Association of South Africa and Cape Newspapers (of the Independent Group), is also applying for an AM licence in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radio station - the proposed World Sport Radio Cape Town - aims to offer a &quot;unique format&quot; of live sport targeting sports fundis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports commentary, reports, results and interviews are the aim of the radio station. In its application the Moribo consortium says it aspires to provide entertaining quiz shows and hopes to make the sports radio station the &quot;only one of its kind on offer in the country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another interesting applicant is the Win FM consortium, applying for an FM licence in Gauteng. Headed by Sandy Fletcher, who is also involved in Cani FM, a community radio station which caters for the most affluent areas in Sandton to the poorest of Alexandra township, Win FM aims to be a radio station dedicated to horse racing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fletcher says it will broadcast national horse racing to a local audience and will &quot;obviously be connected to a lot of general sports news&quot;. The radio station will have multi-formatted programming which will appeal to different people at different times of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a captive audience for Win FM as there are vast numbers of punters who have no radio service catering for their needs, Fletcher argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solid Gold Radio, headed by Tony Sanderson, is applying for a FM licence in Gauteng. Sanderson says it will be a &quot;unique&quot; radio station as South Africa does not have a commercial radio station dedicated to playing music hits of the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties and early Nineties. &quot;Most radio stations pay mere lip service to Golden Oldies, but Solid Gold will do more than this,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its application, Solid Gold says it will be keeping with a &quot;unique and distinctive style of presentation (with) all speech- based programmes kept entertaining, punchy, slick, fast moving and brief&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the Solid Gold listener will never be &quot;patronised nor regarded as anything but an intelligent individual&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applicants for FM licences in Durban are concentrating on Zulu-based programming with the Real Radio consortium pushing for a licence for its proposed KZfm radio station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative for the consortium said the ratio would be 70% Zulu to 30% English language programmes, adding that the programmes will cater for 15 to 35 year-olds with its local music content &quot;going beyond&quot; the quota set down by the IBA. It will be 60% music. The station, he says, will have a &quot;kind of urban Durban feel ... When you listen to it, you'll want to take your shirt off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other consortium - Radio One FM Limited - has an endorsement letter signed by King Goodwill Zwelethini and will have 90% of its programmes in Zulu. Its format will be a combination of talk and music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to most applicants' claims that their radio formats are 'unique', many have chosen interesting names including: Zebra FM, the motivation being that Zebra stripes would make a funky logo; Jozzi 99.2 FM, television presenter Tim Modise's consortium; and Jozi Radio, Moribo consortium. Jozi or Jozzi is a slang term for Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Objections have been lodged against some of the radio stations, including the Moribo consortium applications, Jazz FM consortium and Win FM Stereo.  These objections were being scrutinised by the IBA. However, at the hearings scheduled for next month, where oral representations will be made to IBA councillors, the Broadcasting Act will no doubt be quoted several times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the hearings are completed, South Africa's radio industry, though not unique, will be in line with most international media industries where there is an abundance of choice for listeners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In its ongoing search for innovative solutions to the housing crisis, the Ministry of Housing's special task team this week proposed new approaches to break the deadlock between financial institutions and developers, which is holding up housing delivery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report released this week, it also urged the various arms of the government involved in housing to set clear targets, disclose decisions and speed up the processing of approvals as well as its approach to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is common cause that the public sector is parodied as inefficient, and that it serves itself rather than the public, and seldom with civility,&quot; the task team said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report has been presented to Minister of Housing Sankie Mthembi- Mahanyele, who will consider its recommendations before making a final decision on the proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chaired by Department of Housing Director General Billy Cobbett, the task team said the delivery of subsidised housing was now showing &quot;a marked increase&quot;, with about 10 000 subsidies being paid out monthly by the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between June 1995 and May 1996, banks had made available R3,08-billion in credit for housing, of which R765-million was for subsidised housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But large-scale developers and banks &quot;remain largely uninvolved&quot; in the market for houses valued at between R18 000 and R50 000, &quot;often blaming each other and the state for their non-involvement&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task team said the government &quot;should resist the temptation to merely attack and scapegoat the private sector while it still has too many deficiencies of its own to resolve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Indeed, the past few months have seen some significant shifts within the private sector where a greater willingness to engage and take higher levels of risk has been displayed with commendable results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said it was also concerned that there was still an emphasis on &quot;one- family-one-plot&quot; type of housing developments, &quot;which, in planning terms, is a disaster&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This posed the &quot;very real danger&quot; of apartheid-style housing patterns being repeated, while also preventing the provision of more affordable housing options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also criticised the emphasis on individual ownership rather than other forms of &quot;social&quot; security of tenure, such as schemes run by housing associations on a share block basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task team recommended that the present state subsidy be standardised at R15 000, which would be matched rand for rand by local authorities or employers and granted to people earning less than R2 500 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was hoped this would, in particular, encourage employers to start providing housing for their workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For large-scale projects, the R525-million set aside for housing in the Reconstruction and Development Programme would be used to help provide 150 000 low cost, high density units over the next four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task team said R400-million would be used to underwrite commercial risks and R100-million would be invested in joint ventures with the private sector.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Automakers, the embattled manufacturer of Nissan and Fiat Uno cars, confirmed this week that a delegation from Nissan Japan had been in South Africa amid speculation that the Japanese were eyeing a substantial stake in the local company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry sources said the Japanese company was seriously considering an acquisition, adding that if a deal were struck it would be in the next few weeks or not at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nissan representative Johan Kleynhans said the possibility of Nissan Japan buying into Automakers was discussed on an &quot;on-going basis&quot; but he could not say whether it had been the subject of the latest meetings. The Japanese delegation had been in South Africa earlier this month, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kleynhans added that delegations from both Nissan Japan and Fiat visited the company frequently to discuss production plans and generally maintain links. He said since its listing last year the company had gone on record saying it would welcome an investment from Nissan Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquisition by Nissan Japan of a major stake in Automakers would square with the investment policies of Automakers' main institutional shareholder, Sanlam, which has indicated it wants to cut its investments in non-financial services interests to below 15% and sever all management links.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanlam chairman Marinus Daling told the Mail &amp; Guardian recently that Sanlam, which has a 51% stake, was clearly disappointed in the performance of Automakers since its listing - the share, one of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's worst performers, has sunk as low as 214c from a post-listing high of 650c. He said Sanlam's continued investment in Automakers had to be seen &quot; in the context&quot; of its recently stated investment policy. Nissan Diesel and Mitsui together have a 14% share in the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquisition would also come at a time when Automakers is coming under intense pressure from competitors, particularly in the entry-level car market.  The group, whose share price was 244c at the time of going to press, recently announced a massive retrenchment programme aimed at 900 of its 4 800 workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Union of Mineworkers and the company have failed to agree on the retrenchment exercise in mediation. Reports this week said the union had applied for an urgent interdict, scuppering Nissan's plans to issue retrenchment notices to 600 workers at the end of the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the union's demands is a breakdown of senior executives' salaries and the costs of running luxury country retreats the company bought at the time of the listing for its executives and clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the company's claims that the lodges were necessary for marketing, competitors such as Volkswagen, BMW and Toyota told the M&amp;G they had no company-owned retreats.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin this week dismissed suggestions that the proposed $70-million World Bank loan signaled a deviation from stated government policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a new borrowing initiative. We have set borrowing limits for this financial year and coming years, sourced from the domestic capital market, the international market and international financial institutions (IFI).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is merely the first slice of the IFI component.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank doesn't just hand out money; funds have to be targeted towards certain projects. So this particular programme seemed the perfect starting point, being a scheme designed to promote export competitiveness, worked out in close co- operation between the departments of finance and trade and industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But,&quot; he explains, &quot;if we hadn't taken this particular route, the project would still go ahead, albeit at higher cost, because we would have had to seek financing elsewhere, at less favourable rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From a financial point of view, the two are de-linked - funds are fungible - but from a logistics point of view, because World Bank loans are project- linked, we've tied it to a particular package of our programme that was going on anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFI loan terms are not automatically preferential, particularly when denominated in strong foreign currencies, and frequently come with a price - notably, conditionality. Some commentators see this first loan as the start of the slippery slope to interference in the South African economy by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Erwin insists this case is different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not allow new borrowing from the IFI. That would only distort our Budget and future budgetary flows. This deal is within our limits and our policies are consciously designed to prevent the possible pitfalls of a World Bank loan and the effects they've sometimes had on other economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's ridiculous to say this money will affect our economy. And we'd be stupid to pass up the opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, according to World Bank officials, it's early days yet. A Washington delegation has still to meet with government officials to iron out the details of a potential loan, which will then be presented to the World Bank board for authorisation. &quot;It's a long, drawn-out process,&quot; says a World Bank representative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for criticism frequently levelled at the bank for its financial leverage, Erwin countered: &quot;First, we're confident that they're such a small part of our economic activity, their influence is negligible; second, we've put in place policies designed to prevent the detrimental effects that some of their projects might actually have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts believe the bank is not all it's cracked up to be: &quot;Scratch beneath the surface of some of the advice they offer, and take a closer look at the projects they run, and the faults are obvious,&quot; says one commentator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Erwin is used to such accusations. &quot;People become very emotional about the bank; in some cases their criticisms are very understandable because the bank's programmes have occasionally misfired. But we often use World Bank expertise and feel sufficiently experienced not to be threatened.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In examining the Francois Pienaar debacle it must be understood at the outset that South African rugby is, and always has been, reliant on the FU factor. It is an overtly arrogant mindset based on the patronising idea that players are not assets but merely disposable units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The axing of Pienaar - along with several other decisions of late - have highlighted this entrenched iconoclasm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere was this more evident among the sea of allegations, acusations, half-truths and innuendo which has all but swamped the facts of the issue, than in coach Andre Markgraaff's reading of a question on a somewhat insipid TV panel discussion this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What, the coach was asked, about the 43- million South Africans Pienaar dedicated the World Cup victory to last June. In his reply lay all that is wrong with the game right now. Markgraaf - interestingly now dubbed Saddam Hussein by the players - pointed to the adverse reaction which greeted the 32- 15 trouncing of the Springboks by Will Carling's England side at Loftus Versveld and the subsequent euphoria which followed the home side's revenge in the 27-9 victory at Newlands the following weekend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markgraaff had missed the point entirely and brought the FU factor squarely into play. It is not about the bums already in the seats, but about the bums which haven't got there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public hanging of a national hero impacts not just on the game, but on the nation. The good men like Pienaar, Kitch Christie and Morne du Plessis did for the game and the spirit they helped engender among the non-rugby playing public canot be underestimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was then a feeling that this was truly a national game and not a pastime that was the sole preserve of the white Afrikaner. To have achieved this change in perceptions in such a short space of time was remarkable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To have gone as far down the road to the destruction of this perception as quickly as the South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) has managed to do is a tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a lack of the bigger picture. Just think of the negative feelings raised in Soweto, Gugulethu and Mndantsane over the selection of Henry Tromp .  .. not to mention the trauma to the former felon himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stop for a moment and examine the reaction to the axing of James Small and the schoolmasterly timbre of the rapprochement, with Markgraaff taking the line that now that the massivley talented winger had taken his cuts and done his lines he could resume his seat at the back of the class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither of these aberrations came close to the dismissal of Pienaar though.  The subsequent resignations of Transvaal's Ray Mordt as a national selector and Natal's Keith Parkinson as a member of the Sarfu executive - and admittedly he was equally furious about the ignoring of Jeremy Thompson and Steve Atherton - were an indicator of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the Pienaar axing Mordt summed it up better than anyone else.  &quot;The coach gets what he wants,&quot; was his cryptic comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while it would be criminal to put words into Mordt's mouth, it must be added that the coach will probably get what he deserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markgraaff has continued to talk about a &quot;vision for the future&quot; and his &quot; game plan&quot; during his somewhat mediocre reign as the pilot of the listing Springbok ship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much has been made of the selection of the ageing Griqua flanker Theo Oosthuizen - some four years senior to Pienaar - as the fifth flanker on the 10-match tour of South America and Europe which starts next month as an example of this coaching vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much, too, has been said about Markgraaff's thinking that one tighthead in a battery of five props is sufficient to take on the power of the Pumas and the forcefulness of the French. Marius Hurter may well grow into the prop the coach believes he will, but his limitations were graphically exposed by the All Blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been some even more surprising vision by Markgraaff in other areas, given that he does not seem to believe Pienaar has had enough match exposure since coming back from injury in the Newlands Test against the New Zealanders - an injury, incidentally, about which the axed skipper is still awaiting an inquiry into his health and fitness from offialdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard to understand that if form and match fitness are the criteria, why Christiaan Scholtz, who has still to play a full provincial game after injury, is included. Scholtz is a fine player, but can Markgraaff judge his fitness by visionary means? One wonders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind it all stands the looming shadow of the enigmatic Louis Luyt. The Sarfu supremo has managed to do so much good for the game despite the rancorous clamour of detractors who would have him out of the game altogether.  But the ego of the man and his adherence to the FU factor as a guiding principle can also not be ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is no secret that Luyt was unhappy about Pienaar's pivotal role in the onset of the professional era, his part in the Kerry Packer affair and his spokesmanship for the players on contractual matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luyt , it must be remembered, never ever forgets a real or perceived besting. His lionisation of Pienaar at this sad point in history has the sound of just so much cant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also little of a covert nature about the differences of opinion between Pienaar, who has always led with grit and spontaneity on the field, and Markgraaff who is seemingly one of those admirers of the the idea that if Plan A fails, use Plan A again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the coach's game plan, the less said the better. Solitary wins against an outgunned Fijian side, Australia at home and one in five against New Zealand do not speak legions for a depth of planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither does the fact that it took the coach fully five Tests - and in his defence the injury to Johan Ackermann did not help - to sort out the lineouts, a facet of the game where he laboured himself in his playing days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man one has to feel equally sorry for is Gary Teichmann, who drops the caretaker role he assumed through Pienaar's injury and becomes captain in his own right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teichmann is a fine player and a proven leader. He has, in the few times he has worn the coveted colours of his country, played his heart out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is stuck in the middle of a mess that is not of his making and surely deserves all the support he can get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But again, it must be emphasised that there is far more to the axing of Pienaar than the seemingly simple business of playing rugby at international level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sadness of it all is that through the mists of the FU factor, no one in charge seems to be able to see this. Will Madiba ever apear in public again in a green and gold jersey with the proud No 6 on his back? Somehow one doubts this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do all the shenanigans and public relations fiascos provide a good launching pad for a well-thought-out development programme that has done the logical thing and fished where the fish are? We shall have to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a question that has still to be answered in many communities in this country. Given the option of giving one's son a cricket bat with the possibility of playing under the administration of Krish Macherdhuj and Ali Bacher and the captaincy of Hansie Cronje, or a golf club or tennis racket and the excitement of individual effort, would the investment in the possibility of wearing a Springbok jersey be the option followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right now there can be only one answer on this score. FU.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Zaire's soccer team is as elusive, enigmatic and potentially dangerous as the animal they claim as their mascot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Leopards will be in town on November 9 to play South Africa at Soccer City in Johannesburg at the start of the African qualifying campaign for the World Cup finals in France in 1998, and bring with them a reputation for both the brilliant and absurd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The over-riding memory of Zaire, wearing faded green shirts with the screen- printed head of a leopard emblazoned on the chest, is still of the World Cup in West Germany in 1974, when they were the first country from sub-Saharan African to make an appearance in the finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was an almost comical performance as abundant defensive errors cost them dear and they went home goalless and having conceded 14 goals in just three games, including a 9- 0 drubbing by Yugoslavia that remains a World Cup finals record and is likely never to be broken.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is distressing for Zairean football that their international image remains clouded by that farcical folly, but they have done nothing since to come anywhere near to changing those perceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A period of dominance in African football in the early 1970s, and occasional threats of potential, is as much as Zaire have offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, it is a country that remains a sleeping giant in world football, given an abundant pool of resources and limitless potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire are one of just a handful of African countries who could choose a national starting 11 made up solely of players from the leading leagues of Europe, and who have the ability to call upon more than 40 foreign-based players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have, however, been constricted by that all-too-pervasive African football malaise - lack of money and a corrupt administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The large posse of foreign-based players means any effective training and preparation Zaire seek to achieve costs a great deal of money in airfares and player payments. In much the same way that it costs a fortune to put together a decent South African team these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike South Africa, Zaire is bankrupt, there is no money in the state coffers and certainly nothing for sport - save for when the country's leader, Mobutu Sese Seko, needs a little populist pep-up which a successful football team always seems to engender in a beleaguered populace keen for a respite from the trauma of day-to-day living under despots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why, for the last six years, we have seen the incredible situation in which Zaire have secured qualification for the biennial finals of the African Nations Cup by using a set of mostly domestically based players, only for the whole team to change and be reinforced by their foreign legion when it comes time to play the finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the qualifying tournament for the last Nations Cup finals in South Africa, Zaire used a total of 42 players in their seven qualifying matches, only 16 of them from their considerable contingent in Europe. And their appearances were sparing as the federation could afford to bring no more than four players from Europe per game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when they got to South Africa, only nine of the 22-man squad were drawn from Zairean clubs, Mobutu having put his hand in his pocket for once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the money was brought in a briefcase by the sports minister, who was then rumoured to have gone house-hunting in Durban before paying his players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It led to a mini-revolt, with some extraordinary scenes in the team's hotel lobby, that saw the coach storm out after just one match at the Nations Cup finals, one player fly home to Germany and the rest sulk through a series of mediocre performances which saw the Zaireans go no further than the quarter- finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matters were made worse by the selection of three players, whose knowledge of the language, tradition and customs of their country was restricted to childhood memory and the parlours of their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One player, striker Felix-Michel Ngonge, was born of Zairean parents in the former colonial power Belgium and had never been anywhere near Africa before.  He flew directly from Europe to Durban before the tournament started, where he and several others from Europe kicked their heels for a week while awaiting the rest of the team, and then went straight back to Belgium with one cap under his belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michel Dinzey, born of a Zairean father and German mother, could not speak Lingala, Swahili or French - the languages of the country - and was thus unable to communicate with his teammates. He cut a lone figure during the tournament before going home early with the coach Mushin Ertugal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other orphan was Roger Hitoto, a French first division player with Lille, who was born in Kinshasa but moved to France with his parents at the age of three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amazingly, all three have got over the trauma of soccer the Zairean way to still be in contention for team selection for the match against South Africa.  Under new coach Muntumbile Santos, Zaire scored seven goals in their two World Cup preliminary round matches against Mauritius in June, but were recently held to a goalless draw by George Weah and his Liberian compatriots in a qualifying game for the 1998 African Nations Cup finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santos is back in charge after serving a six-month suspension for fielding an over- age player in an under-23 match against Congo, which led to Zaire being kicked out of the All-African Games soccer competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former foreign-based international himself, Santos knows both sides of the coin and has been able to attempt something of a warm-up for the match against South Africa with a recent friendly match in Morocco. But the game ended in suitable Zairean style - most of their players arrived just hours before kick-off and they lost 7-0.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But none of this ludicrousness should lull South Africa into a sense of complacency. Zaire have the potential to play a mean game of football and there is no better stimulant than the World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have a side with strength in defence, bite in midfield where captain Kaboya Mukanya remains one of the unsung heroes of African football, and plenty of talent upfront, not least their new goalscoring sensation Mbullua Ntondelua.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be a very serious threat to South Africa's World Cup aspirations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is apposite, with the high-profile Champions Tournament taking the limelight this weekend at a venue which has caused the Sandton kugels to make a detour to the up- market shops around Sandton Square, to contrast this with the other end of the tennis spectrum and an event which happened last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out at the Bapedi Hall complex, a venue that could be a million light years away from the boutiques and coffee shops of the northern suburbs, a handful of dedicated players fought out the Soweto Games tennis title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Sandton Square, the legends of the game play on one specially designed and purpose- laid court, beneath the latest of this country's luxury hotels.  At the hugely more modest Bapedi Hall, there is the advantage of eight courts.  But, as in the Champions Tournament, only one was used.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The in-built differences in the two tournaments are apparent to even the most casual observer. But that must register as an example of the dichotomy of South African sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both events carried the same sponsor. Both are equally important to the game for its very survival and future healthy growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gordon Forbes, who heads the new-look South African Tennis Association, has rightly pointed to the inter-dependence of these two poles in the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to have the big stars to attract the interest of the youngsters,&quot; is the very sensible and logical way Forbes puts it. Quite so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Forbes did not say, but what is also equally evident, is that there has to be a generation of financial resources to support tournaments like the one which was part of the Soweto Games. There also have to be the big time tournaments to fund the development of the game which is so vital. Players like young Geoff Coetzee will doubtless continue to come through a system loaded against the underprivileged areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then not everyone is going to do what the young man from the far reaches of the northern Cape did, and fashion himself a racquet out of a discarded crate and practise on his own. That takes a special type of dedication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more normal progression is the one which must be followed; engender the interest, draw the youngsters close, coach them and then help them progress into tournament play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly enough, this is roughly parallel to the route Johan Kriek, second seed for the golden oldies tournament, followed. And he is still the only South African player with a Grand Slam title to his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And equally interesting is the fact that this route - as Forbes and the sponsors understand - begins at venues like Bapedi Hall.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The pervading national atmosphere on the three occasions that South Africa's cricketers have visited India has been characterised by an uncommon free-wheeling of spirit. A significant percentage of India's population is (as is the general perception) fixated with the game and the fortunes of the Indian team, on and off the field. But South Africans may not be aware of just how the spirit changes when they are playing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent one-off Test victory over Australia was a tense affair that saw the crowd at the Kotla ground in New Delhi more inclined to bite their nails than sing and dance. The Australians have built quite a reputation for themselves over the last two years and many local scribes and pundits declared unashamedly that they were the best team in the world after a Test series victory in the West Indies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India's seven-wicket victory, in Sachin Tendulkar's debut Test as captain, was greeted with something closer to relief than celebration but, more importantly, the pleasure was a kind of cricketing &quot;premature ejaculation&quot; because there is only the one match. Test cricket, in this most traditional of environments, must be decided over at least three encounters to proclaim a real winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clashes with Pakistan are inevitably closer to war than sport while Sri Lanka, despite their newfound status as world one-day champions, may still be regarded as a precocious younger brother for many years to come. Some epic encounters against the West Indians, beginning in the early and middle 1970s, still excite animated tea-room chatter among the country's older fans, but even they do not come with quite the gloss and glitter that the South Africans do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the face of it, it doesn't make sense. The record of competition between the two nations is hardly something for the game's historians to get their teeth into and, in fact, Indians have been on the receiving end more often than not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason, actually, can be simply traced. Whatever the level of emotion generated in South Africa by Clive Rice's 1991 apartheid- busting 10-day tour, it is unlikely to match the depth of feeling here. The nation still has the warm feeling of a good Samaritan who was there to hold his best friend's hand as he went through cold turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However true it may be, Indians believe they played a crucial part in helping South Africa on the road to recovery after a terrible illness and, as such, they are able to claim a part of the current Hansie Cronje-Bob Woolmer inspired success. If it sounds strange, then it probably is. But it's true Woolmer actually has a place in many Indians' hearts after touring with Tony Greig's England team in the 1970s, but neither he nor the captain are the crowd's favourites. Cronje might have had a better chance were it not for his name which Indians find impossible - Hanisee Krunjee is about as good as it gets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly five years ago the garlands of flowers and never-ending flow of goodwill overshadowed much of what happened on the field. Although Rice endeared himself as a gruff old general and Peter Kirsten was, at last, able to display his craft (along with Adrian Kuiper in the third game at Eden Gardens in front of 100 000 people), the Indians were not supplied with new South African &quot;greats&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They still tended to talk about Ali Bacher, the Pollocks, Jackie McGlew, and Mike Procter. And Eddie Barlow, actually. In fact, Barry Richards too ...  But the second trip, for the Hero Cup, was very different. Allan Donald, after his incredible 5-28 in 1991, was an easy favourite for the crowds. If there is one thing that Indians have never had, and nearly worship as a result, it is great fast bowlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the great Kapil Dev was only genuinely quick for a couple of his 12 years at the top. Donald is admired from afar. Because of his fearsome pace he is admired by Indian children much as a lion is in a zoo. I have seen young boys approach him with an autograph book in hand much as Roman gladiators must have felt entering the Colisseum for a fight to the death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonty Rhodes, however, is different. Like Donald, Indians admire him because he is something they have seldom seen and never had. You see, in India you simply never dive. Outfields are barren, often grassless and frequently sprinkled with rusty bottle tops, bits of broken bottle and stones.  And yet Rhodes seems unperturbed. Although it is little wonder that India cannot produce a Rhodes of their own, it is still breathtaking to watch him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt his attitude to life and cricket remains constant wherever he is in the world, but here in India, with a population well in excess of 1 000- million, almost everyone seems to have had (or knows someone who has had) some personal contact with the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, my own 11 year-old nephew (who admittedly had the benefit of a very good seat in the grandstand) was rewarded with an autograph after Rhodes's world record- breaking five catches against the West Indies in Bombay two-and-a-half years ago. He waited for over half an hour to get the signature and still remembers the complaints of Rhodes's team mates who were being kept waiting in the team bus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This third team has lost none of it's attraction for Indians. At their first practice, at a nondescript gymkhana club ground in Hyderabad on Tuesday, four or five thousand young men resembled caged refugees as they clung to the outside of the chicken wire fence enclosing the playing field. If Rhodes could have signed an autograph through the fence, he probably would ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of two months the tourists will be known to the Indians as never before. Maybe some of the younger players, too, will become heroes. We are led to believe that Derek Crookes and Herschelle Gibbs are exciting prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the man that may intrigue more than any other is Pat Symcox. It is not clear whether he will adapt better than any other to India, or not at all. He played the role of the irritated, moody old seargeant major to perfection on Tuesday and succeeded in scowling at enough autograph-seeking children to have filled a cricket field, chest to chest. But there are a lot of children in India ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Once quite long ago, in a land not so far away, there lived a young woman called Gcina Mhlophe. She was a domestic worker in the city.  She scrubbed floors and ironed clothes and looked after four tumbling children, all at the same time. One day she decided to keep them quiet by telling a story about Nanabuhlele the big monster of many colours that lives in the water. Gcina didn't know if the children would like her African tales, but soon they were shouting, &quot;Tell us another, Tina!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The years passed, Gcina became a famous actress and went overseas. Then she decided to become a full-time storyteller, one thing led to another (as it does in stories) and soon there was a group of storytellers called Zanendaba who visited schools and community centres all over the land. Last week they held a festival in Johannesburg to celebrate the power of tales.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Aboriginal storyteller and activist, Maureen Watson: &quot;Stories are like houses, you can change the furniture around, paint them different colours, but the shape remains the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are sitting in the coffee shop at Museum Africa, where Zanendaba's annual festival is in full swing. For three days busloads of children and the occasional teacher have crammed the auditorium to watch Gcina Mhlophe and her eight-woman team in action. Watson is this year's international guest. Now a great-grandmother, she has been telling stories since she was four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We lived in a bark hut by the river and Mum was always having a baby - or recovering from the last one. As the eldest child I soon discovered that storytelling stopped the little ones crying,&quot; she recalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Watson, traditional stories are a way of &quot;keeping track of the ancestors&quot;. They teach respect and remind people of universal laws. In a country where Aborigines represent just 2% of the total population, people like Watson provide a vital link with an endangered culture. And her tales are for white Australians too. &quot;The people who arrived in the last 200 years have their roots in foreign soil,&quot; she says. &quot;They need to learn our stories so they can connect up to our land and stop destroying it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a burst of laughter from the auditorium. Watson gets to her feet: &quot; Let's go in. I don't want to miss anything.&quot; Inside, Zanendaba's Nana Mthimkhulu is telling a Malawian version of Little Red Riding Hood. She's got to the bit where the innocent heroine (en route to Grandma) has been kidnapped by a monster and put into a sack. Not one to give up easily, the heroine starts to sing. The monster puts down the sack and exclaims: &quot;Radio FM fundamental!&quot; He has turned into a jive-talking gangster from the townships and the kids love it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is Zanendaba's magic: to take an old story and repaint it with colours that are fresh and glowing. When Mhlophe tells how Hare and Dog fall in love with &quot;clever, clean&quot; Pig, it becomes a tale of teenage angst and eternal triangles. When Elizabeth Mathebula tells an Inuit creation myth, she describes how muskrat swims down to the centre of the earth, &quot;just like our Penny - you know Penny Heyns!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not every story has a happy ending. &quot;It's only the white teachers who worry about that kind of thing,&quot; says Mhlophe. &quot;The rest of us know that children see pain every day of their lives. Stories - old and new - help us connect with real things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nana Mthimkhulu agrees. She remembers the workshop where a Standard 10 girl told the story of her father's death. &quot;She was crying and we asked her whether she needed to stop,&quot; recalls Mthimkhulu. &quot;But she just said: 'I haven't finished my story yet.' Afterwards we discovered that she'd never spoken of this tragedy before. She was using the story to heal herself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Story creation is a major aspect of Zanendaba's work. The methodology is simple: children learn by doing. Some teachers describe this as &quot;unorthodox&quot;.  For &quot;unorthodox&quot; read &quot;threatening&quot;, especially in the context of an authoritarian school system. But anyone who has watched a Zanendaba workshop knows that the level of concentration is intense - even with children who claim they can't tell stories. There is something ritualistic about it too.  The circle, the special Zanendaba hand- clasp. Mhlophe remembers how it began:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One boy said to me, 'Do you know where the heart of the hand is? It's here where the thumb meets the palm.' Well, that's how we hold hands now in workshops. My heart touches your heart. I hold you and transfer my inspiration to you - and you do the same for the next person.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - As at 18 October, 18 cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever have been reported of which 11 were fatal in the Booue region. Two patients have recovered and five are still under treatment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the four new cases were in children who had been in close contact with previously registered cases. Four patients are currently under treatment and two are recovering. A further 111 contacts have been identified. Most (100) are in the Ogooue-Ivindo Province but a few have been reported Moyen Oogoue, Latoursville, Oogoue Lolo and Libreville situated between 300 and 500 km from Booue. The Ministry of Health has taken precautions to assure that these contacts are under strict surveillance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An isolation ward has been prepared in Booue Hospital and samples for laboratory investigation have been collected from patients and close contacts.  An education and information campaign for health workers has been undertaken in regions where the epidemic has occurred and in bordering areas where there have been no reports of suspected cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An International Committee for Technical and Scientific Coordination was established in Gabon with the collaboration of the WHO following the announcement of an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in the Booue region. It includes experts from the Gabonese Ministry of Health, the International Medical Research Centre in Franceville, Gabon, Cooperation Francaise and WHO.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva (ICRC) - South Kivu and the border areas of Zaire are the scene of growing violence, and the current escalation in warlike rhetoric is fuelling hatred, intolerance and a trend towards exclusion. Unruly behaviour on the part of those bearing weapons, excesses and abuses, including an incident involving a medical facility, are creating a climate of fear and dangerously increasing tension in this troubled area, rife with unresolved and highly explosive political issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is concerned to note that this radical turn of events is linked to the question of ethnic identity, which has already caused large-scale disaster in the Great Lakes region. The ICRC consequently calls on all the parties concerned to ensure that moderation and restraint prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC moreover wants to remind all those bearing arms and military and political leaders of the basic and universally recognized rules that demand respect for civilians, the wounded and captured combatants, as well as for the staff of humanitarian organizations and of the ICRC in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC is currently sending medical personnel and the equipment required to set up a surgical unit at the Uvira hospital. It also plans to extend its activities in aid of all the victims, in accordance with its principles of neutrality and impartiality, and needs the support of all involved if its staff are to be able to work and travel throughout the area in safety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Text of a fax from Kumar Rupesinghe, the secretary-general of International Alert (Fax:44 171 793 7975; Tel: +44 171 793 8383) on the situation on Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in eastern Zaire has worsened considerably over the past month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attached report from one of our Field Officers demonstrates how explosive the current position is and the dangers of further degradation.  There is a clear need for the international community to take swift action to prevent further fighting and potential regional escalation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Developments in the last 48 hours</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the receipt of the report there have been further important developments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean Prime Minister has acknowledged at a press conference that the Banyamulenge are Zairean citizens and it is reported that President Mobutu has made a similar declaration. The political significance of these statements is as yet unclear. Frankly, the extent to which the writ of central government actually runs in the province of Kivu is extremely uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite such reported declarations, the people and administrations of north and south Kivu are saying they are ready to fight the Banyamulenge at all costs. There are reports that other groups around Uvira have asked the Zairean government for arms to fight the Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears increasingly that among the key political figures in Zaire who have influence are the President of the Zaire National Assembly (Anzeluni), the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Kititwa), the Minister of the Interior (Kamanda wa Kamanda), the Governor of south Kivu (Pasteur Kyembwa) and the Commissaire de Zone d'Uvira (Shweka Mutabazi). These political leaders need to make clear statements about the Banyamulenge right to nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conclusion, may I draw your attention to the recommendations appended to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TOUR REPORT - KIVU, ZAIRE (8-12 October) by Karen Twining of International Alert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Purpose of visit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. To find out more about the Banyamulenge crisis in South Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. To make contact with NGOs/civil society working in Eastern Zaire on conflict-related issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Introduction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following discussions in London on 25/9/96 about the Banyamulenge crisis and its implications for regional stability, I arranged to travel to South Kivu in Eastern Zaire with Hassan Ba of Synergy Africa and a representative from IRED/PREFED/PRECOPA. We flew from Kigali to Goma and took an internal flight to Bukavu. On return we spent a night in Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presence of the Rwandese refugees and the escalating conflict in South Kivu have contributed to deteriorating security. The situation in South Kivu is tense and explosive. We arrived to the sound of gun-shots and the sight of people fleeing from the army, who were looting to express their anger at the killing of a colonel and seven soldiers by the Banyamulenge. Our movements were restricted by the prevailing insecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this context, we were able to meet with different Bukavu NGO leaders and local journalists, but were not able to travel to the main conflict zone.  Hassan Ba met the Vice Governor (since suspended) to discuss the Toure diplomatic initiative. In Kigali we maintained contact with a Banyamulenge leader, and members of the Rwandan Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As expected in any conflict situation views are highly polarised and inconsistent. I have therefore tried to present the public perspectives of individuals representing different stake-holder groups to give a flavour of their discourse, while being aware that the reality is far more complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quick chronology</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please also refer to the IRIN Briefing: The Conflict in South Kivu, Zaire and its Regional Implications, 7 October 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key dates include:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Positions and perspectives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NB. Please note that the following perspectives represent summaries of common views expressed to us by different stake-holders within the last week and are not opinions or judgements of mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within certain groups, (particularly South Kivu Civil Society), there was more nuance and divergence of opinion, but these were the dominant sentiments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Views expressed by Banyamulenge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge are fighting for their right to Zairois citizenship and to live peacefully with their neighbours and nothing else. They are discriminated against on the basis of language and morphology and now are being massacred by GOZ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge left Rwanda for Zaire at the end of the 18th century: some have been in Zaire for over 10 generations, a fact corroborated by written sources and oral history. During the 1965 Mulele rebellion, Mobutu armed the Banyamulenge to fight against the rebels. There have been Banyamulenge MPs, Chiefs and very senior civil servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOZ exerted maximum harassment to force the Banyamulenge to flee to Rwanda.  This has now become wholesale massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lemera Hospital attack (6 October) was a response to a number of incidents in which Banyamulenge have been tortured and killed (eg 49 men killed by burning tyre necklaces at Kamanola, 5 men killed at Uvira, 5 priests at Luberizi, 202 at Bibokoboko, 80 at Itombwe and others). The hospital was targeted to obtain drugs and to block the road to the High Plateau. Prior to the Lemera Hospital attack the Banyamulenge had not touched any civilians and will not attack without provocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banyamulenge took up arms as a last resort, after the arrival of the 1994 refugees and increasing threats from the Zairois authorities and politicians.  Their arms were bought from several Zaire Army Colonels and from the Interahamwe ($130 pre 1996, now $200 for an AK47). 50 Banyamulenge Officers deserted the Military Training College at Kananga and have trained their troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RPF/GOR have not provided arms to Banyamulenge. Their support is restricted to accepting refugees and informing the international community about their plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of South Kivu civil society accept that Banyamulenge has right to citizenship, due to economic jealousy and hypocrisy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge are willing to consider anything that will bring about peace, and they are ready to stop fighting immediately and lay down arms in exchange for nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Views expressed by South Kivu Civil Society/NGOs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge are rebels, saboteurs and disloyal serpents, who have abused Zairois hospitality and are making false claims to nationality and land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandese both Tutsi and Hutu have brought nothing but trouble to Kivu and should all be returned to Rwanda, where they come from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banyamulenge are the aggressors who have been attacking innocent civilians.  (No acknowledgement of harassment and massacres of Banyamulenge).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kagame is using the Banyamulenge to destabilise Zaire and consolidate Tutsiland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community have abandoned Zaire and favour Rwandese Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people of South Kivu are ready to take up arms to fight against the Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now too late for a peaceful solution or for the Banyamulenge to be able to stay in Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Views expressed by South Kivu Politicians (Taken from Declarations of the South Kivu Group of MPs dated 18 &amp; 27 September 1996)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge problem is part of an international conspiracy to support the expansionist ambitions of Rwanda and Burundi to create a Hima Empire.  Rwandese Tutsis started arriving in Zaire only since 1934 and have no right to Zairois nationality. There is no record of any 'Banyamulenge' ethnic group in colonial times: the name was fabricated by pretenders to citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge, along with other Tutsis resident in Zaire, left in large numbers to join the RPF and to live in Rwanda.  They have been supported by Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Somalia and Ethiopia to conquer South and North Kivu, and destabilise Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOZ should apply the Nationality Law rigorously, expel all people of Rwandese and Burundi origin and relieve them of public and political office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPs support the efforts of the local people to defend their territory and demand the expulsion of NGOs involved in destabilising the region (Oxfam, CARE, ICRC, UNHCR etc).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Views expressed by South Kivu Vice-Governor (suspended on 11 October)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda has declared war on Zaire. GOZ has made efforts to discuss situation with GOR but they have refused dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banyamulenge have 6 days to leave the High Plateau ('couloir humanitaire') or be identified with the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Views expressed by Rwandan Government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banyamulenge are Zairois citizens who have the right to stay in Zaire. They are victims of genocide, carried out by the Zairian army with the help of the ex-FAR and the Interahamwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Rwanda has no claim to Zairois territory and is bound by the 1963 OAU Declaration respecting colonial boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the military front, GOR will not cross the border but it will defend its own territory. GOR cannot sit and watch the Banyamulenge being massacred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Banyamulenge return to Rwanda, they should bring their land with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President said Rwanda can receive Banyamulenge women and children but the men should go and fight for their rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOZ is trying to destabilise Rwanda in order to distract attention away from its own internal crises and leadership vacuum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French Government are behind the attempts to destabilise Rwanda. The mercenary Bob Denard is now in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOR wants a diplomatic solution to convince GOZ to stop the killings and establish the claims to nationality of the Banyamulenge. They will approach the Belgians, British and Germans, who were involved in the Brussels Convention of 1910 to press for a Security Council resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reported statement by Aldo Ajello, EU special representative for Great Lakes region The situation of the Banyamulenge is potentially more serious than Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our Conclusions 1. The Banyamulenge crisis in south Kivu has serious implications for regional stability and extends far beyond the quest for nationality rights by the Banyamulenge, who are likely to be the victims of larger political interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Events of the past few months in South Kivu appear to repeat the flight of Tutsis from Masisi and Rutshuru in 1995-6 with the difference being that the Banyamulenge have been preparing themselves to fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Currently the Banyamulenge are well-armed and occupy a strategic position on the Haut Plateau, a terrain they know well. It is reported that they are receiving support from the RPF, although this is denied by both parties. Their advantages over the FAZ (Zaire Army Forces) from outside the region will not last long if other local groups (Babembe, Barega Bafulero, Bashi) decide to take up arms against the Banyamulenge. This would result in massive bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The ex-FAR/Interahamwe appear to be involved in the killings of the Banyamulenge, in league with FAZ and the local people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The conflict in South Kivu cannot be resolved without addressing the refugee problem. Rwanda will not feel safe with armed refugees on its borders, and the presence of CNDD headquarters in Uvira adds to the perceived threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The Banyamulenge's right to Zairoise nationality must be sorted out by legal means, rather than by fighting. They are ready to negotiate. However the strong anti-Tutsi feelings prevalent in Eastern Zaire have been exacerbated by the one-sided accounts of atrocities committed by the Banyamulenge, making a peaceful solution more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The international community must put pressure on the Zaire Government to recognise the nationality rights of the Banyamulenge and stop the blood-shed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our Recommendations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The UN security council should study the situation in Kivu and request the government of Zaire to suspend immediately any action of its forces against Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Equally, the security council should request the Rwandan government to refrain from any action that could inflame the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The UN and the OAU should urgently convene a summit between GOZ and GOR to formulate concrete plans to deal adequately with the Banyamulenge crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. UNHCR should co-ordinate safe passage and organise reception if evacuation is the only immediate way of saving life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Escorts should monitor and protect the movement of Banyamulenge from eastern Zaire; OAU and other forces should be prepared to mobilise immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. All concerned NGOs should:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a. make every effort to inform and lobby the international community about the current situation in south Kivu in order to prevent escalation of the war and widespread bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b. encourage and provide support to a diplomatic initiative to resolve the problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c. consider different ways of working with civil society in south Kivu to change the strong anti-Tutsi sentiments and consolidate a peace process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Member states of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) started meeting Monday to examine details for the creation of a common external tariff for the subregion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They want, within 10 years, to establish this tariff on goods imported into the states from third countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMESA, whose majority members have already reduced tariffs by 70 percent and 80 percent, intends to reduce to zero all tariffs and other charges of equivalent effect by the year 2,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also analyze the tariff structure of COMESA member states. Also under review will be the impact of the common external tariffs on the revenues, industrialization, production and employment of the member states and COMESA trade with third countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the opening of the first workshop of experts to consider the common external tariff, COMESA Secretary-General Bingu Mutharika said that the common tariff was indispensable to the development of industry and to economic integration of the grouping's 23 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the tariff would enable industry to develop and member states to produce more competitive goods at competitive prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intra-COMESA trade, he added, had been growing at an average annual rate of 10.1 percent, but COMESA's trade with third countries had been growing at an annual average rate of 7.2 percent only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All trade liberalization, trade development and trade promotion measures would yield no results if no measures were undertaken to facilitate trade in the region,&quot; Mutharika said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries represented at the meeting are Angola, Burundi, Comoros, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe's cellular mobile telephone service contract between the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) and Siemens International of Germany is expected to be signed in Harare on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siemens won in September the 20-million U.S. dollar tender, whose introduction was marred by controversy early 1996, when a tender awarded by PTC to Ericsson of Sweden was revoked by government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cellular tender is probably the longest tender saga in the country's history. It prompted the intervention of President Robert Mugabe who instructed that it should be re-tendered because the PTC had violated the tender board regulations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the contract, Siemens is expected to install network with an initial capacity of 20,000 lines covering Harare and Bulawayo, within five months after it becomes effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been given a total of nine months to cover Masvingo, Gweru, Mutare, Nyanga, Kariba, Victoria Falls, Hwange and the Harare-Bulawayo highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PTC Deputy Postmaster-General in charge of cellular mobile telephone services, Joshua Chideme, said on Monday that the line capacity could go up to 70,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was hoped that the contract would become effective early 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siemens installed a system designed to cater for 2,000 consumers during the September world solar summit. The same units would also be hired out during the forthcoming group of 15 (G-15) meeting, to be held in Zimbabwe in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chideme said the PTC would only be able to provide a commercial service for the 2,000 units when the proposed tariffs have been gazetted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment, he said, the PTC was charging those people who received the cellular telephones during the summit the same tariffs for normal telephone services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike in some countries, Zimbabwe would not be charging the consumer for receiving a call on a cellular telephone, but would only charge a &quot;roaming&quot; tariff when the person receives a call when abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chideme said the 2,000 lines were already over-subscribed. &quot;The response has been overwhelming. Once the tariffs are gazetted, all 2,000 lines will be taken away and the 20,000 is also over-subscribed,&quot; Chideme said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Customers wanting the cellular service will be connected onto the network by three indigenous service providers, which were appointed by PTC. The three are Cosmo cellular, CST Cellular and Zellco cellular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to providing the mobile sets, the three will offer customers operating instructions, the system for mobile communication (SIM) cards which give a subscriber an identity, tariff packages and coverage maps, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to comment on the affordability of the cellular telephone, Chideme said: &quot;It's a service. As you know, even the normal telephone service is not affordable to 80 percent of Zimbabweans because of the income levels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prices of the hand sets are expected to range from 400 U.S. dollars to 1,000 U.S. dollars and this excludes the price of the Sim Card, which is expected to cost at least 25 U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa has given its official backing to the current peace process in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a meeting in Cape Town Sunday with former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Perez, South African President Nelson Mandela pledged his support for the peace negotiations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela said he would soon be visiting the Middle East &quot;as a peace messenger,&quot; but said he would not interfere in the internal affairs of the countries of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said he would share the South African experience with them. He said that the Middle East would have to work out solutions to its problems for itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Outsiders can only play a role to strengthen the peace process,&quot; He said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initiation of the Middle East peace process, he said, had brought a powerful message of hope. But like all peace-loving people throughout the world, he added, &quot;we are extremely concerned by the apparent impasse&quot; regarding the implementation of the accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our own humble experience has taught us that such accords are delicate matters,&quot; he said, &quot;and integrity in their implementation, and mutual consent where a review of their content may seem necessary, are as important as the substance of the agreements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accepting a peace award at an International Leadership Reunion dinner Sunday, Mandela said that if South Africa had become a symbol of the peace process, it was due to the people of the country themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is they who are honored by the award which you have bestowed upon me,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On their behalf,&quot; he said, &quot;I humbly accept it in the fervent hope that what we have achieved as a nation will in some small way serve as a powerful force of example to our continent, and further afield.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KUMASI, Ghana (PANA) - Ghana's World Bank-sponsored Urban Environmental Sanitation Project (Urban Four), to cover five major towns, is estimated to cost 89.3 million U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major components of the project -- to cover the cities of Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Tema and Tamale -- are storm drainage, sanitation, solid waste, upgrading of low-income urban areas and capacity building to promote productivity and raise living standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is especially designed for lower-income people by improving drainage, sanitation and solid waste services, while it helps to build up the capacity of the metropolitan and municipal assemblies to manage environmental sanitation services.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project will help establish better institutional and financing mechanisms and more effective policy frameworks so that improvements are sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report on the project, to be implemented over a six-year period from September 1996 to the year 2002, says it is being funded with International Development Association (IDA) credit of 71 million dollars, payable in 40 years with a 10-year grace period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Ghana will contribute 8.9 million dollars towards the project, while the metropolitan and municipal assemblies, which are the beneficiaries, would contribute about 5.3 million dollars, representing their shares of community upgrading works, sanitation facilities and solid waste collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-financing of about 3.4 million dollars has been secured from the Nordic Development Fund, while the Netherlands Government would contribute about 600, 000 dollars towards a training programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says the focus of the storm drainage component is to alleviate flooding in built-up urban areas and the highest priority interventions have been selected in Accra, Kumasi and Sekondi-Takoradi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Accra, approximately seven kilometers (4.3 miles) of the city's primary drainage channel, the Odaw, from the Abossey Okai road to the Motorway extension would be dredged and reconstructed as a trapezoidal channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would significantly alleviate flooding in major industrial, commercial and residential areas in and around the city. At the same time, about 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) of secondary drains serving 13 neighborhoods will be reconstructed to alleviate flooding affecting about 20,000 people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Ghana's Interior minister, Col. E.M. Osei-Owusu has resigned, an official statement said Sunday in Accra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Jerry Rawlings has accepted Osei-Owusu's resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His resignation, effective from Nov. 1, follows the publication of an interim report by the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice of investigations into alleged illegal acquisition of assets by some public officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, last week, made adverse findings against Osei-Owusu; the minister of trade and industry, Ibrahim Adam, and Isaac Adjei-Maafo, a member on the presidential staff. But it exonerated P.V. Obeng, the presidential adviser on governmental Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement quoted Osei-Owusu as saying in letter of resignation that he intended to contest the adverse findings made against him by the commission.  He described the commission's conclusions as grossly unfair and highly disputable in the face of available evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had no alternative than to resign so he could seek justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, he said he would challenge the commission's findings &quot;in the appropriate quarters&quot; so save his family, friends and colleagues embarrassment and to clear his name, as well as protect his honor and hard- won reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed hope that the attorney-general's office would grant him the opportunity to study and comment on the report before a White Paper on the final report is issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its findings, the commission said that the allegation or suspicion that the minister's house was worth 600 million cedis (351,943.31 U.S. dollars) could not be substantiated having regard to the evidence on record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the report says the Commission made &quot;an adverse finding&quot; against Osei-Owusu in that he was &quot;unable to account&quot; for 33 million cedis in excess income from April 1993 to June 1995, a period during which the house was constructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not in a position to determine how his extra income was acquired,&quot; the report says. &quot;Neither has the minister offered any satisfactory explanation or any explanation at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, the reports says: &quot;We recommend that the minister should be made to refund to the state, the excess income of 33,023,182.48 cedis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osei-Owusu joined military government of the Provisional National Defence Council as the Ashanti regional minister. He was later promoted a cabinet minister and continued as minister of interior when Rawlings won democratic elections in 1992.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Managing Director of the influential and authoritative Daily Times of Nigeria newspaper, Peter Enahoro, has accused the U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria, Walter Carrington, of being responsible for the deterioration of relations between Washington and Abuja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, &quot;Ambassador Carrington has had his own way with his careless utterances in this country for too long. He is blamed by knowledgeable observers for personally carrying a torch for confrontation&quot;, Enahoro, who assumed office recently, said in a critical opinion piece, published by the paper this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informed observers believe that he was expressing official reaction to the embarrassing treatment of the Nigerian foreign minister, Tom Ikimi, at the New York JFK International Airport, and the recent five-nation tour by the Secretary of State, Warren Christopher that sidelined Nigeria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highly respected Nigerian journalist alleged that each time there was an apparent thaw in relations between the two countries, the ambassador and his cronies at the State Department would work out another strategy to heighten the tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article, published on Oct. 15, fell short of calling Ambassador Carrington a loverboy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enahoro attuned that shortly on arrival in Nigeria, the ambassador got himself hooked to a Nigerian belle, whom he later married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Carrington is now being accused of abusing the specific privilege he bestowed on himself by virtue of his marrying a Nigerian. &quot; Perhaps the ambassador feels he had earned the right to interfere rudely in our affairs because he has availed himself of a wife from among us,&quot; the writer says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enahoro quipped: &quot;Ambassador Carrington's amazing lassitude with freely given remarks about the current political affairs of Nigeria has frequently been as unbecoming in its indignity as it had breached diplomatic politesse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Enahoro (alias Peter Pan), returned from more than 20 years in self exile in England, following Nigeria's first 1966 military coup, assumed office as chief of the DAily Times of Nigeria Plc, (the largest media empire in the country in which the government has controlling shares) last month. He is the brother of one of Nigeria's frontline politicians and former information minister under the Gowon military administration that ruled Nigeria for eight years, Anthony Enahoro, now a leading prodemocracy activist in exile in North America. The Daily Times boss accused ambassador Carrington of also abusing his position as an African American, throwing all diplomatic niceties to the wind in his efforts to fan the embers of hate in Nigeria-U.S.  relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enahoro stated that &quot;...he should also be reminded that there is a thing called sovereignty and that Nigeria places a higher value on protecting her status as an independent nation, than putting out the welcome mat for a foreign envoy's anxiety to be seen to have gone native.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article also suggested that Ambassador Carrington does not wield any clout in Washington. Enahoro said, &quot;his allies may be at the State Department and among a declining scattering of influences in the house of representatives, but they are scarcely plentiful at the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further stated that &quot;Each time they sense a thaw on the horizon, they promptly move the goal posts. Thus when Nigeria strengthened its laws against drug trafficking, Washington said they were not good enough. When Nigeria was commended by no less a body than the United Nations drug control programme for its anti-drug trafficking strictures, Washington buffed that the measures were not being applied anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enahoro said that &quot;all fair-minded persons must surely now begin to wonder what really are the reasons the administration of President Bill Clinton does not wish to restore the traditional good relations between the United States and Nigeria.&quot; He cited the recent tour of some African countries by Secretary of State Warren Christopher who spoke about imposing more sanctions on Nigeria before putting forward his country's proposal to fund an African army that excludes Nigeria, as a case in point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recollected that &quot;South Africa told him to take his case to the U.N.  Ethiopia said the idea was best handled at the level of the OAU, where of course Nigeria has considerable clout. No wonder Christopher took a swipe at Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the trouble with the Clinton African doctrine was that &quot;it equates the voguish pro-democracy campaign with a crude Americanization of the universe. Any country, any administration that resists this misinterpretation becomes a target of calumny and bullying rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enahoro recalled that for the past three years, Nigeria had not received a cent from international financial institutions because of Washington's blocking tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The longer Nigeria survives the blockade, the more vexed Clinton's washington that this country is setting a bad example for other third world countries to stand up to U.S. excesses,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happily there is little the U.S. administration can do to try to undermine the increasing consolidation of Nigeria's regional and continental power. It was balmy in the first place to imagine that you could speak of a continental African army that excludes Nigeria,&quot; Enahoro concluded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Member states of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) started meeting Monday to examine details for the creation of a common external tariff for the subregion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They want, within 10 years, to establish this tariff on goods imported into the states from third countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMESA, whose majority members have already reduced tariffs by 70 percent and 80 percent, intends to reduce to zero all tariffs and other charges of equivalent effect by the year 2,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also analyze the tariff structure of COMESA member states. Also under review will be the impact of the common external tariffs on the revenues, industrialization, production and employment of the member states and COMESA trade with third countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the opening of the first workshop of experts to consider the common external tariff, COMESA Secretary-General Bingu Mutharika said that the common tariff was indispensable to the development of industry and to economic integration of the grouping's 23 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the tariff would enable industry to develop and member states to produce more competitive goods at competitive prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intra-COMESA trade, he added, had been growing at an average annual rate of 10.1 percent, but COMESA's trade with third countries had been growing at an annual average rate of 7.2 percent only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All trade liberalization, trade development and trade promotion measures would yield no results if no measures were undertaken to facilitate trade in the region,&quot; Mutharika said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries represented at the meeting are Angola, Burundi, Comoros, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe's cellular mobile telephone service contract between the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) and Siemens International of Germany is expected to be signed in Harare on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siemens won in September the 20-million U.S. dollar tender, whose introduction was marred by controversy early 1996, when a tender awarded by PTC to Ericsson of Sweden was revoked by government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cellular tender is probably the longest tender saga in the country's history. It prompted the intervention of President Robert Mugabe who instructed that it should be re-tendered because the PTC had violated the tender board regulations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the contract, Siemens is expected to install network with an initial capacity of 20,000 lines covering Harare and Bulawayo, within five months after it becomes effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been given a total of nine months to cover Masvingo, Gweru, Mutare, Nyanga, Kariba, Victoria Falls, Hwange and the Harare-Bulawayo highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PTC Deputy Postmaster-General in charge of cellular mobile telephone services, Joshua Chideme, said on Monday that the line capacity could go up to 70,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was hoped that the contract would become effective early 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siemens installed a system designed to cater for 2,000 consumers during the September world solar summit. The same units would also be hired out during the forthcoming group of 15 (G-15) meeting, to be held in Zimbabwe in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chideme said the PTC would only be able to provide a commercial service for the 2,000 units when the proposed tariffs have been gazetted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment, he said, the PTC was charging those people who received the cellular telephones during the summit the same tariffs for normal telephone services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike in some countries, Zimbabwe would not be charging the consumer for receiving a call on a cellular telephone, but would only charge a &quot;roaming&quot; tariff when the person receives a call when abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chideme said the 2,000 lines were already over-subscribed. &quot;The response has been overwhelming. Once the tariffs are gazetted, all 2,000 lines will be taken away and the 20,000 is also over-subscribed,&quot; Chideme said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Customers wanting the cellular service will be connected onto the network by three indigenous service providers, which were appointed by PTC. The three are Cosmo cellular, CST Cellular and Zellco cellular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to providing the mobile sets, the three will offer customers operating instructions, the system for mobile communication (SIM) cards which give a subscriber an identity, tariff packages and coverage maps, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to comment on the affordability of the cellular telephone, Chideme said: &quot;It's a service. As you know, even the normal telephone service is not affordable to 80 percent of Zimbabweans because of the income levels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prices of the hand sets are expected to range from 400 U.S. dollars to 1,000 U.S. dollars and this excludes the price of the Sim Card, which is expected to cost at least 25 U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa has given its official backing to the current peace process in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a meeting in Cape Town Sunday with former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Perez, South African President Nelson Mandela pledged his support for the peace negotiations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela said he would soon be visiting the Middle East &quot;as a peace messenger,&quot; but said he would not interfere in the internal affairs of the countries of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said he would share the South African experience with them. He said that the Middle East would have to work out solutions to its problems for itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Outsiders can only play a role to strengthen the peace process,&quot; He said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initiation of the Middle East peace process, he said, had brought a powerful message of hope. But like all peace-loving people throughout the world, he added, &quot;we are extremely concerned by the apparent impasse&quot; regarding the implementation of the accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our own humble experience has taught us that such accords are delicate matters,&quot; he said, &quot;and integrity in their implementation, and mutual consent where a review of their content may seem necessary, are as important as the substance of the agreements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accepting a peace award at an International Leadership Reunion dinner Sunday, Mandela said that if South Africa had become a symbol of the peace process, it was due to the people of the country themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is they who are honored by the award which you have bestowed upon me,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On their behalf,&quot; he said, &quot;I humbly accept it in the fervent hope that what we have achieved as a nation will in some small way serve as a powerful force of example to our continent, and further afield.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KUMASI, Ghana (PANA) - Ghana's World Bank-sponsored Urban Environmental Sanitation Project (Urban Four), to cover five major towns, is estimated to cost 89.3 million U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major components of the project -- to cover the cities of Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Tema and Tamale -- are storm drainage, sanitation, solid waste, upgrading of low-income urban areas and capacity building to promote productivity and raise living standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is especially designed for lower-income people by improving drainage, sanitation and solid waste services, while it helps to build up the capacity of the metropolitan and municipal assemblies to manage environmental sanitation services.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project will help establish better institutional and financing mechanisms and more effective policy frameworks so that improvements are sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report on the project, to be implemented over a six-year period from September 1996 to the year 2002, says it is being funded with International Development Association (IDA) credit of 71 million dollars, payable in 40 years with a 10-year grace period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Ghana will contribute 8.9 million dollars towards the project, while the metropolitan and municipal assemblies, which are the beneficiaries, would contribute about 5.3 million dollars, representing their shares of community upgrading works, sanitation facilities and solid waste collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-financing of about 3.4 million dollars has been secured from the Nordic Development Fund, while the Netherlands Government would contribute about 600, 000 dollars towards a training programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says the focus of the storm drainage component is to alleviate flooding in built-up urban areas and the highest priority interventions have been selected in Accra, Kumasi and Sekondi-Takoradi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Accra, approximately seven kilometers (4.3 miles) of the city's primary drainage channel, the Odaw, from the Abossey Okai road to the Motorway extension would be dredged and reconstructed as a trapezoidal channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would significantly alleviate flooding in major industrial, commercial and residential areas in and around the city. At the same time, about 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) of secondary drains serving 13 neighborhoods will be reconstructed to alleviate flooding affecting about 20,000 people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Ghana's Interior minister, Col. E.M. Osei-Owusu has resigned, an official statement said Sunday in Accra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Jerry Rawlings has accepted Osei-Owusu's resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His resignation, effective from Nov. 1, follows the publication of an interim report by the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice of investigations into alleged illegal acquisition of assets by some public officers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, last week, made adverse findings against Osei-Owusu; the minister of trade and industry, Ibrahim Adam, and Isaac Adjei-Maafo, a member on the presidential staff. But it exonerated P.V. Obeng, the presidential adviser on governmental Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement quoted Osei-Owusu as saying in letter of resignation that he intended to contest the adverse findings made against him by the commission.  He described the commission's conclusions as grossly unfair and highly disputable in the face of available evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had no alternative than to resign so he could seek justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, he said he would challenge the commission's findings &quot;in the appropriate quarters&quot; so save his family, friends and colleagues embarrassment and to clear his name, as well as protect his honor and hard- won reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed hope that the attorney-general's office would grant him the opportunity to study and comment on the report before a White Paper on the final report is issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its findings, the commission said that the allegation or suspicion that the minister's house was worth 600 million cedis (351,943.31 U.S. dollars) could not be substantiated having regard to the evidence on record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the report says the Commission made &quot;an adverse finding&quot; against Osei-Owusu in that he was &quot;unable to account&quot; for 33 million cedis in excess income from April 1993 to June 1995, a period during which the house was constructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not in a position to determine how his extra income was acquired,&quot; the report says. &quot;Neither has the minister offered any satisfactory explanation or any explanation at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, the reports says: &quot;We recommend that the minister should be made to refund to the state, the excess income of 33,023,182.48 cedis.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Managing Director of the influential and authoritative Daily Times of Nigeria newspaper, Peter Enahoro, has accused the U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria, Walter Carrington, of being responsible for the deterioration of relations between Washington and Abuja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, &quot;Ambassador Carrington has had his own way with his careless utterances in this country for too long. He is blamed by knowledgeable observers for personally carrying a torch for confrontation&quot;, Enahoro, who assumed office recently, said in a critical opinion piece, published by the paper this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informed observers believe that he was expressing official reaction to the embarrassing treatment of the Nigerian foreign minister, Tom Ikimi, at the New York JFK International Airport, and the recent five-nation tour by the Secretary of State, Warren Christopher that sidelined Nigeria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highly respected Nigerian journalist alleged that each time there was an apparent thaw in relations between the two countries, the ambassador and his cronies at the State Department would work out another strategy to heighten the tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article, published on Oct. 15, fell short of calling Ambassador Carrington a loverboy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enahoro attuned that shortly on arrival in Nigeria, the ambassador got himself hooked to a Nigerian belle, whom he later married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Carrington is now being accused of abusing the specific privilege he bestowed on himself by virtue of his marrying a Nigerian. &quot; Perhaps the ambassador feels he had earned the right to interfere rudely in our affairs because he has availed himself of a wife from among us,&quot; the writer says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enahoro quipped: &quot;Ambassador Carrington's amazing lassitude with freely given remarks about the current political affairs of Nigeria has frequently been as unbecoming in its indignity as it had breached diplomatic politesse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Enahoro (alias Peter Pan), returned from more than 20 years in self exile in England, following Nigeria's first 1966 military coup, assumed office as chief of the DAily Times of Nigeria Plc, (the largest media empire in the country in which the government has controlling shares) last month. He is the brother of one of Nigeria's frontline politicians and former information minister under the Gowon military administration that ruled Nigeria for eight years, Anthony Enahoro, now a leading prodemocracy activist in exile in North America. The Daily Times boss accused ambassador Carrington of also abusing his position as an African American, throwing all diplomatic niceties to the wind in his efforts to fan the embers of hate in Nigeria-U.S.  relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enahoro stated that &quot;...he should also be reminded that there is a thing called sovereignty and that Nigeria places a higher value on protecting her status as an independent nation, than putting out the welcome mat for a foreign envoy's anxiety to be seen to have gone native.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article also suggested that Ambassador Carrington does not wield any clout in Washington. Enahoro said, &quot;his allies may be at the State Department and among a declining scattering of influences in the house of representatives, but they are scarcely plentiful at the White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further stated that &quot;Each time they sense a thaw on the horizon, they promptly move the goal posts. Thus when Nigeria strengthened its laws against drug trafficking, Washington said they were not good enough. When Nigeria was commended by no less a body than the United Nations drug control programme for its anti-drug trafficking strictures, Washington buffed that the measures were not being applied anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enahoro said that &quot;all fair-minded persons must surely now begin to wonder what really are the reasons the administration of President Bill Clinton does not wish to restore the traditional good relations between the United States and Nigeria.&quot; He cited the recent tour of some African countries by Secretary of State Warren Christopher who spoke about imposing more sanctions on Nigeria before putting forward his country's proposal to fund an African army that excludes Nigeria, as a case in point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recollected that &quot;South Africa told him to take his case to the U.N.  Ethiopia said the idea was best handled at the level of the OAU, where of course Nigeria has considerable clout. No wonder Christopher took a swipe at Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the trouble with the Clinton African doctrine was that &quot;it equates the voguish pro-democracy campaign with a crude Americanization of the universe. Any country, any administration that resists this misinterpretation becomes a target of calumny and bullying rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enahoro recalled that for the past three years, Nigeria had not received a cent from international financial institutions because of Washington's blocking tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The longer Nigeria survives the blockade, the more vexed Clinton's washington that this country is setting a bad example for other third world countries to stand up to U.S. excesses,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Happily there is little the U.S. administration can do to try to undermine the increasing consolidation of Nigeria's regional and continental power. It was balmy in the first place to imagine that you could speak of a continental African army that excludes Nigeria,&quot; Enahoro concluded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - Text of an October 20 ALERT on Zaire from &quot;Action by Churches Together (ACT),&quot; a worldwide network of churches and their related agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While awaiting last details and revision of appeals (in the magnitude of 1.  3 million US dollars) from partners in Great Lakes Region some news relating to unrest and serious displacement in South Kivu, Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to news agencies up to 250.000 refugees have fled 12 camps near Uvira in South Kivu. The refugees are originally Hutus from Rwanda and Burundi and they are now said to be heading north on the road toward Bukavu.  The situation in Bukavu itself has been tense over several weeks with increasing Za?rian military presence and road blocks in the streets. A large scale influx of refugees to the Bukavu area is likely to increase tension and will put heavy strain on all available resources there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flight of refugees from Uvira started yesterday (Sunday) and has been on the increase today. It follows recent fights between Za?rian army units and local Tutsi groups, Banyamulenge, including attacks at refugee camps and a hospital in the Uvira area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting around Goma (further north) on Saturday only increased tension and may be a warning of further unrest and displacement. Should more fights break out in larger parts of Eastern Zaire (involving forces across the border to Rwanda) the amount of displaced refugees could double or triple on a short notice. This situation has led ACT related partners in the region to start working on contingency plans in case of a worsening situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) OCTOBER 14 - A journalism programme here recently organized a workshop to discuss the role of media in conflict prevention and resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eighth in a series, the seminar which was facilitated by the United States International University - African (USIU-A) ran from September 25 to 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme which began on February 1995 has trained more than 200 practitioners in various fields of specialization including the coverage of elections, feature writing, gender issues, interpretative reporting and investigative journalism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the latest seminar, participants observed that conflicts worldwide, in Africa or Kenya, will always be a source of news and good copy for journalists everywhere, but whenever journalists write about conflicts they probably make situations worse than they already are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wars, bloodshed and death are the very substance which dominate front pages and news bulletins in both print and electronic media the world over, the meeting noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conflicts make an important part of human interest stories, they will continue to dominate both space and time in all the news media, participants agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a stimulated contribution Mr. Joe Kadhi, former managing editor of Kenya's leading mass circulation daily, the Daily Nation, who is currently the journalism programme coordinator at the USIU-A, challenged journalists to become more involved in efforts to ensure that Kenya will never degenerate into a state of bloody civil war similar to what has been experienced elsewhere in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to bloodshed during the 1991-93 political/ethnic land clashes in parts of the country, Mr Kadhi underscored the need for journalists to be exposed to professional ethics of covering conflicts and peace efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The role played by media in stirring up ill feelings among people can clearly be seen in Rwanda, where radio effectively built up hatred among nationals of the same country, although from different ethnic back</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FREETOWN (APS) OCTOBER 14 - At least 17 people were killed in one week in attacks in Sierra Leone by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels, heightening fears that an official ceasefire which has been observed since March this year could be crumbling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 4, the RUF rebels killed at least 12 people in attacks on villages in the eastern Kenema district and seriously wounded about 20 others, including six children aged between 10 and 12 years, reports reaching the Sierra Leonean capital said on October 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week earlier, four civilian mechanics and a soldier died in an ambush by the RUF rebels on the Makeni-Kono highway in the north of the country, military officials in Makeni said on September 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said the ambush was commanded by a woman who used a bayonet to stab the victims before pouring petrol on their corpses to burn them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver of the vehicle escaped into the bush with a gunshot wound, and a military search party later found him and took him to the Makeni government hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A military checkpoint about a mile from the ambush also came under heavy rebel fire which sent the soldiers dashing into the forest, local reporters said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new flare-up in fighting came amid other unconfirmed reports that a military helicopter was hit by sporadic gunfire by rebels at the strategic Mile-91 location, seriously damaging it, although it did not crash. Two soldiers were reportedly killed in the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence sources said government troops later destroyed a rebel base on the outskirts of Mile-91, killing an unspecified number of rebels and capturing a large quantity of arms and ammunition, assorted food items and a stock of rice which was later burnt by the troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on October 7, troops were forced to evacuate about 180 patients suffering from leprosy, polio or tuberculosis from a hospital at Massanga in the north of the country for fear of another rebel attack, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local military commander, Melvin Keita, said that the evacuation was aimed at protecting the hospital from possible looting, while the army wanted to stop rebels setting the town of Massanga ablaze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital, run by an American mission, is fitted with surgical and laboratory equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are taking no chances and we are mounting an armed dragnet around the area. We shall do everything to protect the area as it is a tactical zone bordering a river (the Pampana) which can be used by the rebels to invade other villages,&quot; Keita said on telephone from the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Argentine specialist surgeon at the hospital, Reuben Rostan, was quoted by a local correspondent as saying: &quot;I realise the security issue, but I cannot keep patients here under such heavy military presence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massanga has become a ghost town deserted by most of its 6,000 inhabitants who have sought refuge in the bush so as to avoid being caught in cross-fire should the rebels attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 30 patients signed discharge sheets from the hospital, with those suffering from leprosy being transferred to the Magburaka hospital, while some 70 others with polio or tuberculosis were transported to Makeni, not far from Massanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 4, RUF rebels were blamed for an attack in which three civilians and a soldier died in the town of Mile Five, about 15 kilometres from Massanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massanga is about 12 kilometres from Bumbuna, where an Italian company is currently building a hydro-electric dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This diamond-rich former tourist paradise has been ravaged by civil war between the rebel Revolutionary United Front and successive governments since 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 10,000 people have been killed and more than half the population of 4.5 million have fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clashes have continued despite declarations in favour of peace by both sides.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 17-point communique read by the moderator of the synod of the PCG,Rt.  Rev. Antony Antwi Beeko at the Church of the Resurrection, Accra Central on September 4, the synod reminded the judiciary of the noble role they are expected to play under the Fourth Republican Constitution and urged them not to deviate from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The synod described the judiciary as an institution that is essential for maintenance of democratic gains in the country and prayed that these should not be eroded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the media, the PCG Synod asked the practitioners to be mindful of the great responsibilities in the free practice of their profession and strive to be objective, fair and decent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting also expressed concern about the increased poverty and suffering of the majority of Ghanaians and the looming spectre of a sense of hopelessness and helplessness that threaten many families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The synod appealed to the government to give poverty alleviation measures priority to enable the nation to deal more realistically and effectively with the debilitating poverty which &quot;is obvious in the streets of our towns and villages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also noted with concern the increasing crime wave and violence in the society and emphasised that the containment these vices is an essential element in national development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PCG appealed to the government &quot;to provide the law enforcement agencies with up to date equipment to enable them deal effectively with this situation which is gradually threatening the quality of life of the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Economic Recovery Programme (ERP), the PCG synod noted that the social fallout of the ERP which had resulted in the creation of PAMSCAD - aimed at mitigating the social costs of adjustment, persisted both in scope and intensity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting observed that the health and education sectors are seriously affected by the economic measures and urged the government to take a critical look at the present &quot;Cash and Carry&quot; health system and the experiments in education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The synod nevertheless commended the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Medical Association for the measures they had taken to discipline doctors who charge patients extra fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting expressed great concern that by the end of 1995, Ghana with a population of 18 million people, had 400,000 cases of HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) carriers. Early this year, the Ministry of Health had recorded 18,054 cases countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing these statistics as alarming, the PCG synod appealed to parents and guardians to educate their children and wards to avoid pre-marital sex which is gradually becoming a regular part of youth culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It further urged churches and all other religious bodies to use their pulpits and other educational facilities available to them to wage a relentless war on the spread of AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of the 67th synod which was held at Kyebi in the Akyum Abuakwa presbytery from August 24 to 25, 1995 was Our Lord Our God, Hope for the nation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The definition of education as a basic universal right does not carry much weight when placed against cultural practices affecting the girl- child particularly in Africa. For the Sudanese refugee girl, tradition refers to her early teens as the &quot;maturity&quot; and thus marriageable age, a factor that impacts greatly on the future of this refugee girl/woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the Nuer and Dinka, mainly inhabitants of southern Sudan, girls are still considered a source of wealth as they bring in dowry upon marriage.  This means education for a girl may be overtaken by other cultural priorities, in turn denying her any chance of ever becoming literate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As civil war rages in the vast semi-arid expanse of the southern Sudanese territory, the Sudanese girl is exposed to varying changes and greater risks in her new status as a refugee seeking shelter in other countries. But not so for her culture -- it remains as dominant as ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the nearly 50,000 refugees at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) camp in the north-western Kenya border town of Kakuma, Turkana district, the overwhelming majority (28,000) are Sudanese. Other nationalities include Zaireans, Somali, Rwandese, Burundians and Angolans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, out of 17,700 pupils attending primary school at the camp, only about 2,000 are girls. Due to the disruptions caused by war, many of the girls are in the 14 to 16 years age-group which is traditionally considered the &quot;maturity stage&quot; at which a girl in the village should already be married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much as the Dinka and Nuer girls are poorly represented in primary schools at the camp, they are not spared the impact of culture even in a foreign land.  &quot;They become irritable and anxious for marriage. It may be their parents who give them away,&quot; says Mr. Shadrack Chol a former teacher at Kakuma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chol laments that there are many cases where the girl's parents have hope in their daughter's education, and thus insist against all odds that she continue with schooling. Unfortunately, cases of girls eloping with their suitors are common. The girl may not necessarily have to leave the camp, she could get married right within the same camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elopement is common in Kakuma, despite the fact that it is treated as a taboo among the Dinka and Nuer who believe that a marriage should never occur between a boy and a girl unless the proper rituals have been conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources at the camp told APS that at times, such is the anger of the girl's parents that it has led to physical confrontation with the offending boy to assuage their honour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditionally in the village setting in Sudan, parents of the girl may exact stiff penalties on the family of the young man in the form of cattle -- not less than 100 cows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Mr. Chol, Mrs. Ding Majak, a middle-aged refugee woman in Kakuma believes the problem of elopement in the camp finds root in the perception of &quot;maturity&quot; by the girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Girls become pregnant and sexual pressures lead to vulnerability, now a determining factor in low enrolment and poor retention of females in schools in Kakuma,&quot; says Mrs. Majak. She notes that &quot;by the age of 16, Dinka and Nuer girls are already restive. They begin to get anxious that if they wait longer, nobody will want to marry them thereafter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ayoung educated Sudanese woman says girls mainly elope because they are staying with relatives and guardians, persons who are not their real parents.  As such, girls lack genuine parental guidance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Sudanese teacher who requested anonymity told APS that some girls have been raped at the camp. Girls are regularly sexually harassed which is not surprising given that most of the young men were child soldiers fighting in the civil war, and they retain their violent temperament in the refugee camps, the source explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr. Maker Thiong, director of education at the UNHCR refugee camp told APS education services for refugee children have expanded rapidly since 1992 when the current camp was set up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are over 20 primary schools run by about 350 teachers drawn from different nationalities in the camp. The schools follow the Kenyan curriculum.  Foreign teachers are regularly oriented to the system through courses at Kakuma and at Lodwar Teachers' Training Institute (LTTI).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those courses are conducted because most of the Sudanese teachers followed the Arabic system at home before coming as refugees to Kakuma. Apart from preparing them for the Kenyan education system, the training courses help the beneficiaries encourage the use of the English language,&quot; Thiong told APS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Non-formal education is offered at the Don-Bosco vocational training centre operated by the Holy Cross Catholic church and sponsored by the Lutheran World Federation (LWF). Annually, it recruits students aged 18 and above among the refugees for courses in masonry, building, carpentry, and tailoring for young women and girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Rescue Committee (IRC) offers skills to the disabled through reading and writing as well as sewing and sign language for the deaf and braille for the blind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adult education for women and those deprived by war has already taken off.  Radda Barnen, the Swedish Save the Children Fund, supplies text books and other stationery towards education at the camp. The organization is also involved in the rehabilitation of child soldiers whose traumatic experiences as a result of the conflicts back home make it difficult for them to settle down to a normal life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radda Barnen's &quot;psycho-social programme&quot; involves giving extensive counselling to children, many of whom have been separated from their parents for a long time or have been orphaned. These are in two categories -- the unaccompanied minors who are catered for separately and are encouraged to cook and care for themselves as one way of rediscovering their self worth; and the community based minors who live with guardians in the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, the Radda Barnen programme assistant for services at Radda Barnen in Nairobi told APS: &quot;We are happy that traumatization among the children has been reduced. Some children have been re-united with their parents. The main purpose of the psycho-social programme is to enhance the psycho-social circumstances of affected children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Ocholla, Radda Barnen which focusses on the needs of refugee children that go beyond food and shelter, is also influencing other non-governmental organizations working in southern Sudan to initiate psycho- social and educational programmes to rehabilitate children affected by the traumatic disasters inflicted by wars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Psychologically, the countries of Rwanda and Burundi in Central Africa are full of walking wounded people, traumatised survivors and numerous orphans - it is from this base that these states have to be re-started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of late, there has been a vigorous debate about the unfortunate position of women in conflict situations. Many times, the argument is based on the impact of conflict on women's lives as individuals and as key bearers of family responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Little attention has been paid to the role of women in sustaining conflicts and their capacity to inflict cruelty, not as organised fighters, but as ordinary people shrouded by the notion that they are the 'fairer' sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intricacies of the theories concerning the origins of the races at war in Rwanda and Burundi are often hard to fathom but the fact is, the seemingly irreconcilable differences between the ethnic Hutu and Tutsi remain the stumbling block to ending hostility in the Central African states.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both at national and international levels, women and girls have been described as the principal victims of the genocide in Rwanda, thus obscuring the role of women as aggressors. Another factor which has highlighted women's suffering in the genocide is the extent to which Tutsi women and girls were raped and abducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet another argument to minimise women's responsibilities for their actions is to claim that women killed because they were obliged by their husbands and men-folk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, the Medical Assistance Programme (MAP) International, an organization that concerns itself with conflict resolution and prevention of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) organised a four-day conference in Nairobi, Kenya for traumatised Rwandese and Burundian women with the aim of building hope and stamina in them, following their tragic experiences during genocide in their respective countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other activities at the conference, women testified about their experiences and how they have been dealing with the trauma. Most of them confessed that it is their Christian faith that has kept them going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Rwandese Hutu woman told of how her three children were killed with machetes right in her face because they were Tutsi. She was married to a Tutsi man, who too, was murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Tutsi Rwandese, Liberata, told of how her ten-hour-old infant boy was cut into pieces by a neighbour old woman on her way to fetch water.  Liberata said the old woman feigned sympathy and asked to see the new-born and suddenly, the woman stabbed the baby, claiming that the boy child would be just another Tutsi &quot;inyezi&quot; (cockroach).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the participants at the conference said they had no relatives because they had been killed as they tried to seek refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda and its &quot;twin&quot; Burundi have been described by scholars as a &quot; climatic and ecological island.&quot; Agriculture has always been prosperous. One unique aspect is that the two countries are culturally and linguistically similar. Both have a similar ethnic mix of about 85 per cent Hutu, 14 per cent Tutsi while the remaining one per cent comprises the Twa ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda was plunged into a frenzy of violence and bloodshed on April 6, 1994, the day its president and that of Burundi, Juvenile Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira respectively, were killed in a suspicious plane crash. Within days, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children had been brutally and systematically murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who survived the initial massacres and the escalating civil war fled in panic, desperately seeking some sort of safety in neighbouring countries of Zaire, Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi. Rwanda, one of the most densely populated countries in Africa has been virtually emptied of its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi has been in turmoil since 1993, following a failed coup attempt that resulted in the death of the country's first Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Burundi suffers economic sanctions imposed by neighbouring African states in an effort to reverse the July military coup that ousted Hutu president, Sylvestre Ntibatunganya and replaced him with former military ruler, Pierre Buyoya, amid continuing massacres and increasing refugees in the Central African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hundred days genocide in Rwanda and the escalating civil strife in Burundi is no spontaneous outburst. According to French historian, Gerard Prunier, in his recent book, History of a genocide, the genocide is a result of indoctrination in the &quot;democratic majority&quot; and the &quot;demonisation&quot; of the &quot; feudalists.&quot; The vast majority of victims were the Tutsis. All of them were slated to die, be it women, old people, children or even babies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyhow, the main agents of the genocide were the ordinary peasants themselves. Evidence of this lies in the majority of the survivors' stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Rwanda: Not so innocent, a report published in August 1995 by African Rights, the widespread participation of women in the genocide is a fact that cannot be denied or explained away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The publication says the responsibility lies not only with the chief male architects of the genocide whose strategy was to include as much of the population as possible, but also with many of Rwanda's educated women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Rights is dedicated to working on issues of grave human rights abuses, conflict, famine and civil reconstruction in Africa. The organization does its work by trying to give a voice to Africans concerned with these pressing issues and to urge for more accountability from the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research findings of African Rights carried out last year, indicate that the extent to which women actively participated in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda is unprecedented anywhere in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report revealed that a huge number of educated Hutu women used their education, experience and standing in the community to urge less fortunate women to commit genocide. Some women killed with their own hands, according to the survivors' testimonies published in the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One wonders, what happened to the compassion, institution and motherly instinct women are said to be blessed with? It was even more horrifying to learn from the African Rights publication that even some nuns were involved in precipitating the killing of Tutsis by denying them refuge in their monasteries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Probably, millions would never have died in Rwanda if they had not been betrayed by their neighbours, many of them, people they had considered friends and with whom they were linked in a variety of ways. Many of the survivors can give the names of the people who killed their loved ones and friends, and who tried to murder them, precisely because these killers were men and women who lived in their neighbourhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When all is said and done, trauma or no trauma, there is an immense need for labour in Rwanda, with almost 40 per cent of its population of about 7 million people dead or in exile. Burundi, with some 6 million people faces the danger of a Rwanda-style genocide if immediate steps towards a constitutional rule are not taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda and Burundi are two countries in Africa where the people can justifiably claim to be of the same origin because the degree of similarity in their ethnic groups is remarkable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theoretically therefore, one might imagine that it should be reasonably simple to devise workable solutions that could cater for the aspirations of the Hutus and the Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A democratic political system that could ensure equal participation of all groupings would be a step in the right direction. However, finding that system proves to be a major and almost impossible challenge facing the two Central African states.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI - Call it tragedy, fate or misfortune, but the ordeal of losing nearly all one's children to a debilitating hereditary disease that society hardly understands is a painful experience, at best narrated by one such mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Nyambok, (not her real name) 38, from western Kenya is a sickle cell carrier. Her situation has changed what was once a splendid marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has had six live births since her marriage in 1979 to Wycliff Osore (also not his real name), a clinical officer. However, only one child is still alive today. All the others died in their infancy, but not as one would assume from malaria which is endemic in the area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osore told APS, pressure from his relatives to divorce Nyambok for another wife mounted. To them, she had become the scorn of the village, the carrier of a bad omen from her ancestral home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gradually, he too started despising and mistreating her, something he now blames on ignorance. But his attitude began to change after visiting a private clinic where a doctor diagnosed both of them as sickle cell carriers.  Their children, they realised had died of sickle cell anaemia, a genetical abnormality more prevalent in their home area than elsewhere in this East African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Osores are not unique. Today in Kenya much like elsewhere in Africa, there are many people who are not aware of sickle cell anaemia. Yet it is an ailment that is particularly prevalent in dark skinned people especially blacks. Hence the name &quot;black man's disease.&quot; It is a disease that strains family resources as testified by Lucy Ogot in Nairobi, a mother of girl twins, one of whom is a sickler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And just what is sickle cell anaemia? Prof. Joseph Aluoch, a Kenyan haematologist doctor explains: &quot;The disease is a result of a molecular abnormality in the blood which turns some red cells into the shape of a crescent (quarter moon) or sickle. It is a hereditary abnormality which affects both sexes and cannot be contracted through infection or any other contact,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The term sickle cell disease, however, describes a group of inherited disorders of the haemoglobin. Haemoglobin is a substance (protein) in the red blood cells which picks oxygen from the air in the lungs and carries it to other parts of the body where it is needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Characterised by sickling, the disorders, are as such, a result of an inherited disorder of the haemoglobin structure. Of the disorders, sickle cell anaemia is the most aggressive, devastating and therefore, feared condition. Although it can be managed up to the early 20s, a patient may die from any of its various complications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The physical pain the patient goes through and the psychological suffering the minder of such a patient experiences, let alone the constant medical bills are beyond description,&quot; says Lucy Ogot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A typical characteristic of a red blood cell with sickle cell anaemia is that it has a short life span of only 90 days. The normal blood cell, red or white, has a life span of 120 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This means that such a sickle cell breaks-off quickly in the body to release components that should otherwise be dealt with in the general body metabolism and then broken-down into materials (unwanted waste) that are got rid of by the kidney and liver,&quot; explains Dr. Aluoch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But because these components are released very rapidly, some of them get into the blood circulation and into the tissues before they have been treated under general metabolism. When untreated components get into the blood circulation system, a manifestation of jaundice develops, normally seen in the yellowness of the white of the eye, in skin and the urine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes, the victim experiences pain in the arms, legs, back and stomach when the sickle shaped blood cell gets in the small vessels and obstructs normal blood flow. The obstruction leads to other body tissues being deprived of oxygen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People with such conditions are chronically fatigued because they do not have enough oxygen to burn energy. Other symptoms may include distress, stroke and in children, bed-wetting. For children below two years, because their bones have not fully formed, the swelling diffuses through the rest of the tissues causing the hands and feet to swell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detecting sickle cell in an infant below six months is difficult. At this age, the baby still has pedohaemoglobin, the haemoglobin with which it was born. The baby haemoglobin prevents sickling from taking place but this is short lived as it is replaced with adult haemoglobin six months after birth.  It is usually at this age that the adult haemoglobin, if it is an abnormal sickle cell gene, superimposes on the baby haemoglobin and the symptoms start to manifest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But thanks to modern science, a pre-natal test can detect whether the unborn baby is either sickle cell positive or has a sickle cell trait. Modern medicine can also determine a child's blood gene composition. This is because as an hereditary abnormality, it shows immediately after conception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A child will be a sickle cell carrier or have a sickle cell trait if it has inherited an abnormal haemoglobin gene from one of the parents, be a sickler or have sickle cell anaemia if it inherited two abnormal genes, one from each parent. Off-springs whose parents are both sicklers will definitely be sicklers themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts advise, therefore, to test for blood gene composition before marriage to ensure that not both of the intending couple are either carriers or indeed have sickle cell anaemia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marriage where one of the spouses is only a carrier, may but will not necessarily, bring off-springs who are carriers but not sicklers. On the other hand, children of a sickler parent married to a normal person will always be carriers, but stand a high risk of being sicklers if the other parent is a carrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carriers, that is people who only have the trait, do not suffer from any symptoms of sickle cell anaemia. This is because sickle cell trait is not an illness and, therefore, they are perfectly healthy. When such two people marry, however, they will bear children who are either carriers (have sickle cell trait) or who are sicklers (have sickle cell anaemia.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sickle cell dates back to 1910 when Dr. Herrick discovered its symptoms in an African-American patient in North America. In 1949, a bio-chemist, Leonard Pauline made a molecular description of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ailment has for a long time been regarded as a disease of the black man.  But it has also been found in India, Pakistan, the Middle East and in the Mediterranean region among white people. It is particularly prevalent in malaria endemic zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not surprisingly, Dr. Ian Franklin, a consultant haematologist says in his book, Sickle Cell Disease: A Guide for Patients, Care and Health Workers, that the disease developed as &quot;a by-product of human defence mechanism against malaria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some experts, among them Dr. Aluoch, dispute the link between sickle cell gene and malaria. Dr. Aluoch admits, however, &quot;it has been established that those children with sickle cell trait are able to survive malaria attacks better than those with normal haemoglobin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highest incidence of sickle cell disorders in the world is said to be among the Bakonjo people of the Ruwenzori Mountains in Western Uganda's border areas with Zaire. Here, because of communication problems in the mountain forest, inter-marriage is common among close families, hence the rampant incidence of sickle cell anaemia due to the high carrier rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presently, the only available treatment for sicklers which is close to a cure is the bone marrow transplant. This procedure is done in some specialised centres in Italy, United States of America, England, Israel, South Africa, Iran and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bone marrow transplant is meant to change the sickle cell anaemia patient into a carrier or sickle cell negative, depending on the status of the donor. It is an expensive and tricky undertaking, with some bodies rejecting foreign marrow weeks after the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transplant is best in children between two and ten years when chances of rejection are lower. Chances of rejection are also lower when the donor has a compatible marrow as the patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucy's daughter, Adongo Ambala, 8, underwent transplant in Italy in April this year, thanks to donations from friends, relatives and especially the &quot; invaluable help&quot; of Rev. Fr. Renato Sesana Kizito, an Italian missionary priest of the Comboni Missionaries, and David and Sarah, an Italian couple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chances of Adongo's body rejecting the foreign marrow donated by her twin sister, Apiyo who is only a carrier, are now slim and their mother is very hopeful that the transplant will in due course successfully change Adongo's status from a sickler to a carrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the mean age one can live with the disease in Kenya today is 20 years, only a very small number of sicklers survive up to adulthood and even have children. Prof. Aluoch says he has himself looked after a 66 year-old woman with sickle cell anaemia, who is also a mother of four healthy children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recommends extra care for sicklers and especially prompt response to crises. This includes taking their prescribed drugs and any other medication such as blood transfusions without fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also advises that in the case of children, they should be kept warm and dry, especially in cold or wet weather. They also require lots of fluids to avoid dehydration. They should also be exempted from strenuous activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof. Aluoch advises that when one is diagnosed as a sickler, the patient should be attended to by the same doctor or medical institution, simply due to the fact that both become familiar with that particular condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other experts recommend the formation of national sickle cell associations similar to &quot;heart foundations&quot; or &quot;cancer groupings&quot; in regions where the hereditary ailment is endemic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS (APS) OCTOBER 7 - Nigerian security forces demolished on September 29 an educational and religious complex being built by the fundamentalist Shiite Muslims in the northern town of Zaria, Shiite sources said on September 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complex comprising a school and a prayer room, was under construction in the Padamar Bono district of Zaria - a stronghold of the fundamentalists, who are still angry about the arrest on September 15 of their leader Sheikh Ibrahim Ahmed Zak-Zaki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter was detained after bloody clashes between Christians and Muslims which left two dead and 15 injured at the beginning of September in the mainly Muslim Kaduna state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then at least 17 people have been killed in clashes between the fundamentalists and police during demonstrations organised to demand Zak- Zaki's release.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 70 supporters of Zak-Zaki have been arrested and around 60 have been charged with offences which carry the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No charges have been brought so far against Zak-Zaki who, according to relatives and press reports, has been moved to Port-Harcourt in the extreme south of Nigeria to lessen the risk of his supporters making attempts to free him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The troubles by the fundamentalists also spilled over to neighbouring Niger, where security forces were forced to move in and arrest 17 of the Islamic extremists that claim support for Zak-Zaki who is well-known for making inflammatory statements that have often triggered bitter fighting between Christians and Muslims, Niger's local radio reported on September 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing local authorities, the radio further said that Niger Muslim fundamentalists were arrested on September 13 in Maradi, in eastern Niger, near the border with Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Nigeria is populated mainly by Muslims, who form about 45 per cent of the country's total population of more than 100 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, furious crowds set fire to a church connected with a series of gruesome ritual murders and burned down a score of other buildings in a town in south-eastern Nigeria before police and troops restored order on September 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents of Owerri, contacted on telephone said the security forces appeared to have stopped the rioting, which began on September 24 after police handed the body of a murdered, headless child to his parents and uncovered a trail of bloody killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More human remains, including two heads and two tongues, were found in the church on September 25, before angry residents of Owerri burnt it down, torched other buildings and wrecked dozens of cars in spite of measures by the authorities to quell the rioting, according to press reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government-owned daily Times said that no fewer than 20 human skulls had been found in different parts of Owerri and local people linked the ritual murders with notorious alleged swindlers in the town and burnt down their homes during the rampage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military administrator of Imo state, Colonel Tanko Zabairu, imposed an overnight curfew on Owerri late on September 25 and pledged in a radio broadcast to shed light on the string of killings there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the first targets of the mobs on September 24 was a hotel where police discovered the body of the 11-year-old child, peanut seller Ikechukwu Antony Okonkwo, after finding his head in the boot (truck) of a car during a routine check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police arrested the car's driver, an unidentified man of 32 who worked at the hotel, who later died in mysterious circumstances on September 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before crowds set fire to the hotel on September 24, police unearthed 17 other headless bodies there, according to the daily Times, while the independent Champion said human remains had been found in nine graves dug on the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 15 more buildings were burnt down on October 1 and soldiers were despatched to Owerri to help restore calm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE (APS) OCTOBER 7 - Churches in Africa have been challenged to incorporate women and youth in church programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 80 women and youth delegates, attending a pan-African consultation here from September 30 to October 4 on the subject; Celebrating in Hope; Restoring Just Relationships emphasized the fact that although women and youth comprise the majority of followers in any given Christian community, their presence is not matched with the kind of responsibility they are accorded in the church arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some instances, they (youth) have been regarded as radicals when they have raised their concerns on certain issues concerning their role in the church. The phenomenon has reduced some of them to mere church goers rather than participants in the vineyard,&quot; Rev. MacDonald Sylvester Sembereka, one of the regional co-ordinators for the Association of Christian Lay Centres in Africa (ACLCA), which had organised the consultation, complained.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her presentation focussing on the marginalisation of women and youth, Cameroonian social worker Mrs. Grace Eneme, said women's demand for equal participation with men in the vineyard has been viewed as &quot;simple noise from women wanting to be equal with men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She cited the issue of women's ordination into priesthood as a case at hand.  Despite the fact that women have raised the concern for some time now, women's ordination continues to divide rather than unite the church, Eneme lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegates, who represented member lay centres of ACLCA were drawn from Kenya, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, Lesotho, Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Benin, Malawi, Zambia, Egypt, Uganda, and Ghana. There was also an invited fraternal delegate from the Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consultation deliberated on various issues including drug abuse and trafficking, human rights, democracy and civil society; liberalization of economies and their effects; marginalisation of women and youth and caring partnership with the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The issues were designed to match with the ACLCA silver jubilee celebrations, under the challenging theme; Celebrating in Hope; Restoring Just Relationships, and we hope they will not only have impact on the celebrations, to be marked from October 6 to 13, but also in the years to come,&quot; said Rev. Johan Katoneene, the association's Executive Secretary in an interview with APS here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her paper on drugs abuse and trafficking, Zimbabwean health educator Mrs.  Ginah Madlela told delegates that the trends in the frequency of drug abuse reveal a general increase in the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although many of the so-called hard drugs which are freely available in many countries throughout the world are severely restricted or prohibited in Zimbabwe, nevertheless such common drugs as alcohol and tobacco also have far reaching health and social consequences,&quot; she stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although drugs in medicine are prescribed following clinical diagnosis with the intention to cure disease, with others going to induce comfort and relieve pain, the Zimbabwean health educator cautioned that &quot;drugs need wise use as their misuse is dangerous, producing effects of dependence, overdose and even death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the consultation, delegates made various recommendations.  These included an appeal on churches in Africa to change their current structures, to accommodate the equal participation of women, youth and men in church development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As of now, some of the church structures make it impossible for women and young people to participate fully in the pastoral programmes. Their rights are either blocked or completely not free. We definitely need to change some of the church structures to accommodate this,&quot; noted Rev. Lawford Imunde, one of the resource persons at the consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegates also called for a change of attitude and mentality among the men, who happen to dominate church leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of them will have to change; lest the change changes them. Some of their mentality and attitudes towards both women and youth participation in the church are detrimental to the church institution, more so today and should be done away with,&quot; remarked a youth delegate from Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Churches and church organizations like the ACLCA were called upon to develop diversified programmes which would contribute effectively towards combating issues of human rights and drug abuse/trafficking, which the meeting described as a threat to the health of both the nation and the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a goodwill message to the consultation, the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) Youth Executive Secretary, Mr. Khepi Shole lamented that the consultation is being held at a time when the youth of Africa have little to celebrate about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You also meet at a time when we are all witnessing disintegration of social fabrics, breaking of families and relationships, the AACC message further stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the message also called upon the youth not to despair, saying in celebration there is thanksgiving, unity in relationships and a mission in hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another goodwill message sent from the AACC Women's Desk, assured the meeting and the church in Africa that the women's department was willing to cooperate and work together for a just and better church and Christian communities in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message, was delivered on behalf of the AACC by Suzane Mutale of the Women's Desk of the Zambian Christian Council.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) OCTOBER 7 - The church in Africa should work harder for the survival of the continent, taking into account that she is among the social institutions with facilities and resources for leadership development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivering a public lecture at the University of Nairobi here on September 26, Kenyan theologian Prof. Jesse Mugambi, said..&quot;at a time when state apparatus in many African countries seem desolate, the churches and other religious agencies can and should provide a stabilizing and catapulting influence, on the African societies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Philosophy can and should help churches and other religious agencies to become more self-critical in this endeavour of norm- setting,&quot; said the theology scholar, who is also a consultant with the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cautioning that a society which is religiously divided cannot achieve national unity, Prof. Mugambi quoting the Bible said &quot;...it was for this reason that Constantine summoned and presided over the council of Nicea in the fourth century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing Kenya as an example, Prof. Mugambi said; &quot;In Kenya today, the concern for mutual respect, mutual appreciation and reciprocation will go a long way towards enhancing national cohesion and social harmony. Social reconstruction in this direction, he stressed, can be achieved through the principle of co-existence on the basis of concerns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that much as common-sense demands that we accept our different individualities, we should at the same time acknowledge that we have many things in common, he emphasised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observing that religion can facilitate this perspective, Prof. Mugambi also regretted that &quot;religion has often been used to highlight differences, while it should have been used to promote reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious people of all religions ought to be peacemakers and agents of reconciliation, Prof. Mugambi pointed out. In all culture, he added, the people are searching for lighthouses in the troubled ocean of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if a religion fails to provide guidance, its followers become very frustrated and end up experimenting with other new cults in their search for help, Prof. Mugambi explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenyan scholar singled out South Africa as one country where the church has not only been an important agent of change, but a stabilizing and harmonising factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He however, also lamented that in most African countries, the role of religion has sometimes been ambiguous if not confused. He attributed this lack of a clear purpose to failure to know when one should advocate for change and when one should press for conservatism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof. Mugambi challenged the leaders to take up their responsibility seriously arguing that the majority of their followers often depend on that guidance be it headed by conservatives, reformers, iconoclasts or prophets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That &quot;people live in tension between the past and the future,&quot; might sound a commonplace statement said the Kenyan scholar. But he noted that it has very serious implications, given that &quot;whether we shall starve as a nation in the next decade will depend on how we perceive ourselves today.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is heartening to see the Southern African public sector broadcasting Authority taking a keen interest in community and grassroots initiatives like this one,&quot; says MISA Director Methaetsile Leepile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The conference should come out with strategies for co-ordinating the efforts of the various players in community broadcasting in eastern and southern Africa.&quot; The 'Community Voices' conference comes in the wake of MISA's commitment to represent all forms of independent media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Topics for discussion during the five-day 'Community Voices' conference include, community media funding; the role of community media in promoting democracy and development; capacity building, training needs; and strategies for promoting the reform of broadcast legislation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairperson of MISA's Chapter in Malawi, Bentry Mndhluli, says Malawi is privileged to host the largest MISA conference yet to be held. &quot;It will be a great opportunity for Malawian journalists to learn from their colleagues elsewhere in the continent. It will also be a chance for us to show them why Malawi is known as the Warm Heart of Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mundhluli further urges Malawian media workers to take a keen interest in the conference with a view to seeing how they too can work towards promoting media freedom and plurality in all sectors of the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates to the MISA 'Community Voices' conference, which is being sponsored by IBIS, the Open Society Institute, the Swedish International Development Aid (SIDA), and Communication Association Foundation, will be drawn from all SADC countries, as well as from Ethiopia, Uganda, Sudan, Kenya, Ghana, Senegal, Europe and North America.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONROVIA (APS) OCTOBER 7 - More than 40 people have been killed in fighting between rival groups of the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO), one of Liberia's warring factions, United Nations sources said on October 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighting in the western Bomi and Grand Cape Mount counties, in which scores of people have been wounded, has threatened the fragile peace process, once again dashing the hopes of war-weary Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clashes intensified on September 29 in Sinje, 75 kilometres northwest of here, and came after a latest pact signed in August to end Liberia's civil war, which began in December 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official of the UN department of humanitarian affairs in Liberia, Kent Page, said aid workers had counted 15 bodies of women and children who were either shot or hacked to death by fighters on the Grand Cape Mount highway on September 30.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said relief workers on September 30 brought to Monrovia four wounded people, including an eight-year-old girl with her right foot chopped off, for medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid staff also saw civilians fleeing down the road on foot with their belongings, while others fled in the forest for safety, Page said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian agencies last week resumed operations in Bomi and Grand Cape Mount counties, which had been cut off for nearly seven months due to clashes between rival ULIMO factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But fresh clashes are currently taking place in towns and villages on the Grand Cape Mount highway, with one witness, who arrived in Monrovia late September 30 from Sinje, telling reporters that the town, which has borne the brunt of the renewed fighting, was attacked by members of the ethnic Mandingo faction known as ULIMO-K, the militia loyal to council of state member Alhaji Kromah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid worker Morris Dolley said the fighters arrived in Sinje at dawn on September 29 and began shooting indiscriminately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone ran into the bushes, leaving behind our food ration provided by aid agencies. We knew they were ULIMO-K fighters because they were not the ones we were with,&quot; Dolley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agencies distributed 21 tonnes of relief food, medicines ad other assorted goods on September 27 to some 5,000 residents in Sinje and four other towns along the highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for ULIMO-K, Alieu Jabateh, denied the accusation his faction was involved in any clashes, saying, &quot;The fighting is between two groups of the Krahn ULIMO wing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The combat has forced local and international relief agencies temporarily to suspend their operations in the two counties in western Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's head of state, Ruth Perry, in a strongly worded statement, on October 1 condemned the new hostilities in Bomi and Grand Cape Mount counties and called on &quot;factions involved in the skirmishes to cease hostilities or be held responsible for endangering the Liberian peace process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perry, a member of the council of state which includes rival faction chiefs, said: &quot;I find it difficult to believe that factional leaders would meet at conferences, sign agreements, and embrace one another only to return home and allow the suffering of the Liberian people to continue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perry, who was expected to attend the current UN General Assembly meetings in New York, said that while attending a session she would give &quot;a full account of developments in the peace process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN special representative to Liberia, Anthony Nyakyi, said in a statement he was in &quot;shock and anguish&quot; about reports of &quot;a cold- blooded massacre of civilians which took place in Sinje, and promised to make urgent arrangements&quot; to probe the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The callousness of the attack is demonstrated by the savage hacking of the leg of an eight-month-old girl who was evacuated by relief workers to Monrovia with other wounded victims,&quot; Nyakyi said, terming it as &quot;a most serious violation of human rights and the rights of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also a violation of the ceasefire which cannot go unpunished,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BANJUL (APS) OCTOBER 7 - Gambia's military strongman Yahya Jammeh, in power since a bloodless military coup two years ago, clinched victory in presidential polls, finally legalizing his rule constitutionally, official results issued on September 27 confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the results were being announced, his main rival Ousainu Darbo was said to be holed up in the Senegalese ambassador's residence in the Gambian capital, but has since left the embassy and congratulated Jammeh for his victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jammeh, 31, won 55.76 per cent of the vote, electoral commission chairman Gabriel Roberts said on national television, compared with 35.34 per cent for his key rival Darbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 88.35 per cent of the 446,541 registered voters cast ballots in the September 26 election in this small west African country of 1.03 million people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several thousand supporters of the president went onto the streets of Banjul at nightfall to celebrate his victory, to the sound of drums and music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reliable sources said Darbo, a 48-year-old lawyer, had sought refuge in the ambassador's home with his family and three other leaders of his United Democratic Party (UDP) late on September 26 &quot;for security reasons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the election campaign pitting Darbo and two other candidates against the 31-year-old colonel, the UDP candidate claimed that there was a plot to assassinate him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late on September 27, Jammeh went on television to urge Gambians to forget their political differences and unite to build a better future, saying he was &quot;very surprised&quot; at reports that Darbo had taken refuge at the Senegalese ambassador's residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The election has been peaceful and free and as far as we are concerned, I have nothing against anybody. I have no scores to settle with him,&quot; Jammeh said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he was disappointed at failing to obtain the 99 per cent of votes he had hoped for, Jammeh said &quot;God decided otherwise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jammeh criticised the organization of the elections saying many voters could not find their names on the electoral rolls, notably those who could not read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 22, Darbo's supporters had been accused of attacking Jammeh's motorcade. The opposition leader said three people were killed and 36 wounded in clashes and accused &quot;agents provocateurs&quot; in Jammeh's Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC) of organizing the disturbances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darbo said Jammeh, who was promoted from lieutenant to colonel before he quit the army to contest the elections, could then declare a state of emergency and cancel the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election represented the second stage in restoring democratic rule, after a referendum in August in which a large majority of citizens backed a new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The staged return to democracy is also aimed at winning vital Western development funds, and turnout was high, with some 90 per cent of electors voting in the capital Banjul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jammeh, who overthrew Gambia's long-serving president Sir Dawda Jawara in a coup in July 1994, is backed by the army, traditional chiefs who asked him to stand and many young people, following the lowering of the voting age to 18.  He has won a certain standing after leading a two-year battle against corruption and unemployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the campaign he traded his normal military uniform for stunning traditional dress, and held top-level discussions with the country's mainly Muslim religious leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darbo, the deputy head of the Banjul bar association, who leads the new United Democratic Party (UDP), is supported by followers of three banned political parties from the Jawara era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His rivals claim that he wants to return to the style of the Jawara regime, which the army accused of corruption. He asserts that sources close to State House, the president's residence, told him of an assassination plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two other candidates were far behind the front-runners, the early electoral commission figures showed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamat Bah, 37, a hotel owner and leader of the National Reconciliation Party, took 5.52 per cent of the votes while radical socialist Sidia Jatta, 50, leader of the People's Democratic Organization for Independence and Socialism, took 2.87 per cent. Parliamentary elections are due to take place before the end of the year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA (APS) OCTOBER 7 - One legislator, a journalist and two unidentified people were arested on October 3, in a crackdown on a four-day contrywide strike by traders protesting the introduction of a new levy - the Value Added Tax (VAT) in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Eric Naigambi confirmed that MP John Ken Lukyamuzi was arrested from his home near Kampala but gave no further details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalist Mulindwa Mulwonge working for the Baganda monarchy Central Broadcasting Service (CBS) radio was arrested from his work station a few hours after the nabbing of the Member of Parliament.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CBS, owned by Uganda's influential monarchy has been broadcasting interviews given by people commenting on the strike which began on September 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike action paralysed business throughout the country with streets and shopping centres entirely abandoned. The traders say they will not re- open their business unless Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni tells them when the new 17 per cent VAT will be abolished or reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say VAT at 17 per cent is forcing them out of business as customers cannot afford to pay the escalated prices on most commodities due to the tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike action was initiated by the Uganda Import and Export Traders Association (UGIETA) whose members distributed anti-VAT leaflets from door to door in the last week of September after the traders' body issued an ultimatum to the government that it withdraw the controversial tax that was introduced during the budget last July. The leaflets read: &quot;Traders please heed this call. We are suspending operations countrywide starting September.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former chairman of UGIETA Captain Mike Mukula said the strike action was the outcry of traders who had been subjected to immense harassment by the Uganda Revenue Authority. He conceded that many traders did not get tax clearances because they had failed to keep proper records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As traders demanded direct talks with President Museveni, they complained bitterly that the Ministry of Finance had not taken heed of their grievances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the government has said it will review the matter in two weeks after consultation with the Cabinet. But the Minister in charge of Internal Security Major Tom Butime said the government will also give protection to any traders who wish to open their shops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows reports that many traders were coerced to join the strike against their will. An Indian trader in Iganga, a town in eastern Uganda, escaped mob action after he attempted to open his shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in Entebbe where the main airport is situated, traders unanimously refused to join in the strike saying it &quot;constitutes a revolt against a popularly elected government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers say the traders' strike will have far reaching repercussions on President Museveni's modernization campaign as it is likely to curtail the flow of funds to the exchequer. According to the budget estimates, Uganda Revenue Authorities collect approximately US$700 million from taxes each year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) -- Authorities in Khartoum, capital of the Sudan, Tuesday, adopted a law that seeks to separate men and women in public places and public gatherings and introduce strict &quot;decency&quot; rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public order, that touches on everything from drinking to dressing, regulates public conduct along the tenets of the Islamic sharia'a law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, passed by the Khartoum state council, says men and women attending public parties such as wedding parties and galas, should be separated by a barrier and they should not sit facing each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women using public transport will not be allowed to sit on the seat near to the driver and the verse from the Koran asking the believers not to look at the opposite sex should be written clearly on the bus wall.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owners of cars used for public transport should not write any expression or word that offends the public taste inside the carriage, the law further says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law bans the use of tape recordings of &quot;obscene&quot; songs in public transport, public and private places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smoking is prohibited in public transport or closed public places, the law stipulates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case of demonstrations and popular processions men and women should march in separate columns. Women should be separated from men in public meetings and political gatherings as well .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men and women, the law further demands, should sit separately in places of recreation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women are not allowed to &quot;move about in marketplaces at night unless with a close male relative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No sports should be performed with short or tight fitting clothes that may reveal the structure of the human body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women sports should be performed in private places and away from places frequented by men, the law adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Called the Provisional Decree for Public Order of the State of Khartoum for 1996, the law bans the allocation of dark areas in public places where individuals and groups can sit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of folklore troupes are obliged to put on dresses that cover the body when performing their shows, the law says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No person, male or female, should go out of his house without wearing clothes that well cover the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The taking of or trafficking of alcohol and narcotics is prohibited in public and in private places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law bans the taking, developing, trafficking and displaying of pictures that contain scenes of naked bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individuals and groups taking part in picnics, of all sorts, should observe this law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Males are obliged not to wait near girl schools or the roads leading to these schools without justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public places that render services near girls schools should not use dark glass windows or curtains at the entrances and such places should be well lit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law also demands that private schools should separate male students from females.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pupils are not allowed to move about outside the school fence during the school day without obtaining permission from the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urinating and defecating is prohibited on roadways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cards and the like should not be played in front of houses or on public roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Khartoum council has suggested a comprehensive media campaign to explain the law to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan adopted the Islamic sharia'a law in 1983. In 1991 the government of General Omar el Bashir issued an amended version of that law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992 the government adopted federal rule to run the culturally and ethnically diverse country of 26 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now it remains to be seen whether other states with Muslim majorities would issue laws similar to the Khartoum law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already courts in northern Sudan apply the Islamic penal code that prescribes certain punishments for thefts, liquor drinking and adultery according to the teachings of the Koran or the tradition of Prophet Mohammed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - An American coffee specialty group concluded a five-day working visit to Ethiopia Tuesday, after a &quot;coffee safari&quot; that also took the group to Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tour, organized under the auspices of the California-based Coffee Specialty Association of America, consisted of producers, importers, roasters and retailers representing 15 U.S. firms, as well as Latin American, European and Australian operators.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group of 27 delegates, of whom 20 were Americans, visited the country as guest of the Ethiopian Coffee Exporters Association, a private sector brokers group, the Ethiopian Coffee Export Enterprise and the Guna Trading Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from briefings by the state-run Ethiopian Coffee and Tea Development Authority, the visitors undertook a two-day field trip to southern Ethiopia.  They toured coffee plantations and coffee washing stations at Yirgachefe and Yirgalem, two major coffee-producing areas, respectively 450 and 10 km south of Addis Ababa, the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is Ethiopia's fourth largest coffee importer, accounting for about 40 million dollars of some 280 million dollars the country earned from the crop in the 1995-96 fiscal year ended in June. Total exports of green beans reached 102,000 tons during the period.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, (PANA) - The United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) will require less than its authorized total strength of 160 military personnel in carrying out its mandate in the West African country, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report Monday to the Security Council, he said that while the final composition of UNOMIL's military component would depend on the deployment of the West African Peace Monitoring Force, or ECOMOG, the U.N. would not field more than 92 military observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in accordance with UNOMIL's mandate, which includes investigating cease-fire violations and monitoring demobilization and disarmament, the mission would require 1 disarmament team of 6 military observers at each of about five disarmament and demobilization centers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNOMIL will also require 2 mobile teams of 6 observers to monitor the implementation of cease-fire, the disengagement of forces and the collection of weapons at areas other than disarmament and demobilization sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council had requested Boutros-Ghali to submit to it proposals for the assistance to be contributed by UNOMIL in support of the Liberian peace process, particularly in the area of disarmament and demobilization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To assess the U.N.'s contributions in these areas, Boutros-Ghali sent a technical team to Liberia from Sept. 26 to Oct. 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNOMIL has 10 military observers in Liberia. An additional 24 of these observers are expected to be deployed later in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Boutros-Ghali is yet to comply with another request by the council on the contributions which the international community could make toward the holding of elections in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ECOWAS and the (Liberian) Council of State are continuing consultations on the nature of the role that the international community should be asked to play in the electoral process,&quot; he said in explaining the delay in making the recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that with little time left before the elections, scheduled for May 1997, the Economic Community of West African States, which sent ECOMOG to Liberian in 1990, should encourage the Council of State to make an early decision on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECOMOG, which still has about 8,500 troops in Liberia, and UNOMIL are monitoring the implementation of the revised Abuja Peace Accord, signed to end just over six years of war in Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Postmaster-General Raymond Mutambirwa, who described the development as historic, said negotiations between the two parties had yielded a final contract sum of 24,204,928 U.S. dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This day marks a momentous occasion in the history of telecommunications in Zimbabwe-the signing of the long awaited mobile telephone services contract,&quot; Mutambirwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tender was awarded to Siemens Telecommunications (PTY) Ltd of South Africa on Sept. 2, following approval by the government tender board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tender had called for a commissioning period of five months after the effective date of contract for Harare and Bulawayo areas. The other major cities and resort areas shall be commissioned four months later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are confident that the giant Siemens company shall be able to pool all its resources and complete the project earlier than the tender projected time, &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The network will have an initial capacity of 20,000 lines, expandable to 70, 000 with an initial coverage of the major cities, tourist centers and the Harare-Bulawayo highway.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, (PANA) - The United Nations General Assembly has elected Kenya, Costa Rica, Japan, Portugal and Sweden, for two-year terms on the Security Council, starting Jan. 1, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya, endorsed by the African group at the U.N. for the African seat to be vacated by Botswana at the end of the year, got 172 votes to win in the first round of balloting Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 180 member-nations voting, Kenya needed 120 votes to secure its seat under the two-thirds majority rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The East African country, which served on the council in the 1970s, will join the Egypt and Guinea-Bissau, which are in the first of their two years as non-permanent members on the 15-member body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan and Sweden also won in the first round. Japan polled 142 votes to beat India (40). Sweden got 153 votes to beat Portugal (112) and Australia (91), thereby clinching one of the two seats reserved for Western European and other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the election for the South and Central America, and Caribbean seat, no winner emerged in the first round, where Costa Rica scored 105, Bolivia 73, and Colombia as well as Dominican Republic got one each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second round of balloting, Portugal outpolled Australia 124 to 57 to win the other seat for Western European and other states. Bolivia withdrew to increase Costa Rica's chances of winning, with 167 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly-elected members will join Chile, Egypt, Guinea-Bissau, Poland and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) -- as the 10 non-permanent members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States are the five permanent members on the council, the powerful organ responsible for maintenance of international peace and security.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia's newly appointed independent electoral commission has set Oct. 25 and 28 as nominations dates, respectively, for presidential and parliamentary candidates intending to contest the general elections in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dates were announced Monday in the capital, Lusaka, by Deputy Director of Elections Joel Sikazwe. The dates, which seem to have caught some opposition parties unawares, were unveiled hours after President Frederick Chiluba swore-in the five-man Electoral Commission, charged with conducting the November polls.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential candidates will lodge their nomination papers with Chief Justice Mathew Ngulube on Friday. He is, by law, the returning officer for the presidential poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliamentary aspirants vying for the 150 elective seats will hand in their papers to district executive secretaries in various parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidates for the presidency will need to satisfy the chief justice that their bid is supported by 200 registered voters who are holders of green national registration cards to confirm their Zambian citizenship. The candidates are also required to pay a 200-U.S. dollar non-refundable election fee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those vying for parliament need to produce nine registered voters in their constituencies and pay a 20-dollar election fee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New constitutional amendments to the citizenship qualification for the presidency require only Zambians with both parents born in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This effectively bars the country's first post-independence president, Kenneth Kaunda, who had Malawian parents. He had ruled Zambia from 1964 to 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new constitution, which is being challenged by Kaunda, also bars citizens who have held the office of president for at least two previous terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda's insistence that he will contest the elections has raised, further, the political tension in the southern African country. He refused Sunday to be photographed together with Chiluba, to signify the leaders' commitment to peaceful elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda charged that there were still serious political and constitutional matters that needed to be ironed out between the government and opposition groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;peace photo&quot; was proposed by church leaders at a national thanksgiving ceremony to mark the country's 32nd independence anniversary Oct. 24 and to pray for peace during elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's third largest opposition, the Zambia Democratic Congress wrote to the Electoral Commission on Monday to arrange a meeting of political stakeholders in the elections &quot;to level the political playing field.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highly placed opposition circles among the country's major parties, including Kaunda's United National Independence Party, have spoken out in favor of boycotting the elections in protest against the constitution and the disputed voters register prepared by Nikuv, a private Israeli firm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - A United Nations agency, the World Food Programme, said Tuesday it would try later in the day to evacuate scores of U.N.  personnel and those of non-governmental organizations stranded in eastern Zaire because of fighting between government troops and ethnic Tutsi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement from its Rome headquarters to PANA in Dakar, it said that the measure followed a last minute decision by Zaire to allow a chartered aircraft to fly into the strife-torn Uvira, in eastern Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of U.N. and other aid workers stranded there is estimated at between 44 and 54, including two World Food Programme officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers are fleeing the fighting between Zairean troops and ethnic Tutsi, originally from Rwanda but who have been living in Zaire for several generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American-built Hercules transport plane chartered by the U.N. agency has twice tried to fly into Uvira. It was denied permission to land, each time, by the Zaireans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities &quot;insisted that the plane first stop at Bukavu,&quot; the agency said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency said there were reports that refugees were abandoning their camps and that an exodus of at least 200,000 people had begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, other estimates indicate there may be less than 100,000 refugees fleeing the fighting,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency, the largest international food aid donor, has been providing emergency food rations to some 225,000 refugees in the Uvira refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It fed at least 50 million people in 1995, including half of the world's refugees and internally displaced people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (PANA) - About 100 experts from 10 African countries are meeting in Ouagadougou to work out a strategy for epidemics control in the sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, which began Monday, is also aimed at &quot;putting an end to the inadequacies still characterizing our capacity to control epidemics&quot;, said Bara Kamfitiye, representative of World Health Organization regional director for Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For three days, the experts will work out a policy including actions to be taken for epidemiological control and cases management. Their suggestions will also include the launching of immunization campaigns, social mobilization, and epidemics control systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting comes ahead of the ministers of health conference to be held Oct. 25 in the Burkinabe capital, to discuss the spread of meningitis, cholera and measles epidemics which have claimed several lives in the sub- region in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 150,000 meningitis cases, including 16,000 deaths, and 50,000 cholera cases (4,000 deaths), were recorded in 1996, according to WHO statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The figures are appalling and unacceptable&quot;, Kamfitiye said, adding that, &quot; we have to take coherent and concerted actions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Technologies are available, human and financial resources can be found. We have to change our ways of working and direct our actions and resources to get appreciable results,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) -- Authorities in Khartoum, capital of the Sudan, Tuesday, adopted a law that seeks to separate men and women in public places and public gatherings and introduce strict &quot;decency&quot; rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public order, that touches on everything from drinking to dressing, regulates public conduct along the tenets of the Islamic sharia'a law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, passed by the Khartoum state council, says men and women attending public parties such as wedding parties and galas, should be separated by a barrier and they should not sit facing each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women using public transport will not be allowed to sit on the seat near to the driver and the verse from the Koran asking the believers not to look at the opposite sex should be written clearly on the bus wall.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owners of cars used for public transport should not write any expression or word that offends the public taste inside the carriage, the law further says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law bans the use of tape recordings of &quot;obscene&quot; songs in public transport, public and private places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smoking is prohibited in public transport or closed public places, the law stipulates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case of demonstrations and popular processions men and women should march in separate columns. Women should be separated from men in public meetings and political gatherings as well .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men and women, the law further demands, should sit separately in places of recreation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women are not allowed to &quot;move about in marketplaces at night unless with a close male relative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No sports should be performed with short or tight fitting clothes that may reveal the structure of the human body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women sports should be performed in private places and away from places frequented by men, the law adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Called the Provisional Decree for Public Order of the State of Khartoum for 1996, the law bans the allocation of dark areas in public places where individuals and groups can sit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of folklore troupes are obliged to put on dresses that cover the body when performing their shows, the law says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No person, male or female, should go out of his house without wearing clothes that well cover the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The taking of or trafficking of alcohol and narcotics is prohibited in public and in private places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law bans the taking, developing, trafficking and displaying of pictures that contain scenes of naked bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individuals and groups taking part in picnics, of all sorts, should observe this law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Males are obliged not to wait near girl schools or the roads leading to these schools without justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public places that render services near girls schools should not use dark glass windows or curtains at the entrances and such places should be well lit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law also demands that private schools should separate male students from females.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pupils are not allowed to move about outside the school fence during the school day without obtaining permission from the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urinating and defecating is prohibited on roadways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cards and the like should not be played in front of houses or on public roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Khartoum council has suggested a comprehensive media campaign to explain the law to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan adopted the Islamic sharia'a law in 1983. In 1991 the government of General Omar el Bashir issued an amended version of that law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992 the government adopted federal rule to run the culturally and ethnically diverse country of 26 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now it remains to be seen whether other states with Muslim majorities would issue laws similar to the Khartoum law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already courts in northern Sudan apply the Islamic penal code that prescribes certain punishments for thefts, liquor drinking and adultery according to the teachings of the Koran or the tradition of Prophet Mohammed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - An American coffee specialty group concluded a five-day working visit to Ethiopia Tuesday, after a &quot;coffee safari&quot; that also took the group to Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tour, organized under the auspices of the California-based Coffee Specialty Association of America, consisted of producers, importers, roasters and retailers representing 15 U.S. firms, as well as Latin American, European and Australian operators.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group of 27 delegates, of whom 20 were Americans, visited the country as guest of the Ethiopian Coffee Exporters Association, a private sector brokers group, the Ethiopian Coffee Export Enterprise and the Guna Trading Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from briefings by the state-run Ethiopian Coffee and Tea Development Authority, the visitors undertook a two-day field trip to southern Ethiopia.  They toured coffee plantations and coffee washing stations at Yirgachefe and Yirgalem, two major coffee-producing areas, respectively 450 and 10 km south of Addis Ababa, the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is Ethiopia's fourth largest coffee importer, accounting for about 40 million dollars of some 280 million dollars the country earned from the crop in the 1995-96 fiscal year ended in June. Total exports of green beans reached 102,000 tons during the period.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, (PANA) - The United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) will require less than its authorized total strength of 160 military personnel in carrying out its mandate in the West African country, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report Monday to the Security Council, he said that while the final composition of UNOMIL's military component would depend on the deployment of the West African Peace Monitoring Force, or ECOMOG, the U.N. would not field more than 92 military observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in accordance with UNOMIL's mandate, which includes investigating cease-fire violations and monitoring demobilization and disarmament, the mission would require 1 disarmament team of 6 military observers at each of about five disarmament and demobilization centers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNOMIL will also require 2 mobile teams of 6 observers to monitor the implementation of cease-fire, the disengagement of forces and the collection of weapons at areas other than disarmament and demobilization sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council had requested Boutros-Ghali to submit to it proposals for the assistance to be contributed by UNOMIL in support of the Liberian peace process, particularly in the area of disarmament and demobilization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To assess the U.N.'s contributions in these areas, Boutros-Ghali sent a technical team to Liberia from Sept. 26 to Oct. 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNOMIL has 10 military observers in Liberia. An additional 24 of these observers are expected to be deployed later in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Boutros-Ghali is yet to comply with another request by the council on the contributions which the international community could make toward the holding of elections in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ECOWAS and the (Liberian) Council of State are continuing consultations on the nature of the role that the international community should be asked to play in the electoral process,&quot; he said in explaining the delay in making the recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that with little time left before the elections, scheduled for May 1997, the Economic Community of West African States, which sent ECOMOG to Liberian in 1990, should encourage the Council of State to make an early decision on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECOMOG, which still has about 8,500 troops in Liberia, and UNOMIL are monitoring the implementation of the revised Abuja Peace Accord, signed to end just over six years of war in Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Zimbabwe Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) and Siemens Telecommunications of South Africa on Tuesday signed a 240- -million-zimdollar (24 million USD) contract to introduce a mobile telephone service, a first for Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Postmaster-General Raymond Mutambirwa, who described the development as historic, said negotiations between the two parties had yielded a final contract sum of 24,204,928 U.S. dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This day marks a momentous occasion in the history of telecommunications in Zimbabwe-the signing of the long awaited mobile telephone services contract,&quot; Mutambirwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tender was awarded to Siemens Telecommunications (PTY) Ltd of South Africa on Sept. 2, following approval by the government tender board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tender had called for a commissioning period of five months after the effective date of contract for Harare and Bulawayo areas. The other major cities and resort areas shall be commissioned four months later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are confident that the giant Siemens company shall be able to pool all its resources and complete the project earlier than the tender projected time, &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The network will have an initial capacity of 20,000 lines, expandable to 70, 000 with an initial coverage of the major cities, tourist centers and the Harare-Bulawayo highway.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, (PANA) - The United Nations General Assembly has elected Kenya, Costa Rica, Japan, Portugal and Sweden, for two-year terms on the Security Council, starting Jan. 1, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya, endorsed by the African group at the U.N. for the African seat to be vacated by Botswana at the end of the year, got 172 votes to win in the first round of balloting Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 180 member-nations voting, Kenya needed 120 votes to secure its seat under the two-thirds majority rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The East African country, which served on the council in the 1970s, will join the Egypt and Guinea-Bissau, which are in the first of their two years as non-permanent members on the 15-member body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan and Sweden also won in the first round. Japan polled 142 votes to beat India (40). Sweden got 153 votes to beat Portugal (112) and Australia (91), thereby clinching one of the two seats reserved for Western European and other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the election for the South and Central America, and Caribbean seat, no winner emerged in the first round, where Costa Rica scored 105, Bolivia 73, and Colombia as well as Dominican Republic got one each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second round of balloting, Portugal outpolled Australia 124 to 57 to win the other seat for Western European and other states. Bolivia withdrew to increase Costa Rica's chances of winning, with 167 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly-elected members will join Chile, Egypt, Guinea-Bissau, Poland and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) -- as the 10 non-permanent members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States are the five permanent members on the council, the powerful organ responsible for maintenance of international peace and security.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia's newly appointed independent electoral commission has set Oct. 25 and 28 as nominations dates, respectively, for presidential and parliamentary candidates intending to contest the general elections in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dates were announced Monday in the capital, Lusaka, by Deputy Director of Elections Joel Sikazwe. The dates, which seem to have caught some opposition parties unawares, were unveiled hours after President Frederick Chiluba swore-in the five-man Electoral Commission, charged with conducting the November polls.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential candidates will lodge their nomination papers with Chief Justice Mathew Ngulube on Friday. He is, by law, the returning officer for the presidential poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliamentary aspirants vying for the 150 elective seats will hand in their papers to district executive secretaries in various parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidates for the presidency will need to satisfy the chief justice that their bid is supported by 200 registered voters who are holders of green national registration cards to confirm their Zambian citizenship. The candidates are also required to pay a 200-U.S. dollar non-refundable election fee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those vying for parliament need to produce nine registered voters in their constituencies and pay a 20-dollar election fee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New constitutional amendments to the citizenship qualification for the presidency require only Zambians with both parents born in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This effectively bars the country's first post-independence president, Kenneth Kaunda, who had Malawian parents. He had ruled Zambia from 1964 to 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new constitution, which is being challenged by Kaunda, also bars citizens who have held the office of president for at least two previous terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda's insistence that he will contest the elections has raised, further, the political tension in the southern African country. He refused Sunday to be photographed together with Chiluba, to signify the leaders' commitment to peaceful elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda charged that there were still serious political and constitutional matters that needed to be ironed out between the government and opposition groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;peace photo&quot; was proposed by church leaders at a national thanksgiving ceremony to mark the country's 32nd independence anniversary Oct. 24 and to pray for peace during elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's third largest opposition, the Zambia Democratic Congress wrote to the Electoral Commission on Monday to arrange a meeting of political stakeholders in the elections &quot;to level the political playing field.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highly placed opposition circles among the country's major parties, including Kaunda's United National Independence Party, have spoken out in favor of boycotting the elections in protest against the constitution and the disputed voters register prepared by Nikuv, a private Israeli firm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - A United Nations agency, the World Food Programme, said Tuesday it would try later in the day to evacuate scores of U.N.  personnel and those of non-governmental organizations stranded in eastern Zaire because of fighting between government troops and ethnic Tutsi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement from its Rome headquarters to PANA in Dakar, it said that the measure followed a last minute decision by Zaire to allow a chartered aircraft to fly into the strife-torn Uvira, in eastern Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of U.N. and other aid workers stranded there is estimated at between 44 and 54, including two World Food Programme officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers are fleeing the fighting between Zairean troops and ethnic Tutsi, originally from Rwanda but who have been living in Zaire for several generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American-built Hercules transport plane chartered by the U.N. agency has twice tried to fly into Uvira. It was denied permission to land, each time, by the Zaireans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities &quot;insisted that the plane first stop at Bukavu,&quot; the agency said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency said there were reports that refugees were abandoning their camps and that an exodus of at least 200,000 people had begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, other estimates indicate there may be less than 100,000 refugees fleeing the fighting,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency, the largest international food aid donor, has been providing emergency food rations to some 225,000 refugees in the Uvira refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It fed at least 50 million people in 1995, including half of the world's refugees and internally displaced people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (PANA) - About 100 experts from 10 African countries are meeting in Ouagadougou to work out a strategy for epidemics control in the sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, which began Monday, is also aimed at &quot;putting an end to the inadequacies still characterizing our capacity to control epidemics&quot;, said Bara Kamfitiye, representative of World Health Organization regional director for Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For three days, the experts will work out a policy including actions to be taken for epidemiological control and cases management. Their suggestions will also include the launching of immunization campaigns, social mobilization, and epidemics control systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting comes ahead of the ministers of health conference to be held Oct. 25 in the Burkinabe capital, to discuss the spread of meningitis, cholera and measles epidemics which have claimed several lives in the sub- region in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 150,000 meningitis cases, including 16,000 deaths, and 50,000 cholera cases (4,000 deaths), were recorded in 1996, according to WHO statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The figures are appalling and unacceptable&quot;, Kamfitiye said, adding that, &quot; we have to take coherent and concerted actions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Technologies are available, human and financial resources can be found. We have to change our ways of working and direct our actions and resources to get appreciable results,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - This is number 31 (14 - 21 October 1996) in a series of weekly reports from IRIN on general developments in the Great Lakes region. Sources for the information below include UN agencies, NGOs, other international organisations and media reports. IRIN issues these reports for the benefit of the humanitarian community, but accepts no responsibility as to the accuracy of the original sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the events in Eastern Zaire over the last few days, this Weekly Round Up includes events up to and including Monday 21 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Thousands of Hutu refugees are reported as arriving near Bukavu town after having fled refugee camps in the Uvira area on Monday. Yesterday (Monday 21 October), UNHCR declared that the 12 camps, home to 220,000 refugees, two thirds of whom are Burundian, had been deserted and that refugees were heading into neighbouring hills or north towards Bukavu town.  Their flight was prompted by fighting between armed groups, including the Zairean Army and Banyamulenge militia, which flared up on Friday and lasted through the weekend, claiming at least 78 lives. The fighting was reported to be particularly intense in the area around the Kiliba airstrip, 20 kms north of Uvira town. (WFP evacuated 48 humanitarian workers from Uvira on Tuesday 22 October 1996.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current crisis is the most serious to have affected Eastern Zaire since refugees began to flee Burundi following the killing of President Ndadaye in October 1993. The fighting which compelled the refugees to leave is a clear sign of the escalation of the conflict, which has been sparked off by claims to Zairean nationality by people of Rwandan descent who migrated into the region over several centuries. The recent upsurge in hostilities follows the 8 October statement by the deputy governor of South Kivu, Lwasi Ngabo Lwabanji, in which he said that the Banyamulenge had one week to leave Uvira for neighbouring countries. The statement prompted Zaire's Prime Minister, Kengo wa Dondo, to suspend the deputy governor for overstepping his authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire and Rwanda continue to trade accusations of responsibility for the crisis, with Kengo wa Dondo claiming on Wednesday that the Rwandese Patriotic Army had supplied the Banyamulenge with heavy weapons. The Rwandese Government, for its part, has denied Zaire's allegations and accused the Zairean authorities of instigating the conflict. Meanwhile, responsibility for the attack on Runingo refugee camp during the weekend of 12 and 13 October, which resulted in four deaths and 6 injuries, continues to be unclear, with Banyamulenge spokesmen alleging that the Zairean Army carried it out and the Zairean authorities blaming the Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The escalating insecurity in the Uvira area has been matched by a growing number of incidents near Goma town in North Kivu. On 21 October there were reports of an attack on the ZCSC contingent base at Katale camp and on villages in the area, while an attack near Kibumba camp on a bus carrying a local football team was reported to have resulted in several deaths. On 6 October a rocket against a bus near Kibumba camp left 7 local people dead and 6 injured. Responsibility for these attacks remains unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The escalating insecurity in the Kivu Provinces prompted expressions of concern from aid agencies and diplomats working on the region. On Thursday the EU's Special Envoy for the Great Lakes, Aldo Ajello, said that the EU was extremely concerned about the tension between Rwanda and Zaire and warned the Zairean Government not to confuse the &quot;limited problem of possible infiltration by young armed Banyamulenge with the much larger problem of the legal status of the Banyamulenge who have long lived, sometimes for several generations, on the plateaux of the Uvira region.&quot; He said any such confusion would &quot;spark off a campaign of ethnic hatred&quot;. On Friday the ICRC called for restraint by the parties to the conflict and urged them to respect the laws of war and ensure the safety of the staff of humanitarian organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, two senior UN officials are on mission in the region. Ibrahima Fall, the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy to Zaire, is undertaking discussions with the Zairean authorities to quash repeated allegations that the UNHCR has assisted Banyamulenge to infiltrate from Rwanda. These had previously been retracted by the Zairean Government but had later been repeated by General Eluki, Zairean Armed Forces Chief of Staff. The Secretary- General on 14 October dismissed the repeated allegations as &quot;baseless and outdated&quot;. Roberto Garreton, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Zaire is also on a two week mission to the region, which began on 14 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Burundi's leader Pierre Buyoya said again at the weekend that the new regime will not be forced into peace talks with rebels while regional economic sanctions on Burundi remain in place. Buyoya told a visiting delegation of foreign ministers that he was committed to eventual negotiations, but would not hold talks &quot;while there was a noose around his neck&quot;. The sanctions were imposed by regional leaders shortly after July's military coup in an effort to force Buyoya to unban political parties, restore the constitution and meet rebel groups for peace talks. Buyoya has, to some extent, met two of the three conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday's visit by the Ministers followed the 14 October Arusha III Summit where it was agreed that sanctions would continue but that a review would be carried out in Burundi by foreign ministers. The ministers postponed the visit from Wednesday after Buyoya announced that it would not begin talks with rebels until the blockade was lifted. At the Summit, Burundi was given a month's deadline for the start of unconditional all-party negotiations. The next meeting of the sanctions monitoring committee is due to be held in Lusaka on 7 November and there are strong indications that another regional Summit may be held shortly afterwards, perhaps on the 12th. The National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), meanwhile, has stated that it is ready to enter into talks but has urged an extension of the sanctions to cover supplies of arms and ammunition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier last week, the Prime Minister of Burundi called the sanctions &quot; illegal, unjust and biased&quot; and said that it had already cost Burundi a loss of income of more than US$ 162 million. Food prices in Bujumbura are reported to have stabilised and a steady supply of black market fuel has helped to bring down the cost of petrol and diesel. Burundi's main brewery which suspended distribution last month after two of its staff were killed in ambushes on beer trucks may have to stop operations altogether because of shortages of fuel and spare parts. The brewery is one of the main sources of government revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The World Health Organisation (WHO) is sending 50,000 doses of vaccine to Burundi in a bid to halt the spread of meningitis which has claimed almost 40 lives. As of 17 October, 131 cases had been registered. Medical supplies were amongst the first items to be exempted from sanctions and over 100,000 doses of vaccine have already been delivered. Doctors say that an early response by the health ministry has averted a crisis on a much larger scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The European Union's special envoy to the Great Lakes region, Aldo Ajello said on Thursday that he hoped for positive results over the repatriation of Rwandan refugees in Zaire. Mr. Ajello said that a plan had been drawn up by UNHCR but that this could be carried out only with the cooperation of the international community, the concerned nations and &quot;above all, cooperation from the nations concerned themselves&quot;. Zaire's Prime Minister, Kengo wa Dondo said on Wednesday that Zaire will systematically close the camps before elections scheduled for next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Rwanda has appointed a new Minister of Justice, Faustin Nteziryayo, a university professor and former consultant to the International Monetary Fund.  He replaces Marthe Mukamurenzi who resigned last month after being accused of bad management. The appointment coincides with the start of an information campaign on the new legislation designed to facilitate the trial of those accused of genocide. The law was adopted by parliament in August. Over 81,000 people are currently in Rwanda's prisons and places of detention, mostly on charges relating to the 1994 genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Israel and Rwanda have joined forces to build a memorial in Rwanda for the victims of the 1994 genocide. Following a five day visit to Israel, Rwanda's Vice-President and Minister of Defence Paul Kagame said that he had reached an agreement with Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Memorial to build a similar memorial in Rwanda. Kagame told Radio Rwanda: &quot;We have to perpetuate the memory of the 1994 massacres, reform our judicial system so that criminals will be judged and educate our people to build a united nation&quot;. Israeli groups specializing in dealing with genocide have offered assistance to Rwanda and discussions have taken place about Israeli technical aid in training and irrigation, as well as fertilisers and pesticides. Rwanda broke diplomatic ties with Israel in 1976 but restored them after the 1994 genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Some 84 UN and NGO staff were pulled out of Pakele, northern Uganda after the UNHCR/Lutheran World Federation offices were attacked and ransacked.  The armed gang burned vehicles and communications equipment and is reported to have also attacked military installations in the area. The UNHCR office supports about half of the 229,000 Sudanese refugees in northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last few weeks, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has been accused of kidnapping 300 Ugandans from villages in northern Uganda and taking them to their training camps in Sudan. On Monday, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni launched a new attack on the Sudan government whom Uganda accuses of supporting two rebel movements, including the LRA, in an effort to destabilise Uganda. Sudan has denied the charges and accuses Uganda of supporting the southern Sudanese rebel groups. The two countries broke off diplomatic relations in April 1995, but signed a normalization accord in September during talks brokered by Iran. Since the peace talks began, there has ironically been a marked escalation in rebel activities in northern Uganda. Museveni's recent comment that he had &quot;no faith in the current negotiations&quot; have cast doubts on the talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Tanzania hopes to reach agreement shortly with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on the release of funds frozen in 1994.  Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, who met with IMF and World Bank officials in Washington last week, said that the IMF and World Bank were &quot;satisfied&quot; with Tanzania's reform programme. He said both agencies had agreed to resume talks for a three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (US$ 200 million) and Structural Adjustment Credit (US$ 100 million) for 1996/97 and 1998/99 to help rehabilitate the country's economy. Mkapa said that agreement with the IMF and World Bank would lead to the release of aid withheld by other donors amounting to US$ 1.2 billion as well as open the door for negotiations on debt relief. Tanzania's external debt stands at US$ 7.8 billion and its servicing consumes 32.5% of the government's income.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Following is a statement from Women's World Banking on its global meeting next month in Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic growth through private sector development is working, and the poor are making it happen. Thousands of small-scale businesses and low income entrepreneurs are bringing new dynamism to the economies of many countries around the world, thanks to a handful of innovative financial institutions that provide small loans, savings facilities and business development services to poor microenterpreneurs. The work of these microfinance providers is fast being recognised as one of the most promising efforts to alleviate poverty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women's World Banking (WWB), a leading microfinance organization and the only global microfinance network that focuses exclusively on women, will be holding its biannual global meeting in Nairobi, Kenya from November 4 to 8, 1996. The theme of the meeting will be on developing strategies for expanding WWB's reach and impact globally. The meeting will be attended leaders of WWB's 47 affiliates, as well as the WWB Board. In addition, representatives from other leading microfinance organizations have been invited to share their experiences on building financial services for the poor, especially in the African context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Barry, President of Women's World Banking, believes that the global meeting is taking place at a critical time. She says, &quot;if we hope to reduce the gap between the 500 million microentrepreneurs who require financial services and the 10 million who currently receive such services, it is essential to develop strategies for reaching more of the poor in sustainable ways.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barry believes that the poor are potential economic producers, not permanent consumers of international aid, and that the major impediment to economic development is that low income people lack access to finance, information and markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through its network of affiliates WWB provides loans, savings programs, technical assistance, business development services, and other financial services to thousands of low income women around the world who are not served by formal banks. The affiliates vary in the size of their assets, number of clients, sources of funding, services provided, and age. They all, however share the same mission: improving the lives of poor women by creating economic opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WWB has shown that increases assets for women lead to important social investments in the family. This means better health and nutrition, education and housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many parts of the world the vast majority of economic activity takes place in small-scale, low-technology enterprises operating outside the formal economy. In Western Africa, for example, it is estimated that this informal sector accounts for a third to a half of GDP, and half to three-quarters of employment. These enterprises are entrepreneurial and market-driven, many are operated by women, and almost all rely on personal sources of credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more information about the WWB Global Meeting please contact Nicola Cunningham Armacost in New York City at 1-212-768-8513, and after November 1 in Nairobi c/o Wairimu Kanja at 569410.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Text of an ALERT from Action by Churches Together (ACT), a worldwide network of churches and related agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uvira refugees approaching Bukavu at a rate of 700 per hour Geneva, 22.  October, 96: Aid workers at a field hospital in Nyangezi, Eastern Zaire, report that approximately 700 refugees per hour are passing their hospital.  The refugees are mainly Hutus originally from Burundi and Rwanda and they are heading north, fleeing fighting around their previous camps in Uvira, Zaire.  The field hospital at Nyangezi is operated by ACT (Action by churches together), Norwegian Church Aid and local agency CEPZa/CELPa.Despite a very difficult security and supply situation in the area the hospital staff is trying to provide basic medical assistance to the refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyangezi hospital is just 22 kilometers south of the town Bukavu where the majority of the refugees seem headed for. Only 1.500 - 2.000 refugees out of potentially 250.000 refugees from Uvira have so far reached Bukavu. ACT staff present in Bukavu express great concern for the supply situation in the area.  Bukavu is practically cut off from overland routes and only holds food and medicine for a few days. Based on what is available preparations are being made by ACT, UNHCR and other NGOs to cover basic needs of the refugees as they reach Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighting at Uvira is between Zairian forces and a local Tutsi militia mainly composed of Banyamulenge. This group has been residing in Eastern Zaire long before the influx of Hutu refugees from Rwanda started in 1994.  The earliest records of Banyamulenge in Zaire dates several centuries back, but recently their relations to the Za?rian Army and the Hutu refugees in the area have developed into armed confrontations and attacks on civilians on both sides of the conflicts. Sunday and Monday the fighting intensified apparently sending the Za?rian Army forces on the retreat and prompting up to 250.000 Hutu refugees to flee ahead of the attacking Banyamulenge militia.  Because of insecurity on the road linking Uvira and Bukavu very little is known about the situation of these refugees. The Banyamulenge militia now seems to be only 50 kilometer south of Bukavu, a major center for humanitarian aid operations in the area. If the armed conflict should spread further into the Bukavu area the humanitarian consequences and related needs are frightening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further north in Eastern Zaire armed conflict and detoriating security situation has been reported over the last days with a focus on fighting in the border region between Zaire, Uganda and Rwanda cutting off the main supply road for humanitarian assistance to the camps near Goma. ACT staff present in the area reports Goma town quiet but roads impassable because of landmines. There have been recent attacks at villages and camps at Kibumba and Katale. Food distributions have been suspended for so far two days. All in all the situation in Eastern Zaire gives reason for great concern. ACT and its partners and in Bukavu (Norwgian Church Aid and CEPZa/CELPa) are working toward meeting immediate medical needs while planning further emergency measures. In Goma (ACT/Lutheran World Federation) is monitoring the situation closely in cooperation with UNHCR. These agencies along with other ACT partners in the region (Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania) are currently drawing up contingency plans for a number of crisis scenarios in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACT Co-ordination Office in Geneva will be putting out one or more appeals on the Greater Lakes Region shortly. For further information, please contact the ACT Communications Officer, Mr Nils Carstensen (Direct phone +41 22 791 6039).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The southern African country was unchanged on the 16th position with 53.57 points, followed by South Africa, which slipped from the 17th to the 19th position with 52.95 points in the rankings released Wednesday from FIFA headquarters Zurich.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Dutch soccer coach Johannes Bonfrere confirmed Wednesday he was resigning his job with Nigeria after almost two months' double deal even as the country's football association denied knowledge of the breakup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I sent my resignation letter in August to the Nigerian Football Association secretary and the chairman, and to Fifa (the world's soccer governing body),&quot; Bonfrere said in a radio interview from Doha, capital of the Gulf state of Qatar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the interview, the spokesman of the Nigerian Football Association, Austin Mgbolu, said as far as he was concerned, &quot;Bonfrere has not ended his two-year contract with Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutchman, who took Nigeria's under-23 team to win the 1996 Olympic soccer gold, has been embroiled in controversy after he failed to return from Atlanta with the victorious squad, claiming alleged shoddy treatment from some officials of the Nigerian Football Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere, who has a two-year contract with Nigeria which ends in 1997, had ended his initial protest and flown to the country in August to receive the 1.  5 million naira (about 9,000 U.S. dollars) cash prize promised him by the Nigerian government for the Olympic success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In apparent response to Bonfrere's complaint, the military government effected changes in the composition of Football Association, although independent soccer buffs in Nigeria had always warned that the Dutchman could have a hidden agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This followed the discovery that, under the guise of being on vacation, Bonfrere left Nigeria in August to take up a clandestine two-month contract with the Qatari national team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In effect, the Dutch coach had enjoyed the best of two worlds, at the expense of Nigeria, according to his resignation &quot;on the air&quot; Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere declined to give the reason for quitting the Nigerian job. He simply said &quot;Nigerians know why I am leaving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts say it is illegal for a coach to handle two national teams preparing for the same Fifa competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soccer analysts say Nigeria may require the services of Fifa to bring the Dutchman to book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere's compatriot and former boss, Clemens Westerhof, left Nigeria in a similar fashion after leading the country to its first world cup outing in USA'94.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only difference was that Westerhof, who is now jobless after a dismal stint in South Africa, announced his own resignation from his home in The Netherlands at end of his annual contract.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa's tourism industry, which surged to new record levels in 1995, is declining in 1996 as a direct result of violent crime in the country's major cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest figures released by the Central Statistical Service show that potential foreign visitors, fearful of South Africa's notorious crime rate, have begun to avoid the country in favor of alternative holiday destinations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says that hotel bed nights sold to foreign tourists in August dropped below 183,000, a decrease of more than 6 percent in comparison with the same month in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most severe effect was felt in Johannesburg, regarded as one of the world's crime capitals, where its share of the national market plummeted to little over half of the level held a year ago, from 20 to only 11 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top destination in South Africa remains Cape Town and the surrounding wine regions, with a share of more than 26 percent of bed-nights sold throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following South Africa's first democratic elections in April 1994, the country's tourist industry blossomed, and in 1995 tourist arrivals rocketed by more than 50 percent to over 1.1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was hoped that the boom would continue in 1996, but growing fears over South Africa's mounting crime rate have in fact reversed the trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official police statistics show that the country is one of the world's most crime-ridden societies. A total of just under 2 million serious crimes were reported in the country in 1995, including about 37,000 rapes, 19,000 murders and 67,000 armed robberies. Only half of these crimes have been solved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Tendai Murape, 15, lies groaning on an old canvass mat on the dusty floor of a thatched wooden-pole hut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his gaunt frame almost limp, he is helped to sit and stare at his visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tendai can hardly speak or eat because of a severe infection of the throat and chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mumbles a &quot;thank you&quot; for the soft drinks that his visitors have brought him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His groans have become part of the sounds of this newly-built bush camp on the western slope of Ziruware hill at Madzima village in Musana communal lands, 70 kilometers (44 miles) north of the capital, Harare, in Zimbabwe's Mashonaland central province. Outside, Dorcas, not her real name, a mental patient, sings praises to &quot;Saint Noah&quot;, leader of the Johane Marange apostolic faith sect otherwise known as Noah Momberume. It is based in Eastern Manicaland province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorcas dances, oblivious of the October mid-day heat, the chains and leg irons tying her to a tree and the cries of her sick baby whom she is loath to suckle for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another hut a woman is in labor, while about 10 meters (11 yards) away another patient, Tendai's sister, dozes off under a tree, one of the few moments she can escape the pain that came with complications after she gave birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She too is having problems breast-feeding her newly-born baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the remaining patients of Chitsidzo, as the camp is called by the local members of the purist sect notorious for its total rejection of any form of scientific medication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two others, James Murape and his son, Ishmael, died last week while two weeks earlier. On Sept. 26, the camp lost another patient, Annah Murape, again from the same family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So devastating have been these deaths that some people now call Chitsidzo the &quot;death camp&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the disaster in the Murape family has not shaken the faith or the bareheaded and single-minded resolve of the elders of the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They insist the remaining patients will stay at the camp and will not receive any conventional medication except prayers and water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the thought itself of taking these patients to a hospital or any such institution for treatment is considered a sin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mortuaries are full of dead bodies. There is nothing there that would persuade me to go to hospital. Death is everywhere. We have lost people here just as people have died in hospitals,&quot; said Simon Nzou, an elder (or Rabahuma) of the local church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nzou's words echo those of other sect members spread across Zimbabwe and in neighbouring countries while the deaths in the Murape family are consistent with the tragedies that have hit sect members across the country because of their rejection of modern medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mashonaland Central provincial governor, Border Gezi, recently warned sect members in his province that they risked being arrested if they prevented medical authorities from immunizing their children against child killer diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This followed the deaths of about 10 children of sect members from measles in the northern Muzarabani district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the &quot;apostles&quot; of Madzima village simply hid their children in the mountains, according to the locals, and a few of them were immunized during the recent campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A measles outbreak in Gutu district of Masvingo province two weeks ago claimed the lives of six children believed to have been members of the sect, whose parents also resisted government efforts to have them immunized against child killer diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another incident, Daniel Mashanda of Uzumba-Maramba-Pfungwe district in Mashonaland East lost his four children to measles in 1995 after refusing to have them treated because of his faith in the sect's teachings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later died recently from untreated burns after he refused hospital treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tendai is trapped in the camp and only survives on the hope that the misfortune that struck his family will not return to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining members of his family say he has to stay at the camp. They cannot afford to be heard or even be seen as entertaining the thought of taking Tendai to hospital. Doing so would be an affront to the dignity of their dead father and they might be shunned by other sect members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That decision can only be made by you men,&quot; says Tendai's mother defensively when it is suggested to her that Tendai should be taken to hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His elder brother, William, says hospital will not be necessary because Tendai will definitely heal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A healer specializing in &quot;throat-cleansing&quot; was expected to return this week to cleanse Tendai's throat wounds using salt and vinegar and his bare hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget about anaesthesia, anti-biotics or sterilization of the &quot;surgical instruments&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week's &quot;throat cleansing&quot; was not successful because Tendai says the wounds did not heal, swallowing solid food is still painful and only milk and mineral drinks will do for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the faith healers fails to treat him, as has already happened with three members of his family, Tendai might be staring into a long dark future, unless the authorities rescue him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Nigerian government is giving serious consideration to selling its 57 percent equities in the petroleum sector to private investors, Finance Minister Anthony Ani has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Tuesday in Lagos, at a workshop on &quot;promoting foreign direct investment in Nigeria&quot;, he said the move would aim at maximizing the opportunities in the oil sector, which accounts for at least 80 percent of the country's total foreign exchange earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government, he said, was also willing to grant licenses to competent private investors for the establishment of export-oriented refineries in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government has opened up the gas sector to foreign investment and is willing to consider appropriate tailor-made incentives for private projects in the sector,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry officials have said that the American company, Exxon and the French concern, Total, could emerge as major beneficiaries of the divestment plan for five years from 1997. Divestment could affect six oil prospecting joint ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investment is worth at least 20 billion U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six joint venture partners -- Shell, Mobil, Chevron, Agip, Elf and Texaco -- may not have been officially notified of the planned divestment, industry officials said. But the partners could be preparing to use the opportunity in strengthening their shareholding, one official added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The joint partners held majority interests before the Nigerian government acquisitions from 1971 to 1979 that reversed the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides the blue chips, indigenous entrepreneurs may be offered fiscal incentives to ease their bids for parts of the equity interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At stake is the government's holding on 12 billion barrels of crude oil, or 60 percent of Nigeria's proven oil reserve estimated at 20 billion barrels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of the investment incentives, Ani said that government intended to privatize the country's four refineries after an evaluation of the current value of each of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said there had been heavy investment in the generation of vital information on solid minerals like coal, gypsum, barytes, kaolin and talc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was room, he added, for foreign investors to invest in coal production in the country on their own account or in joint venture projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the unfolding foreign investment drive, private investors are also to enjoy the liberty to use the abundant gas in the country to provide additional energy which could be sold to the National Electric Power Authority or export to other African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government, the minister said, had also opened up the telecommunication sector to private investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Nigeria had decided to privatize a number of state-owned enterprises in order to free the resources tied up in them for other projects.  But the measure, he said, would not throw people out of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly there shall be no job-losses arising from the restructuring of enterprises necessitated by privatization,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead privatization would open the nation's economy for the needed foreign investment, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia's main opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP), headed by former President Kenneth Kaunda, has decided to boycott the Nov. 18 presidential and general elections in protest against the country's new constitution which bars citizens of migrant parents from contesting the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boycott was announced by Kaunda during an emotional press conference in Lusaka, at which he also appealed to other democratic forces within the country to snub what he called President Frederick Chiluba's &quot;sham elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda broke into tears as he berated the Zambian leadership for playing pranks at a time when their countrymen were suffering all sorts of humiliation from poverty and social decay.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UNIP central committee after a thorough examination of the state of the nation and events leading up to the presidential and parliamentary elections set for Nov. 18, has decided that UNIP will not participate in the elections under the current conditions,&quot; said Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We the men and women in UNIP, our supporters, sympathizers and all Zambians who appreciate the value of free, fair and legitimate elections are determined to keep the peace as we fight for our rights and rights of fellow Zambians against the evil perpetrated by the MMD through its manipulation of the constitution and the electoral process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda said that the decision had been taken in pursuit of the party's cherished ideals of love, truth, honesty, social justice and fair play and intended to establish genuine democracy and good governance in peace, honor and integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is generally accepted, he said, that free and fair elections is the only way of forming government that would have the confidence of the people, but pointed out that the current electoral process fell short of this requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the very beginning there has been no consensus whatsoever among the stake-holders on the process and conduct of the 1996 elections. The entire process has been characterized by irregularities that has led to suspicion and lack of public confidence,&quot; alleged Kaunda, who had Malawian parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accused Nikuv, the private Israeli firm, contracted to register voters of mismanaging the entire registration exercise. Only 2.296 million voters were registered out of an estimated 4.6 million eligible voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the new constitution amendments, Kaunda said that it was &quot;a product of extreme bad faith.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not accept that any political party has any rights to impose the constitution on the people of Zambia without their direct consent,&quot; said Kaunda, who charged that President Frederick Chiluba and his party wanted to &quot; hold onto power at all costs&quot; to plunder public resources.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Dutch soccer coach Johannes Bonfrere confirmed Wednesday he was resigning his job with Nigeria after almost two months' double deal even as the country's football association denied knowledge of the breakup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I sent my resignation letter in August to the Nigerian Football Association secretary and the chairman, and to Fifa (the world's soccer governing body),&quot; Bonfrere said in a radio interview from Doha, capital of the Gulf state of Qatar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the interview, the spokesman of the Nigerian Football Association, Austin Mgbolu, said as far as he was concerned, &quot;Bonfrere has not ended his two-year contract with Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutchman, who took Nigeria's under-23 team to win the 1996 Olympic soccer gold, has been embroiled in controversy after he failed to return from Atlanta with the victorious squad, claiming alleged shoddy treatment from some officials of the Nigerian Football Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere, who has a two-year contract with Nigeria which ends in 1997, had ended his initial protest and flown to the country in August to receive the 1.  5 million naira (about 9,000 U.S. dollars) cash prize promised him by the Nigerian government for the Olympic success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In apparent response to Bonfrere's complaint, the military government effected changes in the composition of Football Association, although independent soccer buffs in Nigeria had always warned that the Dutchman could have a hidden agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This followed the discovery that, under the guise of being on vacation, Bonfrere left Nigeria in August to take up a clandestine two-month contract with the Qatari national team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In effect, the Dutch coach had enjoyed the best of two worlds, at the expense of Nigeria, according to his resignation &quot;on the air&quot; Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere declined to give the reason for quitting the Nigerian job. He simply said &quot;Nigerians know why I am leaving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts say it is illegal for a coach to handle two national teams preparing for the same Fifa competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soccer analysts say Nigeria may require the services of Fifa to bring the Dutchman to book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere's compatriot and former boss, Clemens Westerhof, left Nigeria in a similar fashion after leading the country to its first world cup outing in USA'94.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only difference was that Westerhof, who is now jobless after a dismal stint in South Africa, announced his own resignation from his home in The Netherlands at end of his annual contract.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa's tourism industry, which surged to new record levels in 1995, is declining in 1996 as a direct result of violent crime in the country's major cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest figures released by the Central Statistical Service show that potential foreign visitors, fearful of South Africa's notorious crime rate, have begun to avoid the country in favor of alternative holiday destinations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says that hotel bed nights sold to foreign tourists in August dropped below 183,000, a decrease of more than 6 percent in comparison with the same month in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most severe effect was felt in Johannesburg, regarded as one of the world's crime capitals, where its share of the national market plummeted to little over half of the level held a year ago, from 20 to only 11 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top destination in South Africa remains Cape Town and the surrounding wine regions, with a share of more than 26 percent of bed-nights sold throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following South Africa's first democratic elections in April 1994, the country's tourist industry blossomed, and in 1995 tourist arrivals rocketed by more than 50 percent to over 1.1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was hoped that the boom would continue in 1996, but growing fears over South Africa's mounting crime rate have in fact reversed the trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official police statistics show that the country is one of the world's most crime-ridden societies. A total of just under 2 million serious crimes were reported in the country in 1995, including about 37,000 rapes, 19,000 murders and 67,000 armed robberies. Only half of these crimes have been solved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Tendai Murape, 15, lies groaning on an old canvass mat on the dusty floor of a thatched wooden-pole hut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his gaunt frame almost limp, he is helped to sit and stare at his visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tendai can hardly speak or eat because of a severe infection of the throat and chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mumbles a &quot;thank you&quot; for the soft drinks that his visitors have brought him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His groans have become part of the sounds of this newly-built bush camp on the western slope of Ziruware hill at Madzima village in Musana communal lands, 70 kilometers (44 miles) north of the capital, Harare, in Zimbabwe's Mashonaland central province. Outside, Dorcas, not her real name, a mental patient, sings praises to &quot;Saint Noah&quot;, leader of the Johane Marange apostolic faith sect otherwise known as Noah Momberume. It is based in Eastern Manicaland province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorcas dances, oblivious of the October mid-day heat, the chains and leg irons tying her to a tree and the cries of her sick baby whom she is loath to suckle for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another hut a woman is in labor, while about 10 meters (11 yards) away another patient, Tendai's sister, dozes off under a tree, one of the few moments she can escape the pain that came with complications after she gave birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She too is having problems breast-feeding her newly-born baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the remaining patients of Chitsidzo, as the camp is called by the local members of the purist sect notorious for its total rejection of any form of scientific medication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two others, James Murape and his son, Ishmael, died last week while two weeks earlier. On Sept. 26, the camp lost another patient, Annah Murape, again from the same family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So devastating have been these deaths that some people now call Chitsidzo the &quot;death camp&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the disaster in the Murape family has not shaken the faith or the bareheaded and single-minded resolve of the elders of the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They insist the remaining patients will stay at the camp and will not receive any conventional medication except prayers and water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the thought itself of taking these patients to a hospital or any such institution for treatment is considered a sin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mortuaries are full of dead bodies. There is nothing there that would persuade me to go to hospital. Death is everywhere. We have lost people here just as people have died in hospitals,&quot; said Simon Nzou, an elder (or Rabahuma) of the local church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nzou's words echo those of other sect members spread across Zimbabwe and in neighbouring countries while the deaths in the Murape family are consistent with the tragedies that have hit sect members across the country because of their rejection of modern medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mashonaland Central provincial governor, Border Gezi, recently warned sect members in his province that they risked being arrested if they prevented medical authorities from immunizing their children against child killer diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This followed the deaths of about 10 children of sect members from measles in the northern Muzarabani district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the &quot;apostles&quot; of Madzima village simply hid their children in the mountains, according to the locals, and a few of them were immunized during the recent campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A measles outbreak in Gutu district of Masvingo province two weeks ago claimed the lives of six children believed to have been members of the sect, whose parents also resisted government efforts to have them immunized against child killer diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another incident, Daniel Mashanda of Uzumba-Maramba-Pfungwe district in Mashonaland East lost his four children to measles in 1995 after refusing to have them treated because of his faith in the sect's teachings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later died recently from untreated burns after he refused hospital treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tendai is trapped in the camp and only survives on the hope that the misfortune that struck his family will not return to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining members of his family say he has to stay at the camp. They cannot afford to be heard or even be seen as entertaining the thought of taking Tendai to hospital. Doing so would be an affront to the dignity of their dead father and they might be shunned by other sect members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That decision can only be made by you men,&quot; says Tendai's mother defensively when it is suggested to her that Tendai should be taken to hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His elder brother, William, says hospital will not be necessary because Tendai will definitely heal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A healer specializing in &quot;throat-cleansing&quot; was expected to return this week to cleanse Tendai's throat wounds using salt and vinegar and his bare hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget about anaesthesia, anti-biotics or sterilization of the &quot;surgical instruments&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week's &quot;throat cleansing&quot; was not successful because Tendai says the wounds did not heal, swallowing solid food is still painful and only milk and mineral drinks will do for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the faith healers fails to treat him, as has already happened with three members of his family, Tendai might be staring into a long dark future, unless the authorities rescue him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Nigerian government is giving serious consideration to selling its 57 percent equities in the petroleum sector to private investors, Finance Minister Anthony Ani has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Tuesday in Lagos, at a workshop on &quot;promoting foreign direct investment in Nigeria&quot;, he said the move would aim at maximizing the opportunities in the oil sector, which accounts for at least 80 percent of the country's total foreign exchange earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government, he said, was also willing to grant licenses to competent private investors for the establishment of export-oriented refineries in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government has opened up the gas sector to foreign investment and is willing to consider appropriate tailor-made incentives for private projects in the sector,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry officials have said that the American company, Exxon and the French concern, Total, could emerge as major beneficiaries of the divestment plan for five years from 1997. Divestment could affect six oil prospecting joint ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investment is worth at least 20 billion U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six joint venture partners -- Shell, Mobil, Chevron, Agip, Elf and Texaco -- may not have been officially notified of the planned divestment, industry officials said. But the partners could be preparing to use the opportunity in strengthening their shareholding, one official added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The joint partners held majority interests before the Nigerian government acquisitions from 1971 to 1979 that reversed the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides the blue chips, indigenous entrepreneurs may be offered fiscal incentives to ease their bids for parts of the equity interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At stake is the government's holding on 12 billion barrels of crude oil, or 60 percent of Nigeria's proven oil reserve estimated at 20 billion barrels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of the investment incentives, Ani said that government intended to privatize the country's four refineries after an evaluation of the current value of each of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said there had been heavy investment in the generation of vital information on solid minerals like coal, gypsum, barytes, kaolin and talc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was room, he added, for foreign investors to invest in coal production in the country on their own account or in joint venture projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the unfolding foreign investment drive, private investors are also to enjoy the liberty to use the abundant gas in the country to provide additional energy which could be sold to the National Electric Power Authority or export to other African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government, the minister said, had also opened up the telecommunication sector to private investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Nigeria had decided to privatize a number of state-owned enterprises in order to free the resources tied up in them for other projects.  But the measure, he said, would not throw people out of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly there shall be no job-losses arising from the restructuring of enterprises necessitated by privatization,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead privatization would open the nation's economy for the needed foreign investment, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia's main opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP), headed by former President Kenneth Kaunda, has decided to boycott the Nov. 18 presidential and general elections in protest against the country's new constitution which bars citizens of migrant parents from contesting the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boycott was announced by Kaunda during an emotional press conference in Lusaka, at which he also appealed to other democratic forces within the country to snub what he called President Frederick Chiluba's &quot;sham elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda broke into tears as he berated the Zambian leadership for playing pranks at a time when their countrymen were suffering all sorts of humiliation from poverty and social decay.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UNIP central committee after a thorough examination of the state of the nation and events leading up to the presidential and parliamentary elections set for Nov. 18, has decided that UNIP will not participate in the elections under the current conditions,&quot; said Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We the men and women in UNIP, our supporters, sympathizers and all Zambians who appreciate the value of free, fair and legitimate elections are determined to keep the peace as we fight for our rights and rights of fellow Zambians against the evil perpetrated by the MMD through its manipulation of the constitution and the electoral process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda said that the decision had been taken in pursuit of the party's cherished ideals of love, truth, honesty, social justice and fair play and intended to establish genuine democracy and good governance in peace, honor and integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is generally accepted, he said, that free and fair elections is the only way of forming government that would have the confidence of the people, but pointed out that the current electoral process fell short of this requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the very beginning there has been no consensus whatsoever among the stake-holders on the process and conduct of the 1996 elections. The entire process has been characterized by irregularities that has led to suspicion and lack of public confidence,&quot; alleged Kaunda, who had Malawian parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accused Nikuv, the private Israeli firm, contracted to register voters of mismanaging the entire registration exercise. Only 2.296 million voters were registered out of an estimated 4.6 million eligible voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the new constitution amendments, Kaunda said that it was &quot;a product of extreme bad faith.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not accept that any political party has any rights to impose the constitution on the people of Zambia without their direct consent,&quot; said Kaunda, who charged that President Frederick Chiluba and his party wanted to &quot; hold onto power at all costs&quot; to plunder public resources.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Swedish ambassador to Zambia Anders Johnson has said that the decline in economic of Zambia has severely affected the provision of health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Johnson said constant and persistent budgetary allocations for health care were essential if improved health services, productivity and development was to be realised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Johnson was speaking today in Lusaka when he officially opened a discusion aimed at revealing Zambia health sector expenditure draft report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1995 health expenditure draft report estimated that the nation was spending about K177 billion for health services under the 1995 prices, and was being financed by government, donors, ZCCM, households and missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, the government was only spending about 38 per cent of this total amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report further found that over the past two decades, real government spending on health has been terribly squeezed and noted that the reduced funding has also affected other sectors that are funded by government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, which currently under reveal, however, observed that the ministry of health has increased financial allocations for district health centres from 40 to almost 50 per cent during the last three years, but has reduced the uth and other central hospitals allocation from 32 to 23 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Johnson noted that difficulties in the provision of health services in Zambia had been hampered by the fact that the economic reform efforts had not yet generated the neccessary growth result a situation which had adversely affected government budget and sustainability of health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To alleviate some rigidities in the provision of health services, the ambassador said, there was need for efficiency utilisation of the available resources and need to source for new financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And speaking at the same occasion, head of economics department at the University of Zambia (UNZA) Christopher Mupimpila said that sustainable development in a country could only be realised if there was corresponding developments in economic, social and ecological areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Mupimpila said said economic development without corresponding social development and ecological conservation could not be sustainable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said provision of social services like health and education was imperative if sustainable development was to be achieved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on Tuesday expressed deep concern over the plight of Burundi and Rwandan refugees forced to flee their camps in eastern Zaire in the face of intensified ethnic fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am deeply worried by the widening scale of violence in eastern Zaire in recent weeks that has once again sent tens of thousands of refugees -- women, children, sick and elderly -- fleeing for their lives,&quot; High Commissioner Sadako Ogata said in a statement. &quot;Unless all parties to this conflict step back, we are, I am afraid, heading toward a humanitarian catastrophe.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogata also expressed concern for the safety of humanitarian staff who have been unable to carry out their work because of the fighting between Zairian troops and the Banyamulenge, people of Rwandan origin. As of Tuesday morning, more than 50 international staff members of UNHCR, other U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations were trapped in UNHCR's office in Uvira. Over the last 24 hours, the staff reported they could hear sound of gunfire outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After all our efforts the past few years to provide help and some sense of stability in the Uvira camps in almost impossible conditions, we are once again facing an emergency operation. The refugees and humanitarian workers are at the mercy of a very unstable and dangerous security situation, and it is impossible at this time to predict the outcome. I thus appeal to all sides to halt the violence immediately and avoid another humanitarian disaster in a region that has already suffered enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairian military authorities report that all 12 camps in the Uvira region have been abandoned because of the fighting. The 220,000 refugees from the camps -- 143,000 Burundi and 75,000 Rwandan -- are reported to be either hiding in the surrounding hills or are heading toward Bukavu, about 75 kms north of Uvira. UNHCR field officers have also observed hundreds of local Zaireans moving towards Uvira town, fleeing the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 3,000 refugees have arrived in the Nyengezi-Mulwa camp in the Bukavu region and scores are in Bukavu town itself. UNHCR is preparing existing camps in Bukavu to receive refugee arrivals from Uvira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR field officers expect the Burundi refugees will remain in the Uvira region. Rwandan refugees wishing to return to Rwanda will be assisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Goma region on Sunday, there were military reports of fighting in the vicinity of three camps, leaving one officer dead and another soldier wounded. Reports on the ground indicate that fighting was continuing on Tuesday in at least one area north of Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire hosts 1 million of the 1.6 million Rwandan refugees. The rest are in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome - The World Food Programme today warned that intensified armed fighting and the worsening security situation in eastern Zaire has led to a cut-off in humanitarian supplies which could result in a major hunger crisis affecting over one million Rwandan and Burundian refugees. &quot;Unless supply lines to the refugee camps are opened immediately, the humanitarian consequences in coming weeks could be devastating,&quot; said Trevor Rowe, WFP chief spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our window of opportunity is quickly diminishing as events spiral out of control,&quot; Rowe added. &quot;We appeal to the international community to exert maximum pressure to ensure the free movement of humanitarian relief.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP has the capability to deliver food stocks from neighboring Uganda and Tanzania for the refugees in eastern Zaire for the next two months. However, delivering the food to the camps has become virtually impossible because of worsening security conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until we can move the food into eastern Zaire, we face a situation that is daily growing more tense and more desperate,&quot; Rowe said. &quot;The situation is made more difficult by the fact that thousands of refugees are now on the move and we are unable to reach them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the weekend 75 WFP trucks with more than 2,200 metric tons of food destined for Goma and Bukavu have been halted at the Zaire/Uganda border for security reasons by Zairian authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bukavu, WFP already distributed food supplies to the refugees which will last until the end of the month. The Programme now has only enough additional food stocks to feed the 300,000 refugees for an extra week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Goma, WFP has 7,200 tonnes of food in stock. However, while these supplies are enough to feed 727,000 people for three weeks, delivery has been blocked by continued fighting in the north where an estimated 500,000 refugees are camped. Zairian authorities have not allowed relief personnel to enter the area where food warehouses are located. To the west of Goma, where there are some 22O,000 refugees, there are no food stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to prevent a major crisis in Goma, WFP intends to cut rations in half in order to extend supplies by an additional week. Nonetheless, with the current influx of refugees the amounts of supplies available will be reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main route for delivering food to Goma and Bukavu is from Kampala, Uganda. Food for Bukavu had also been arriving via the now strife-torn Uvira region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Uvira, where up to 250,000 refugees had been living in camps but where most are reported to be on the move, there are no significant food supplies.  Fighting at Uvira between Zairian forces and the Banyamulenge militia has forced a suspension of relief operations. International aid workers from the town were evacuated on a WFP-chartered aircraft on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP is monitoring the situation closely in cooperation with other aid agencies. The Programme is drawing up contingency plans for a number of crisis scenarios in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Food Programme is the largest international food agency. Last year it fed more than 50 million people, including half of the world's refugees and internally displaced people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerians have reacted with indignation to the sudden resignation of their country's soccer coach, Dutchman Johannes Bonfrere, describing it as a national embarrassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bonfrere ought to have been fired long ago for taking Nigeria for a ride,&quot; sports analyst Lance Aribike said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His view is echoed by other soccer fans, who say Nigeria should ignore the Dutchman and concentrate on preparations for international engagements in preparation for World Cup '98 in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soccer buff and image maker of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Tony Ede, said Nigeria should not lose any sleep on Bonfrere's &quot;abscondment.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the country should not let the controversy over the issue impair its preparation for France '98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angus Okoli, veteran journalist and former general manager of Nigeria's mass circulation Daily Times newspaper, agrees, saying the Nigerian Football Association (NFA) should not act &quot;as if Bonfrere's departure&quot; meant the end of football in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let us forget Bonfrere now because in the first place, we would have been campaigning for a World Cup slot even without him,&quot; Okoli added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recalled the case of Bonfrere's predecessor, Clemens Westerhof, who left Nigeria in 1994 and is currently jobless after a dismal stint in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okoli and Aribike believe that any coach worth his name will excel in Nigeria where soccer talents abound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have star professional players in abundance with the result that a good coach will even have a problem of choice,&quot; Aribike added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere landed the Nigerian job --a two-year contract in 1995 -- after his former boss and compatriot, Westerhof, left Nigeria unceremoniously at the end of the 1994 World Cup tournament in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere soon ran into trouble with the Nigeria Football Association, then headed by Emeka Omerua, which accused him of misappropriation of funds involving 10,000 and 25,000 U.S. dollars he was given on separate occasions to prepare the national team for international engagements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutchman denied the allegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, after leading Nigeria's Under-23 squad to win the gold at the centennial Olympic games in Atlanta early this year, Bonfrere failed to return with the team to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went straight home claiming he received shoddy treatment from some NFA officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some Nigerian sports officials insisted the Dutchman had invented the allegation to cover-up the alleged financial impropriety against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere finally flew into Nigeria in September to receive a national honor --Member of the Order of the Niger (MON) -- and 1.5 million naira (some 9,000 U.S. dollars) as reward from the government for the Olympic success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was decorated personally by military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha in a widely publicized ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same Bonfrere announced Wednesday that his resignation from the Nigerian job took effect from August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its reaction, the NFA has said as far as it was concerned, the Dutchman is still its staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not received any letter of resignation from Bonfrere,&quot; the FA said in a statement, adding that the Dutch coach was granted a two-month vacation, which expires at the end of October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had been revealed that since September, Bonfrere has been handling the national team of the Gulf state of Qatar on another contract worth some 25, 000 U.S. dollars a month, contrary to the rules of the world's soccer governing body, FIFA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers suspect that Bonfrere, who is on a monthly pay of 7,500 u.s. dollars in Nigeria might have been lured by the bigger pay package to the Gulf state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official said the NFA is expected to take the case to FIFA if Bonfrere fails to return at the end of October.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Ethiopia's deputy prime minister and minister of defence, Tamirat Layne, has been relieved of his post as of Wednesday, state-run radio announced Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broadcast said he was relieved of his post after the central committee of the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM), stripped him of his post as secretary of the movement during an emergency meeting on Tuesday, for &quot; acting contrary to the principles for which the ANDM had stood during the last 16 years.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broadcast gave no further details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANDM is among the four ethnic-based parties that form the coalition of the ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). The others are the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the Oromo People's Democratic Organization and the South Ethiopia Peoples Alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EPRDF acted swiftly on the decision of the ANDM and accordingly removed Layne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Parliament on its part voted Tafara Walwa, president of the Addis Ababa metropolitan administration to replace Layne. ANDM had played a key role in the armed struggle, spearheaded by the TPLF, to oust the former military dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, in May 1991, after ruling Ethiopia for 17 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As secretary of the ANDM, Layne served as Ethiopia's prime minister during the transitional period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a new federal constitution and the country's first multi-party elections in 1995, he joined the cabinet formed in August the same year under Executive Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, holding the key portfolio of deputy prime minister and minister of defence until the announcement of his removal from office Thursday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerians have reacted with indignation to the sudden resignation of their country's soccer coach, Dutchman Johannes Bonfrere, describing it as a national embarrassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bonfrere ought to have been fired long ago for taking Nigeria for a ride,&quot; sports analyst Lance Aribike said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His view is echoed by other soccer fans, who say Nigeria should ignore the Dutchman and concentrate on preparations for international engagements in preparation for World Cup '98 in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soccer buff and image maker of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Tony Ede, said Nigeria should not lose any sleep on Bonfrere's &quot;abscondment.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the country should not let the controversy over the issue impair its preparation for France '98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angus Okoli, veteran journalist and former general manager of Nigeria's mass circulation Daily Times newspaper, agrees, saying the Nigerian Football Association (NFA) should not act &quot;as if Bonfrere's departure&quot; meant the end of football in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let us forget Bonfrere now because in the first place, we would have been campaigning for a World Cup slot even without him,&quot; Okoli added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recalled the case of Bonfrere's predecessor, Clemens Westerhof, who left Nigeria in 1994 and is currently jobless after a dismal stint in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okoli and Aribike believe that any coach worth his name will excel in Nigeria where soccer talents abound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have star professional players in abundance with the result that a good coach will even have a problem of choice,&quot; Aribike added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere landed the Nigerian job --a two-year contract in 1995 -- after his former boss and compatriot, Westerhof, left Nigeria unceremoniously at the end of the 1994 World Cup tournament in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere soon ran into trouble with the Nigeria Football Association, then headed by Emeka Omerua, which accused him of misappropriation of funds involving 10,000 and 25,000 U.S. dollars he was given on separate occasions to prepare the national team for international engagements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutchman denied the allegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, after leading Nigeria's Under-23 squad to win the gold at the centennial Olympic games in Atlanta early this year, Bonfrere failed to return with the team to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went straight home claiming he received shoddy treatment from some NFA officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some Nigerian sports officials insisted the Dutchman had invented the allegation to cover-up the alleged financial impropriety against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere finally flew into Nigeria in September to receive a national honor --Member of the Order of the Niger (MON) -- and 1.5 million naira (some 9,000 U.S. dollars) as reward from the government for the Olympic success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was decorated personally by military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha in a widely publicized ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same Bonfrere announced Wednesday that his resignation from the Nigerian job took effect from August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its reaction, the NFA has said as far as it was concerned, the Dutchman is still its staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not received any letter of resignation from Bonfrere,&quot; the FA said in a statement, adding that the Dutch coach was granted a two-month vacation, which expires at the end of October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had been revealed that since September, Bonfrere has been handling the national team of the Gulf state of Qatar on another contract worth some 25, 000 U.S. dollars a month, contrary to the rules of the world's soccer governing body, FIFA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers suspect that Bonfrere, who is on a monthly pay of 7,500 u.s. dollars in Nigeria might have been lured by the bigger pay package to the Gulf state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official said the NFA is expected to take the case to FIFA if Bonfrere fails to return at the end of October.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Ethiopia's deputy prime minister and minister of defence, Tamirat Layne, has been relieved of his post as of Wednesday, state-run radio announced Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broadcast said he was relieved of his post after the central committee of the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM), stripped him of his post as secretary of the movement during an emergency meeting on Tuesday, for &quot; acting contrary to the principles for which the ANDM had stood during the last 16 years.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broadcast gave no further details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANDM is among the four ethnic-based parties that form the coalition of the ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). The others are the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the Oromo People's Democratic Organization and the South Ethiopia Peoples Alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EPRDF acted swiftly on the decision of the ANDM and accordingly removed Layne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Parliament on its part voted Tafara Walwa, president of the Addis Ababa metropolitan administration to replace Layne. ANDM had played a key role in the armed struggle, spearheaded by the TPLF, to oust the former military dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, in May 1991, after ruling Ethiopia for 17 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As secretary of the ANDM, Layne served as Ethiopia's prime minister during the transitional period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a new federal constitution and the country's first multi-party elections in 1995, he joined the cabinet formed in August the same year under Executive Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, holding the key portfolio of deputy prime minister and minister of defence until the announcement of his removal from office Thursday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ceremony was attended by defence chiefs, ministers and government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the ceremony, First Brigade of the Zambia Army chaplain, Major James Phiri said freedom was a duty and responsibility with a claim of justice to the demands of rightful law, governance and guidance of legitimate authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later President Chiluba said that he will not allow the subversion of democracy by individualswhose political agenda is at variance with the wishes of many Zambians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President said elections and the ballot, form the basis of any democracy and therefore no single person should be allowed to defranchise citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The vote is the one vital and cardinal attribute that differentiates a democracy from a dictatorship, I will defend the right to vote, even if the vote is against my party,' Mr Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking at State House during independence day celebrations attended by government leaders, diplomats, party cadres and some members of the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday UNIP president, Kenneth Kaunda, said that his party was boycotting the forthcoming elections and that he would go flat out to discourage voters in the country to take part in the electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But President Chiluba described the move as hypocritical and totally immoral for an indivindual who has not even registered as a voter to deny registerd voters their right to vote by invoking individual grievances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said responsible leaders should build a society and promote a climate that encourages people to exercise their rights as citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is neither responsible nor patriotic to rob registered voters of their vote,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba said however, that he is aware that the reforms that MMD embarked upon have exacted a toll on the people but that the pain endured should not undermine national stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said every Zambian must assume a personal responsibility to safeguard the country from destructive force saying exmple abound in Africa where selfish political interests have plunged countries into violence and bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kabwe, Mayor James Chansa, has condemned the recent riots that rocked the town after President Chiluba announced that ougoing central member of parliament, Mr Paul Tembo will recontest the seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a brief flag hosting ceremony to mark this year's independence day celebrations held at the civic centre early this morning, Mr Chansa said the hooliganism exhibited by some MMD candidates last week was not only embarassing but uncalled for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged MMD supporters in the area to refrain from acts of violence that would disrupt the peace the nation was enjoying, saying last Saturday's incident should not happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is unwarranted in a peaceful town like Kabwe, we should remain as peacefula s ever,&quot; Mr Chansa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chansa who is Highridge MMD ward councillor also appealed to residents to jealously guard Zambia's hard won independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Solwezi,it was disclosed that fifteen chiefs out of thirty-one in North- Western province have benefitted from the direct funding from President Chiluba for the rehabilitation of palaces.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I appeal to all political players especially Dr. Kenneth Kaunda who is the most experienced politician to maintain peace for the benefit of the people of Zambia, &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mung'omba further appealed to the new independent electoral commission to ensure that all registered voters in the country are given a chance to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ndola as the date for the presidential and parliamentary elections draws nearer, Mayor Fidelis Kangwa appealed to residents in the town who registered as voters to collect their cards in readiness for the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kangwa who was speaking at Musa Kasonka stadium during celebrations to mark the 32nd independence anniversary said those who have collected their voters'cards should check for their names on the final roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kangwa said this year's anniversary was special in that it came at a time when parliament has been dissolved and all Zambians who are eligible voters prepare to go to the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we celebrate today we should refelct on where we have come from and where we are now,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He observed that experience the Zambians have gone through has enabled them to be in command of their destiny especially given the enabling environment that exists now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - UNIP, Zambia's leading opposition party, has decided not to participate in the next month's presidential and general elections &quot;under the current conditions&quot; and appealed to all its &quot;supporters and all peace loving Zambians not to cast their votes in this sham elections&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda told a press conference at Lusaka's Pamodzi Hotel yesterday that after a thorough examination of the events leading up to the elections UNIP has decided not to participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United National Independence Party (UNIP) Central Committee, after a thorough examination of the state of our nation and the events leading up to the presidential and parliamentary elections set for November 18, 1996 has decided that UNIP will not participate in the elections under the current conditions,&quot; president Kaunda told a press conference which was attended by most diplomats based in Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ruling MMD national chairman, Sikota Wina, assured that UNIP's boycott &quot; will not affect the timetable for the elections&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wina, without analysing the similarities and differences of the circumstances, said this was not the first time in Africa the opposition was boycotting elections and urged Zambians to turn up in numbers to cast their votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda declared that he would with immediate effect mount a massive campaign to urge Zambians not to cast their votes to legitimatise the government of President Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of us will be on tour to tell the people about their plight. UNIP candidates will be in all provinces campaigning that their will be no voting,&quot; Kaunda said. &quot; Then this government will fall in the next 3-6 months, that is if there will be elections at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ZDC president Dean Mung'omba, at a separate meeting in Lusaka yesterday, said president Kaunda had made a wrong decision to boycott the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mung'omba claimed that ZDC had carried out consultations with the people of Zambia who urged them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not to boycott the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boycotting elections is not the best solution. We consulted with SADC member countries and the international community and other partners who said the best was to meet Chiluba is at the polls,&quot; Mung'omba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that UNIP should have consulted other opposition parties before deciding to go it alone to boycott the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore there won't be boycotting,&quot; Mung'omba said. &quot; I find it very difficult to take any other decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Civic Education Association (ZCEA) chairperson, Lucy Sichone, said her organisation supported the decision by UNIP on &quot;principle&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sichone warned that her association will physically disrupt the elections if the government attempted to go ahead under the current conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No election will take place on the basis of the Nikuv registers,&quot; Sichone said in an interview last night. &quot;We want the entire thing to be declared null and void. No Zambians should legitimise the whole process going to the polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) described the decision by UNIP as a blow to the democratic process in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMT board secretary, Gershom Musonda, noted that what happened was a &quot; clear manifestation of the frustration UNIP has gone through at the hands of the MMD&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;UNIP was the strongest opponent to MMD. In the absence of UNIP we are now ready to enter into a dictatorship,&quot; Musonda warned</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A fresh threat from Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to frustrate the attachment of assets of politically influential debtors is causing concern among the country's financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was carried in Monday's Business Day newspaper of South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the burial of Simon Muzazenhamo, who died of a heart attack before creditors could foreclose, President Mugabe made a fresh attack on the country's 70,000 whites and alleged they were responsible for the inhuman policies of banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why should we even keep such people in our institutions at all?&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were oppressors yesterday, they are still oppressors today of the liberated people. Where is our freedom if institutions meant to assist our people are destroying them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He singled out prominent banker Brian Bostock, agri-business manager for the state controlled Zimbabwe Banking Corporation.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbank general manager, Sigaboliso Biya, has not commented on Mugabe's attack on Bostock and the policies of the bank, in which the parastatal reserve bank has a controlling interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Medical specialists have advised government to ensure that great care is taken when privatising Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines health utilities as they contributed a great deal to the country's health sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a draft on the study of Health Sector Expenditure Review prepared jointly by the Swedish Institute for Health Economics, the University of Zambia (UNZA) department of economics and the Ministry of Health advised the government to exercise caution when privatising ZCCM's health utilities so that they are taken over in the most cost effective way by the buyers, by other companies and other private sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ZCCM is in the pipeline of being privatised. At present, they account for 12 per cent of the total financing of the health sector, which is a substantial part. As they account for such a large part of health financing in Zambia great care must be taken when privatising the company,&quot; the draft report further read.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the financial contribution rating contained in the report, government accounts for 38 per cent of the health sector financing, followed by the donors' 36 per cent while ZCCM is third at 12 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining section is financed by the households (through chemists) accounting for 10 per cent, followed by other companies at two per cent and lastly at one per cent for missions and non-governmental organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government funding for the health sector, despite having risen in monetary terms by 14 per cent this year, recorded a decrease in real terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The US$20 per capita was spent on health during 1995, out of which approximately US$7.3 came from the government,has however dropped to US$18 this year due to depreciation of the kwacha,&quot; the report further read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And speaking in an interview at the presentation of a draft at the Swedish Embassy yesterday, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines group medical services manager, Garvin Silomba, admitted that there was uncertainty over what will happen to the mines health institutions when the mining conglomerate is privatised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its difficult to state whether the investors will want to run the hospitals and health facilities or they may only want to deal with the mines,&quot; Silomba said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study also showed that a large proportion amounting to over 62 per cent of private spending is spent drugs which accounts for six per cent of health care spending.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le-Reduit, Mauritius - African governments have been urged to consider Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) as partners in development and not competitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights executive director, Zoe Tembo, told Mauritian President Cassam Uteem that NGOs played a very significant role in the development of any nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembo, a Zambian heading the Gambian-based Pan African institution, said when her group paid a courtesy call on President Uteem at State House yesterday that her organisation was working towards bridging the gap between governments and NGOs on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What the organisation is doing is to ensure that the government and NGO officials are trained so that both realise that they have a role to play in the affairs of their countries and that they are fighting for the same cause,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembo noted that governments tended to be suspicious of NGOs and regard them as trouble makers because of the foreign funding that most of them get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembo said more seminars were needed to educate both sides to minimise unnecessary suspicions and fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembo, who is attending the 20th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights, however, observed that NGOs also tended to view themselves as institutions that were fighting governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Uteem told the delegation that his government appreciated the role of the NGOs and that they would continue to encourage them in their tasks and urged them to pressurise the government and suggest the best course to take on issues relating to human rights in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently the Zambian government threatened to ban some NGOs while Vice- President Godfrey Miyanda told Parliament that his government would start regulating the activities of some of the organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accused them of not following their constitutions and disrupting some government programmes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia's Catholic bishops yesterday, in a pastoral letter, said constructive dialogue on issues like the Constitution, the Electoral Act and voters registration should be encouraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops also urged political parties to keep their campaigns pertinent to issues that are important to the people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an elections pastoral letter released yesterday, the bishops said important issues such as service to the poor, social welfare, agricultural policy or economic recovery should be addressed and issues which may be insulting to their opponents and not promote peaceful elections be avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All parties should have equal access to the publicly owned media which has the duty of reporting political campaigns fairly and accurately,&quot; the letter reads in part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their letter, the bishops called upon the government and the ruling party to realise that they have a serious responsibility to ensure that the concerns of all key players are adequately addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops also advised the opposition parties to be open and constructive in participating in the electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of Zambia are urged to be intelligent and responsible voters, informing themselves of the manifestos of the various political parties,&quot; the letter reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops have said the qualities needed by candidates seeking political office are professional competence, courage to speak out the truth, concern for social justice and desire to work for the common good instead of self- enrichment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have also expressed the need to have transparency in the organisation of the elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - President Paul Biya of Cameroon told the General Assembly this afternoon that, as current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), he had been instructed by it to undertake the necessary contacts to ensure a second term for Africa at the head of the United Nations, with Boutros Boutros-Ghali as the OAU candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his address to the Assembly, President Biya also said that the regional mechanism for the settlement of disputes established by OAU members in 1993 had become the paramount mechanism of preventive diplomacy in the region.  However, in order to flourish, regional initiatives must receive adequate material and technical support. He stressed that for Africa, peace was an absolute requirement, so that all of the continent's resources could be committed to development.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Biya said the members of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) had met in July and confirmed their support for the re-election of Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. The President said that he had been instructed by the OAU to undertake the necessary contacts to ensure a second term for Africa at the head of the United Nations, with Boutros Boutros-Ghali as the OAU candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuing, the President said the regional mechanism for the settlement of disputes established by OAU members in 1993 had become the paramount mechanism of preventive diplomacy in the region. However, in order to flourish, regional initiatives must receive adequate material and technical support. In Africa, conflicts within and between States continued. In Angola, peace must be reinforced. Hopes for the return to normalcy in Burundi called for dialogue between all parties and a return to constitutional order. In Rwanda, he welcomed the trial of those suspected of genocide by the International Tribunal for Rwanda, meeting in Arusha, United Republic of Tanzania. The border dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria also continued. His Government had brought the matter before the OAU, the Security Council and the International Court of Justice, in hope of finding a peaceful settlement.  The international community must continue to support the peace-keeping efforts of the Economic Community of West African States' Monitoring Observer Group (ECOMOG).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Africa, peace was an absolute requirement, he said. Peace was necessary so that all of Africa's resources could be committed to development. Africa needed peace to promote democracy, economic development and to build the rule of law. The democratic process must be supported and protected against sectarianism, violence and extremism. Without peace, without development there could be no democracy. Africa was indeed the least developed continent and the most affected by economic crisis. Africa, vulnerable to economic changes, was enduring a widespread tendency towards disinvestment. To ensure stability, increased support from the international community was vital.  Programmes, particularly under the encouragement of the United Nations, had been undertaken in support of Africa. Significant resources must be mobilized by the international community to ensure that the programmes were successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called for the revitalization of the United Nations. Equitable geographic representation on the Security Council must be achieved, as must a strengthening of the role of the General Assembly in maintaining international peace, security and cooperation, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The information in this report is current as of early this morning (26 October 1996). An evacuation of international aid staff from Bukavu is likely today. The situation is very fluid, and events may overtake this report over the next hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. THE WIDENING CONFLICT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 The conflict in South Kivu is reaching a peak as the provincial capital, Bukavu, is squeezed by military advances from the south and land routes for aid and trade are blocked. An attack on Bukavu is regarded by the Zairean Camp Security Contingent as within the capacity of the Banyamulenge-dominated forces at any time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Despite urgings (and even appeals for contributions for the war effort) from the Zairean Prime Minister and President, it appears clear that the FAZ are losing territory and retreating, sometimes even before engaging the rebels. Zairean forces have been pushed back beyond Nyangezi, less than 30 kms south of Bukavu, where some 10 Zairean Camp Security Contingent soldiers were captured mid-week. The Banyamulenge-dominated forces opposing them now control most of the area between Uvira and Buakvu, including Kamanyola and part, if not all of the border with Rwanda. Zairean forces occupying Uvira have apparently been defeated by the rebels during Friday night and Saturday morning after shelling was reported on the night of the 24th October and in the morning of the 25th. BBC carried an interview with a spokesman for the &quot; Alliance of Forces for Democracy and Liberation of Congo-Zaire&quot;, who claimed to be in Uvira, having won the town with a force of 400 fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 The FAZ have mounted roadblocks in Bukavu city for checking identification papers and the number of car-jackings by Zairean soldiers is high - 10-15 UN and NGO vehicles were seized on Tuesday alone. While the Governor declared himself &quot;serene&quot; earlier in the week, the FAZ have reportedly set up defensive positions around the city. A 8pm to 6am curfew was enforced on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 While the Banyamulenge forces control most of the Rusizi plain and probably parts of the Haut Plateaux in the west, some observers expressed surprise that they had climbed the escarpment road and taken highland areas around Nyangezi on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 The ultimate objective of the Banyamulenge-dominated forces is unclear, as the conflict obstensibly began as an exercise in self-defence. The possibility of some kind of &quot;master-plan&quot; linking attacks in North Kivu and the South Kivu conflict is hard to discount entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.6 Zairean state radio announced that military aircraft are to be deployed in the South Kivu conflict. Further ammunition was supplied to the FAZ during the week. Accusations and denials continue to fly between Kinshasa and Kigali as to the alleged involvement of Rwandan Patriotic Army forces in the fighting. Zaire has also protested to the UN Security Council. There remains no conclusive evidence of RPA involvement nor of Burundian forces taking part.  Other allegations include reports of anti-Zairean forces using Burundian and Rwandan territory in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.7 Prompt diplomatic initiatives by the EU, UN and OAU have yet to bear fruit but talks hosted by Belgium have started in an attempt to broker a meeting between Zairean Prime Minster Kengo wa Dondo and either Rwandan Prime Minister Pierre Celestin Rwigema or Vice President and Minister of Defence, Paul Kagame. The US, France and EU Special Envoy have lent weight to Belgian efforts. The UN Secretary-General and the Chairman of the OAU, have lent their support to the idea of a regional Conference for Peace, Security and Development in the Great Lakes Region. UN Special Envoy, Ibrahima Fall, is reported to have made progress in persuading Uganda and Rwanda of the usefulness of the Conference. The UN Secretary-General has further proposed a mediator to negotiate a ceasefire. Zairean President Mobutu is reported to remain in very poor health in Switzerland, adding to the general uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.8 Opposition groups from Rwanda (the RDR) and Burundi (CNDD) have weighed in with statements alleging an over-arching plan for a &quot;Tutsiland&quot; beyond the borders of Rwanda and Burundi. Muller Ruhimbika, exiled Banyamulenge leader of the newly-named Democratic Alliance for the People, said that Shaba and Kasai-based Zairean opposition groups now support the Tutsi rebels. This raises the possibility of an even broader conflict within Zaire. Also the Banyamulenge were ready for talks, he said in a BBC interview on Thursday. On Friday, he upped the stakes by saying to &quot;We are not fighting for the Kivu region, but for the whole of Zaire ... Mobutu must go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.9 The widening conflict in North Kivu includes border areas between Uganda and Zaire. Uganda's Major-General Salim Saleh, Special Presidential Advisor on Military and Political Affairs in the North has asked parliament to allow government Ugandan People's Defence Forces to pursue and assault bases of Ugandan rebels in Zaire and Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. HUMANITARIAN IMPACT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 As the crisis broke, all 220,000 refugees grouped in the Uvira camps were reported to all have fled. Now, however, it appears that some camps remian more or less intact and the refugees are still in residence. Those that were abandoned have since reportedly been burnt. As far as anyone can tell, four or five camps to the north of Uvira are the ones which have been abandoned. Figures being used by the humanitarian community in Bukavu indicate that there are up to 80,000 mainly Rwandan refugees from the Uvira camps on the move. But some refugees from the Uvira camps have reportedly fled westwards - and some may have returned to Burundi. Since the deterioration in security and the evacuation of relief workers, as many as 140,000 refugees may remain around Uvira and are unlikely to receive any supplies in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 The second group of affected people are the refugees of the southern Bukavu camps, in particular the two at Nyangezi. A total of 37,000 refugees from those two camps left beginning Tuesday 22 October. In addition, it appears that Nyantende camp may also be abandoned (approximately 9,000 more &quot; displaced refugees&quot; may have moved out).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 The third group of affected people are local Zairean populations displaced by the fighting. In the whole of South Kivu, a current &quot;guesstimate&quot; of the numbers suggests 15,000 displaced in Fizi Zone, south of Uvira, 30, 000 between Uvira and Bukavu and 10,000 in the environs of Bukavu. Some urban Zaireans in Uvira and Bukavu are also leaving town to seek sanctuary in the countryside. These figures are little better than guesses, and needs among this group are likely to be talken care of by relatives. However, the strain of accomodating displaced family members will, in the medium term, begin to take a toll on local services in health and other sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital in Bukavu is full, with wounded soldiers still armed, causing disruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. BREAKDOWN OF POPULATION IN NEED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 Table of current population estimates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Displaced refugees (frm Uvira): 80,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Displaced refugees (from Bukavu): 46,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remaining refugees (at Bukavu): 264,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remaining refugees (at Uvira): 140,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total: 530,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 Additional non-food needs are likely for Zairean displaced in the mid- term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 Up to 16,000 of the estimated displaced refugees from both areas listed above have re-appeared at other Bukavu camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.4 These figures shoiuld of course be treated wiuth caution, as they are &quot; best available&quot; estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 The activities of humanitarian agencies are severly restricted by looting of vehicles in the town, the possibility of ambushes outside and the threat of a rebel assault on the town. WFP had a warehouse looted on Wednesday and a staff member assaulted on Thursday. It is questionable whether the current level of insecurity can be tolerated by the majority of aid agencies, and a planned pull-out is being reviewed constantly. Within these limitations, aid agencies are trying to assist the displaced refugees on arrival at the Bukavu camps, continue services to established refugees and give some support to local structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 The displaced refugees are beginning to arrive in westerly Bukavu camps, giuded by Zairean soldiers along the route. This group are - in general - prevented from entering Bukavu by Zairean security forces. As many of the Bukavu camps are effectively &quot;full&quot; (no unused or suitable land is adjacent), UNHCR is encouraging those who wish to stay, to move to emptier camps, and Chimanga in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.3 Chimanga, managed by CARE, is the most westerly of the Bukavu camps, and had a population of about 18,000 before the crisis broke. So far, about 2, 000 displaced refugees have arrived there. Larger numbers of refugees (7,000- 14,000) have arrived at camps along the route, but protest at having to move further. They are building shelters on the edges of the current camps, and are accepted by the other refugees. Aid agencies are planning to porvide water and high-protein biscuits along the road if security permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.4 The UNHCR, however, has urged the Rwandan refugees to seriously consider retunrning home in a message from Ms Ogata braodcast to the region on 25 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. HUMANITARIAN IMPLICATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.1 The current land routes to Bukavu seem likely to be closed or unreliable for the near future. If the roads to Uganda, north of Goma become safer, Bukavu could then be supplied by barge from Goma. The road between the two provincial capitals is unsuitable for any truck carrying more than 10 metric tonnes, and even then it is a rough road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.2 The southern route through Uvira (itself supplied either by barge from Kigoma, Tanzania, or in the past, overland through Burundi) seems likely to be closed for some time unless there is a resolution to the fighting one way or the other. There are alternative land routes - through Rwanda, but since April 1995, the Rwandan Government has blocked the transit of refugee relief supplies through its territory. On its past record, it would be surprising if Rwanda were to relent now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.3 Monthly food requirements for the 310,000 refugees of the Bukavu caseload plus the additional displaced refugees from Uvira could be over 6, 000 metric tonnes per month. The World Food Programme intends to operate an airlift from Uganda to Bukavu, using a C-130 transport aircraft. The first flight of food was planned for Saturday, carrying nutritional biscuits or CSB.  However, the supply of the current caseload in South Kivu with a general raytion would be prohibitively expensive. An attempt to supply even a half ration by air could cost well over $100,000 oer day. A single C-130 flight from Entebbe to Bukavu costs between $12,000 to $15,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.4 Other relief items may be deliverable by barge from stock in Goma, but in general, further supplies will have to come by air. However, Bukavu airport is a 40-minute drive north of the town and so is vulnerable to being cut off too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.5 The delivery of food and other relief items to Bukavu is only one part of the story. If Bukavu remains cut off, the effects of a de facto blockade will begin to show in fuel shortages, inflation and perhaps additional population displacement and looting. Diesel is already in very short supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.6 The contortions required to &quot;classify&quot; the affected populations in South Kivu are one aspect of the humanitarian system's sometimes overlapping mandates: refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and recipients of &quot; development aid&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.7 The UNHCR message urges Rwandan refugees to make a virtue of a necessity, and go home where their security and dignity are assured by the Rwandan government and attested to by the international community. While reassuring them that the choice is theirs, in a &quot;terrible&quot; situation, UNHCR urges them to ignore &quot;malicious rumours&quot; when deciding where to go. If the rebels control the southern land border between Rwanda and Zaire, however, there may not presently be a safe corridor for refugees willing to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.1 Reliable information on the number and location of the displaced and refugees of all groups is very scarce. Also, details of the progress of the fighting is almost non-existent. The few foreign journalists in Bukavu are constantly harrassed and asked for bribes. A foreign correspondent (with a valid visa) leaving Bukavu on Friday had to pay a total of $500 in bribes at seven checkpoints along the airport road and at the airport itself. Another journalist, fully accredited with Kinshasa was locked up overnight earlier in the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.2 The size, composition and location of rebel forces is also hard to confirm. Even displaced refugees interviewed at Nyamirangwe could not report actually seeing rebel troops. Several camp populations made decisions to move on hearing shooting or after the Zairean troops pulled out. They do not seem to have fled in panic in disarray, but rather with trepidation, planning and forethought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.3 While the situation for the displaced refugees appears precarious, the needs of the remaining Uvira caseload (mainly Burundian Hutus) may in fact be greater and more urgent, given their location near the centre of the conflict, and the complete absence of international aid or monitoring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.4 Insecurity may increase in Bukavu, either from a direct attack, or a breakdown in discipline by already jumpy Zairean troops, and trigger an evacuation of aid workers. Already, armed soldiers are paid by agencies when moving around the city, but car-jackings continue. Soldiers are sometimes reported to want the cars to move themselves and their families out of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.5 Humanitarian agencies should continue to seek access to populations in need, and insist on their impartiality, and state their intentions and modus operandi clearly and publicly. However, given the experience of aid agencies in Uvira, it may be impossible in the short term to deliver even basic life- saving services in South Kivu. The principle of maintaining a joint approach to evacuation and/or suspension of activites among the UN agencies and partners seems well-established. External assessment missions (a two-man French team arrived Friday from Paris) will no doubt proliferate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.6 Options open to humanitarian agencies are extremely limited. The current crisis is a &quot;litmus test&quot; of the willingness of Rwandan refugees to return home. The humanitarian community may wish to consider ways to guarantee safe corridors for the refugees to reach Rwanda. For the displaced refugees in South Kivu, there is no easy route to the Rwandan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.7 The real crisis is not about refugees - they, in the widening conflict, are both a symptom and a cause of the problems of the Great Lakes. The status of the Banyamulenge has been an issue for at least 200 years, but the arrival of Burundian and Rwandan refugees over the last three years - caused by internal conflicts - has brought the Banyamulenge's predicament to a climax, and potentially drawn others into the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.8 Eastern Zaire - lush, fertile and well-watered, is now the theatre of many unresolved regional political problems. The widening conflict, unless cooled by talks, external military intervention or ceasefire has the potential to generate a new spiral of crises, putting more and more civilian populations at risk, and at worst, breaking into full-scale war.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - President Nelson Mandela has denied newspaper reports that he is to resign as South Africa's Head of State over party and government differences on economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential Spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Thursday that Mandela had not threatened to quit if his party, the African National Congress, failed to support his government's macro- economic plan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mankahlana said Mandela would not resign as either the party spot or as President of South Africa, thereby risk driving the nation toward instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Mandela would push through, the government's controversial economic policy. Although details were still open for discussion, Mankahlana said, the principles of the strategy were not negotiable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not in the president's nature to deal with matters of national concern in a way that prioritises his personal feelings,&quot; Mankahlana added. &quot; We find it strange that there will still be people who, when they come across a rumor of this kind, will not sit back and question whether this is the kind of judgment that would be compatible with President Mandela.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Mandela's recent announcement that he would not be available for re-election in 1997 as A.N.C. president was proof that his main concern was to conduct matters of state in a way which would ensure national stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That announcement -- made earlier in the year -- was not, Mankahlana said, related to the refusal by certain A.N.C. party members to the government's macro-economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new A.N.C. president will be elected at the 1997 annual congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mandela will remain President of South African until the 1999 general elections but will not be available for a second term of this office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi (PANA) - The 90 days Maj. Pierre Buyoya has spent as Burundian head of state have been marked by daily violence against a background of severe economic sanctions imposed by neighbouring countries to force the military regime to &quot;restore constitutional legality&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 162 million U.S. dollars have been lost in the economic sector, according to figures from the country's prime minister, and at least 10,000 civilians have been killed since the July 25 coup, according to various sources, including Amnesty International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The short tenure of office of Burundi's new strongman has also been marked by political deadlock, despite concrete measures aimed at improving the local socio-political climate and the lifting of the sanctions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya agreed to the international community's request to restore political parties and the national assembly on Sept. 13, while maintaining the suspension of the constitution which provides that in case of a vacancy at the presidency, the national assembly speaker should be in charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A decree establishing the three-year transition was also signed by Buyoya in early September, which meant there is no question of going back to the old constitution and no handing over power to the majority party, the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This explains the reluctance of FRODEBU and the international community to endorse Buyoya's action. FRODEBU is thus refusing to sit in parliament in the absence of the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The embargo has been maintained by the regional states. But the prime minister announced the refusal by the government to negotiate with the armed opposition prior to the lifting of the embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This toughening of Burundi's position led the neighbouring countries to send their foreign ministers to Bujumbura on Oct. 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government statement then &quot;commended the contact&quot; and expressed the hope that &quot;the unjust and illegal sanctions&quot; would be lifted swiftly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi will closely follow developments in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, where a new summit is to be held Nov. 12 by heads of states who imposed the sanctions on Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, new developments in the sub-region, including the war between the Banyamurenge (Zairean Tutsi of Rwandan origin) and the Zairean army in eastern Zaire, may further complicate the situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Some 30 students from Kampala's Makerere University were arrested Thursday and 35 others dismissed following a battle with police over the closure of a hall of residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The skirmishes flared after police fired tear gas to disperse students who had converged at the campus' Freedom Square to demonstrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cloud of tear gas enveloped the campus as a combined force of some 100 anti-riot and regular police as well as local defence forces stormed the crowd. Dozens of students were injured.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the dismissals and arrests, the University Council ordered the rioting students to report for classes or face expulsion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those not reporting should regard themselves as having dismissed themselves from the university forthwith. Furthermore, any student who attempts to stop others from attending classes shall be dismissed forthwith,&quot; the council said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the students dismissed were the guild president, Remmy Galogitho, and many of the student leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closure of Northcote Hall, at the beginning of the academic year early October, followed failure by the university to identify students who, in May, put pieces of broken glass into food meant for students in the nearby Africa and Livingstone halls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A disciplinary committee chaired by a high court judge was instituted to investigate the matter but it failed to identify the culprits. Then, the university ordered the 720 students of the self-styled &quot;military state&quot; to become non-residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the university has been besieged by the police for a week, a large assembly of students eluded the security detail Wednesday to forcefully open the doors of Northcote Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doors and windows were flung open after students broke into the hall and later lit a bonfire in front of the hall. The university administration had declared the hall off limits to students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a strike by health workers in Uganda which started Tuesday over higher pay is slowly spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wards in Mulago Referral Hospital in Kampala were deserted by Friday except a skeleton staff handling emergencies. Strikers are demanding 900,000 Uganda shillings (900 U.S. dollars) monthly for doctors and 175,000 shillings (175 dollars) for support staff. Doctors currently earn 174,000 shillings (174 dollars) a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second time in two years that health workers have gone on strike over higher pay. In September 1995, the government persuaded the striking workers to resume duty after promising to look into their grievances.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - The Mozambican and United States governments signed Thursday in Maputo an agreement that will give Mozambique access to the internet communications system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the agreement, signed by Mozambican Transport Minister Paulo Muxanga and the director of the Maputo office of the United States Agency for International Development, George Wachtenheim, complete and quick access to internet will be available in Maputo within six months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system will be available in other major Mozambican cities within a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The installation of internet in Mozambique is part of the 'Leland Initiative', launched by U.S. Vice President Al Gore in 1995. Mozambique is the 4th African country to enter the Worldwide Web through this initiative.  According to Wachtenheim, eventually 20 African countries will benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the agreement, USAID will provide a parabolic antenna and a direct link to the United States at a low cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wacthenheim said that USAID will support all efforts to extend the internet to the largest possible number of users, be they individuals or groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the months to come, we will provide technical assistance to identify and overcome hindrances to the quick expansion of the new technology, and will identify potential applications of the internet in the development of Mozambique,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United Nations, (PANA) - Cameroon is committed to a peaceful settlement of its dispute with Nigeria over the Bakassi Peninsula, President Paul Biya has told the United National General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the beginning, we have given precedence to the approach of dialogue and a peaceful settlement of the dispute by bringing the matter before the OAU, the Security Council and the International Court of Justice at the Hague, &quot; Biya said while addressing the assembly in New York Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Cameroon would accept the decision of the court &quot;as it is appropriate.&quot; Both neighbors have clashed repeatedly over the oil-rich peninsula in the Gulf of Guinea, since 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya, who is also the chairman of the OAU (Organization of African Unity), said the numerous conflicts in Africa -- in Somalia, Sudan, Liberia, Angola and Burundi, among others -- were having devastating consequences for the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facing so many acute problems today, Africa has to see peace as an absolute requirement,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya said although africa was moving along the road to democracy and to the construction of the state of law, poverty was posing the most serious threat to its efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa is indeed the least developed continent,&quot; he told the assembly,&quot; adding: &quot;it is also the most affected by the disastrous effect of economic crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU chairman listed a number of measures which could help to change the fortunes of the continent, including an increase in the flow of private and public resources to the continent, debt reduction and facilitating access for Africa's exports to the world market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He praised Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his &quot;tireless efforts&quot; for the U.N.  and for peace, and re-stated the position of the OAU that he should be re- elected for a second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The heads of state and government of countries that are members of the OAU met last july in Yaounde and reconfirmed their trust in him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We trust that the members of our organization will thus enable Africa to hold two successive terms at the head of the U.N. just as in the past Asia, Europe and Latin America did,&quot; Biya added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - President Nelson Mandela has denied newspaper reports that he is to resign as South Africa's Head of State over party and government differences on economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential Spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Thursday that Mandela had not threatened to quit if his party, the African National Congress, failed to support his government's macro- economic plan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mankahlana said Mandela would not resign as either the party spot or as President of South Africa, thereby risk driving the nation toward instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Mandela would push through, the government's controversial economic policy. Although details were still open for discussion, Mankahlana said, the principles of the strategy were not negotiable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not in the president's nature to deal with matters of national concern in a way that prioritises his personal feelings,&quot; Mankahlana added. &quot; We find it strange that there will still be people who, when they come across a rumor of this kind, will not sit back and question whether this is the kind of judgment that would be compatible with President Mandela.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Mandela's recent announcement that he would not be available for re-election in 1997 as A.N.C. president was proof that his main concern was to conduct matters of state in a way which would ensure national stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That announcement -- made earlier in the year -- was not, Mankahlana said, related to the refusal by certain A.N.C. party members to the government's macro-economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new A.N.C. president will be elected at the 1997 annual congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mandela will remain President of South African until the 1999 general elections but will not be available for a second term of this office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi (PANA) - The 90 days Maj. Pierre Buyoya has spent as Burundian head of state have been marked by daily violence against a background of severe economic sanctions imposed by neighbouring countries to force the military regime to &quot;restore constitutional legality&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 162 million U.S. dollars have been lost in the economic sector, according to figures from the country's prime minister, and at least 10,000 civilians have been killed since the July 25 coup, according to various sources, including Amnesty International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The short tenure of office of Burundi's new strongman has also been marked by political deadlock, despite concrete measures aimed at improving the local socio-political climate and the lifting of the sanctions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya agreed to the international community's request to restore political parties and the national assembly on Sept. 13, while maintaining the suspension of the constitution which provides that in case of a vacancy at the presidency, the national assembly speaker should be in charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A decree establishing the three-year transition was also signed by Buyoya in early September, which meant there is no question of going back to the old constitution and no handing over power to the majority party, the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This explains the reluctance of FRODEBU and the international community to endorse Buyoya's action. FRODEBU is thus refusing to sit in parliament in the absence of the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The embargo has been maintained by the regional states. But the prime minister announced the refusal by the government to negotiate with the armed opposition prior to the lifting of the embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This toughening of Burundi's position led the neighbouring countries to send their foreign ministers to Bujumbura on Oct. 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government statement then &quot;commended the contact&quot; and expressed the hope that &quot;the unjust and illegal sanctions&quot; would be lifted swiftly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi will closely follow developments in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, where a new summit is to be held Nov. 12 by heads of states who imposed the sanctions on Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, new developments in the sub-region, including the war between the Banyamurenge (Zairean Tutsi of Rwandan origin) and the Zairean army in eastern Zaire, may further complicate the situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Some 30 students from Kampala's Makerere University were arrested Thursday and 35 others dismissed following a battle with police over the closure of a hall of residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The skirmishes flared after police fired tear gas to disperse students who had converged at the campus' Freedom Square to demonstrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cloud of tear gas enveloped the campus as a combined force of some 100 anti-riot and regular police as well as local defence forces stormed the crowd. Dozens of students were injured.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the dismissals and arrests, the University Council ordered the rioting students to report for classes or face expulsion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those not reporting should regard themselves as having dismissed themselves from the university forthwith. Furthermore, any student who attempts to stop others from attending classes shall be dismissed forthwith,&quot; the council said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the students dismissed were the guild president, Remmy Galogitho, and many of the student leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closure of Northcote Hall, at the beginning of the academic year early October, followed failure by the university to identify students who, in May, put pieces of broken glass into food meant for students in the nearby Africa and Livingstone halls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A disciplinary committee chaired by a high court judge was instituted to investigate the matter but it failed to identify the culprits. Then, the university ordered the 720 students of the self-styled &quot;military state&quot; to become non-residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the university has been besieged by the police for a week, a large assembly of students eluded the security detail Wednesday to forcefully open the doors of Northcote Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doors and windows were flung open after students broke into the hall and later lit a bonfire in front of the hall. The university administration had declared the hall off limits to students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a strike by health workers in Uganda which started Tuesday over higher pay is slowly spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wards in Mulago Referral Hospital in Kampala were deserted by Friday except a skeleton staff handling emergencies. Strikers are demanding 900,000 Uganda shillings (900 U.S. dollars) monthly for doctors and 175,000 shillings (175 dollars) for support staff. Doctors currently earn 174,000 shillings (174 dollars) a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second time in two years that health workers have gone on strike over higher pay. In September 1995, the government persuaded the striking workers to resume duty after promising to look into their grievances.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the agreement, signed by Mozambican Transport Minister Paulo Muxanga and the director of the Maputo office of the United States Agency for International Development, George Wachtenheim, complete and quick access to internet will be available in Maputo within six months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system will be available in other major Mozambican cities within a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The installation of internet in Mozambique is part of the 'Leland Initiative', launched by U.S. Vice President Al Gore in 1995.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the agreement, USAID will provide a parabolic antenna and a direct link to the United States at a low cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wacthenheim said that USAID will support all efforts to extend the internet to the largest possible number of users, be they individuals or groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the months to come, we will provide technical assistance to identify and overcome hindrances to the quick expansion of the new technology, and will identify potential applications of the internet in the development of Mozambique,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United Nations, (PANA) - Cameroon is committed to a peaceful settlement of its dispute with Nigeria over the Bakassi Peninsula, President Paul Biya has told the United National General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the beginning, we have given precedence to the approach of dialogue and a peaceful settlement of the dispute by bringing the matter before the OAU, the Security Council and the International Court of Justice at the Hague, &quot; Biya said while addressing the assembly in New York Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Cameroon would accept the decision of the court &quot;as it is appropriate.&quot; Both neighbors have clashed repeatedly over the oil-rich peninsula in the Gulf of Guinea, since 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya, who is also the chairman of the OAU (Organization of African Unity), said the numerous conflicts in Africa -- in Somalia, Sudan, Liberia, Angola and Burundi, among others -- were having devastating consequences for the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facing so many acute problems today, Africa has to see peace as an absolute requirement,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya said although africa was moving along the road to democracy and to the construction of the state of law, poverty was posing the most serious threat to its efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa is indeed the least developed continent,&quot; he told the assembly,&quot; adding: &quot;it is also the most affected by the disastrous effect of economic crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU chairman listed a number of measures which could help to change the fortunes of the continent, including an increase in the flow of private and public resources to the continent, debt reduction and facilitating access for Africa's exports to the world market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He praised Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his &quot;tireless efforts&quot; for the U.N.  and for peace, and re-stated the position of the OAU that he should be re- elected for a second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The heads of state and government of countries that are members of the OAU met last july in Yaounde and reconfirmed their trust in him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We trust that the members of our organization will thus enable Africa to hold two successive terms at the head of the U.N. just as in the past Asia, Europe and Latin America did,&quot; Biya added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - President Chiluba today called for specialisation of museums in the country to attract more tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech read for him by tourism minister, Gabriel Maka at the commissioning of the museum, President Chiluba said it is only when museums start to specialise in the country's many existing cultural and natural heritage that tourists can begin to stay longer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president suggested that the new Lusaka Museum should specialise in technology while another museum of mining and geology should be set up on the Copperbelt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a sure way of keeping tourists longer in the country because of the variety of attractions to show,&quot; the President said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, however, that museums are a relatively new phenomenon in Zambia and perhaps in sub-saharan Africa and as such not many people appreciate the role of museums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Chiluba said many countries in the ancient world including Europe, America, China and India have successfully used museums as major tourists attractions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said by their very nature, museums are a source of income to the nation and as such government will continue to support the sector for it to play a positive role in national development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To under play the role of museums in our national development is tantamount to denying ourselves our cultural identity,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And earlier, director of Lusaka museum Francis Musonda said the museum had taken long to be established due to lack of funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on government to fund the museum adequately for it to perate successfully.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Agricultural Commodity Exchange (ACE) has finally come to the aid of farmers stuck with large quantities of grain in disadvantaged areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACE is launching an exercise that will see the purchase of maize in these areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peasant and Small scale Farmers Association chairman, Charles Zandala, in an interview yesterday, disclosed that the ACE had asked farmers to gather their grain in strategic points so as to ease the purchase exercise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During my tour of the Kalomo and Mapanza areas, I was impressed to see that unlike the Food Reserve Agency delays to service the disadvantaged areas, ACE has come to the aid of farmers,&quot; Zandala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zandala explained that ACE has advised farmers to gather their grain stocks jointly to enable them to sale attractive quantities of maize at fair prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the maize is grouped together, it will be easier for buyers to target these areas as they will be assured of sourcing large quantities of grain,&quot; Zandala explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the peasant farmers association, farmers in Mapanza area, where the exercise is set to kick off tomorrow, have already gathered 10, 000 bags of grain which will be purchased by ACE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zandala complained that the farmers in disadvantaged areas were being &quot; ripped off &quot; by unscrupulous grain traders who had been buying their grain at a meagre K5,000 or by other commodities such as second hand clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ACE is offering K13,500 per 90 kilogramme bag of maize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cavemont Merchant Bank has also followed suit and has set its offer at K14, 500 in all disadvantaged areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government recently allocated K10 billion to the Food Reserve Agency to facilitate the purchase of grain from the remote areas usually shunned by grain traders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move was aimed at saving grain from going to waste as most of the farmers do not have proper storage facilities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The branch, which began operating some two months ago, is being managed by Zambia's theatre-cum-music export to South Africa, Kingsley &quot;Kalicheli&quot; Sinkala.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have signed on eleven South African artistes so far,&quot; claimed Sinkala in an interview at the branch located on Market Street near the Carlton Centre. &quot;Our aim is to fuse South African music with Zambian contemporary sound and come up with something unique.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sinkala's debut album, Katinanga , which is expected to be released sometime next year will be the first LP to be released on the label.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recorded at the Sound of Soweto studios, the album contains some moving tracks,among them Off To The City, Nka Fwila Mu Chila and the title track, which should appeal to many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DNI, which is run by Chartered Accountant, Rodger Sombe, has extensive music interests in Zambian show business and has signed on nearly 70 per cent of Zambian artistes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the African scene the bank, in the Best Foreign Bank category, outclassed other domestic banks, which the magazine could not mention.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank is however growing and last year boasted of a total capital of US$27.7 billion. A further stock buy back programme estimated in excess of US$4.7 billion was announced.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the exhibition taking place at a residential area, that was another part that added a whole different feel to the exhibition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black Star Liner owner Enock Banda who promoted the function said the venue was a deliberate choice which he knew would add colour to the whole exhibition that ran up to Sunday: &quot;This exhibition was also organised by artists: Anne Legall and Zenab Abad,&quot; said Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition had five big artists: Dominic Yombwe who has exhibited in many group exhibitions since 1991, Godfrey Yombwe who has organised joint exhibition with another reknowned artist Poto Kabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Bay, Mauritius - Amnesty International (AI) has accused the Zambian government of manipulating the electoral process and denying popular participation so that it could remain in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge was made by AI legal adviser for Africa, Ahmed Motala, on Wednesday at the 20th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human rights and People's rights (ACHPR) in the Mauritian northern pleasure resort town of Grand Bay.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motala's charges on the MMD government were made in the presence of AFRONET president and Zambia's Committee for a Clean Campaign (CCC) chairman, Ngande Mwanajiti and NGO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-ordinating Committee board member Phosile Tracy Sichinga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And AI cited Zambia as one of the three African countries that violates human rights and restricts free political activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motala said despite the existence of multipartyism in Zambia, Kenya and Zimbabwe these countries had closed avenues for peaceful expression of political opposition to their governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are many African countries where the democratic process is in transition but most of these governments are not committed to respect human rights,&quot; Motala told the 20th Ordinary Session ACHPR which is also commemorating the 10th Anniversary of the African Charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the officials from the ACHPR said that while several governments had been represented, Zambia had not sent any official to the two-week meeting which ends on October 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AI also criticised the serious attacks of the judiciary in Zambia and other countries by the executive, fearing that the criticism could lead to the judiciary being compromised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission was urged to advise erring countries to stick to last session's resolutions if the independence of the judiciary is to be achieved in African countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - What's the political or moral justification for supporting fraudulent elections?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is surprising that people who all along had been complaining that the political play field is not level and any elections held under these conditions will not be free and fair are today urging UNIP not to boycott clearly fraudulent polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have carried many stories in which ZDC leaders were exposing serious flaws in the registration of voters and extensive irregularities in the voters' roll. Even this Wednesday voters' register irregularities were still surfacing. More than 4,000 people who had registered as voters in Livingstone, including High Court judge Christopher Mushabati, were omitted from the roll.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The electoral arrangements which ZDC, other political parties and civic organisations had great concerns about have not been addressed by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is what is the political or moral justification for participating in fraudulent elections?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the decision by ZDC and others not to boycott the polls a matter of principle or just expedience in the quest for political power ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the now over quoted comparison with what happened in Zimbabwe, Ghana or Cameroon when the opposition boycotted elections has been over generalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are fundamental differences which have been over looked in these comparisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who boycotted in Zimbabwe, Ghana or Cameroon did not command substantial support as UNIP does. There is a big difference between ZANU- DONGA's size and quality of support and that of UNIP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And can one imagine what would have happened if the threats which were made by the MMD in 1991 that if their demands for this or that were not met they would boycott elections was actually effected! We were lucky UNIP met all their demands and spared the nation veritable chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the consensus, which has existed for almost over a year, among opposition parties, NGOs , churches, donors, students and other stakeholders, over the unacceptable electoral arrangements put in place by the MMD government cannot be found in these countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where is the assurance now coming from that these the same electoral arrangements, which have been condemned by the great majority of Zambians, including ZDC, can enable UNIP and other opposition parliamentary candidates to get to the National Assembly?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact the withdrawal of UNIP may compel the MMD to rig a few seats for opportunistic parties, like ZDC, which have helped through their participation to render some legitimacy to their fraud, as a reward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the fraudulent set up affects presidential and parliamentary candidates in the same way - after all there is only one voters' roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, we believe UNIP's boycott was timely and correct.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Seven other opposition parties under the opposition alliance have joined the boycott of next month's presidential and general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zambia Civic Education Association (ZCEA) chairperson Lucy Sichone said the opposition parties should go further and disrupt this year's elections because they were fraudulent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven alliance members made the decision on the boycott after a four hour meeting held in Lusaka yesterday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They included National Party (NP) Liberal Progressive Front, (LPF) National Democratic Party (NDP), National Salvation Party, Grass Root People's Party, Independent Democratic Front and Labour Party,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda's press aide Muhabi Lungu said after the meeting that the alliance has unanimously agreed not to be part of the &quot; confused electoral process&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seven presidents who were present at the meeting have all agreed not to take part in the forthcoming elections,&quot; Lungu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This brings to eight the number of political parties boycotting the elections after UNIP's pull out on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sichone said the opposition should not only boycott elections but should also ensure that they are disrupted. She said the Chief Justice should soon take up the governance of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I personally will campaign strongly to ensure that elections do not take place,&quot; Sichone said in an interview. &quot;The Chief Justice is a capable man and he will take over the governance while the issues are being resolved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said people of Zambia will not sacrifice their &quot;peace and patience for Chiluba to continue in power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said it was good that ZDC would field candidates against MMD so that Chiluba is not declared president unopposed after nominations today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that they field candidates does not mean they are participating in an election. But a boycott on its own can not achieve anything, something more must be done,&quot; Sichone said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NP, which was represented at the meeting by its president Humphrey Mulemba however gave conflicting statements about its stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the morning its spokesman Sam Chipungu told The Post his party would take part in the elections in accordance with the demands of its members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;National Party respects the decision of UNIP. It is an internal matter of the party. We feel National Party should help Zambians make a decision. If the people vote for the same party, then it will be them to blame and nobody else,&quot; Chipungu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NP vice-president and Lawyer Daniel Lisulo could also not help clarify the position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The best man to do that is the president himself who represented the party at the alliance talks this afternoon Lisulo said,&quot; adding he was himself ignorant of the party's position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But NP president, Humphrey Mulemba, speaking in an interview at his Roma residence last night insisted that his party would only participate in the polls if all electoral flaws are addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a party, we feel the best way forward is to take part in the elections but if nothing is done on the flaws in the electoral process, we will have no option but to pull out. We are only waiting to meet the Electoral Commission,&quot; said Mulemba</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC), the National Lima Party and the National Democratic Alliance say they would participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Lima Party co-chairman, Ben Kapita, said his party would participate in the elections because they did not want to make President Chiluba and Kaunda indispensable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his party once in Parliament will advocate for the change of unpopular laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LPF acting national secretary, Jennifer Phiri, however said her party would not participate because nothing has been done about the Constitution, Nikuv register, Public Order Act and the unfair coverage by the public media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said they would continue fighting for the changing of the Constitution before and after the elections. And she assured her party believes in peace and would not use violent means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NADA president, Yona Phiri, who was the only opposition leader at the State House's 32nd independence anniversary celebrations, said in an interview yesterday that despite being a member of the inter-party alliance his party would participate in the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The inter-party alliance is there to reconcile the nation. Each party has its own identity and so NADA will participate in the elections if we have the necessary logistical capacity,&quot; Phiri said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP last Wednesday announced that it would boycott the 'sham' elections and mount a massive campaign to urge Zambians not to cast their votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) yesterday made a passionate appeal to UNIP to rescind its decision not to take part in the forth coming presidential and general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZCTU secretary general, Alec Chirwa, said in a statement that the absence of UNIP in the elections was a disturbing issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victory Ministeries Pastor Nevers Mumba said he was worried with the turn of events after UNIP announced that it was going to boycott the elections and called on the government to have dialogue with all the stake holders to avert possible violence in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In diplomatic circles, Germany and French ambassadors to Zambia yesterday described as unfortunate the decision by the country's leading opposition, UNIP, to boycott the November 18 presidential and general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany ambassador to Zambia Peter Schmidt, in an interview during celebrations to mark the 32nd anniversary of Zambia's independence at State House yesterday, said &quot;UNIP's decision was a big blow to democracy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We respect the feelings of president Kaunda and his friends but they have not done a good thing for democracy in Zambia,&quot; Ambassador Schmidt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He advised that UNIP should have only boycotted the presidential race while fielding candidates in the parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The opposition could have made an impact in parliament which could have greatly contributed in the strengthening of the decision making process in the house,&quot; Ambassador Schmidt said. &quot; I wish he could reverse his decision but we respect it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French ambassador to Zambia Phillipe De La Bathie also said it was sad to note that &quot;other people were boycotting elections&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The decision by UNIP is an internal matter but it is always difficult to see some parts of the country boycotting elections,&quot; he said but refused to be drawn into further discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier President Frederick Chiluba, in his speech, accused Kaunda who he said had not even registered as a voter of inciting people not to vote for selfish interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is hypocritical and totally immoral for an individual who has not registered as a voter to contrive to deny registered voters their right to vote by invoking individual grievances,&quot; President Chiluba charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But president Kaunda during a press conference and national wide television broadcast on Wednesday, charged that the government of President Chiluba &quot;had seemingly complicated, misrepresented and twisted through a web of deceit issues that were straight forward&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bottom line is that the doings of MMD over the Constitution and the elections are all aimed at perpetuating self interests,&quot; Kaunda charged on Wednesday. &quot;It relates to the plunder and misappropriation of the country's wealth by a few, self interest as it relates to a few individuals who have so much enjoyed the trapping of political power and will hold on at all costs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement by Dr Wendy Orr from the Truth And Reconciliation Commission on October 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement by Dr Bernard Mandell, newly appointed President of the World Medical Association (WMA), that consensus had developed around the issue (of a separate truth commission for doctors) is premature in that it pre-empts the proceedings of a national consultative workshop on November 23 this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was quoted as saying that there is &quot;consensus among his peers that it would therefore be unnecessary to have a separate truth commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because there is still considerable debate and disagreement within the profession as to how best the past can be examined and a future human rights culture ensured within the profession, the TRC will be facilitating this workshop which aims to bring about a consensus amongst the various groupings as to what process should be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcome of this workshop is by no means a foregone conclusion, as Dr Mandell seems to imply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Orr, who is the deputy chairperson of the TRC's Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee, leaves this week for London where she was invited by the British Medical Association (BMA) to act as consultant on issues relating to the medical profession and human rights. She is also a member of the Medical Association of South Africa's ethics committee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees today urged Rwandan refugees caught in fighting in eastern Zaire to consider returning to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High Commissioner Sadako Ogata, in a statement broadcast by local radio stations in the region, said she was &quot;deeply saddened&quot; that Burundi and Rwandan refugees are again fleeing for their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am afraid this terrible situation may not stop immediately, and I would like you to know that we will do everything possible, in cooperation with the authorities, to help you where we can,&quot; Ogata said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of your current ordeal, I am sure you will consider where you will be safer -- in Zaire or in Rwanda. That is a decision for you to make.  However, I am sincerely asking you to remember that 80,000 refugees have recently returned home to Rwanda from Burundi, and UNHCR and UN human rights observers report that they are now busy resuming normal lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting the Rwandan government has renewed its offer to receive refugees in peace, Ogata said the international community is present in Rwanda to support repeated government assurances that refugees can return safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR Special Envoy Dessalegn Chefeke and Rwandan government representatives on Friday visited the Rwandan border town of Cyangugu in the southwest to look into facilities to receive potential returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are three reception centers in Cyangugu with a total capacity of 15, 000 per day. UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration have 120 trucks and buses available to transport returnees to their home communes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR has stockpiled 50,000 blankets, 25,000 plastic sheets, 60,000 jerrycans, and 34,000 agricultural tools in southwestern Rwanda. It has stocks of non-food items for 300,000 people in Kampala, Uganda, and in Ngara, Tanzania, that can easily be moved overland to Rwanda to meet the needs of returnees. Two emergency teams, each composed of three persons, are prepared to fly to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Food Program is providing a two-month food package to the returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 300,000 Burundi and Rwandan refugees and displaced Zairians are on the move in the Uvira and Bukavu regions in eastern Zaire. They include the Burundi and Rwandan refugees who left the camps in Uvira and Rwandan refugees in Bukavu who have fled camps in the east to go to the western part of the region, fearing a Banyamulenge attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR has supplies in Bukavu for an estimated 80,000 refugees and displaced Zairians arriving in the area from Uvira, scene of heavy fighting between Zairian troops and the Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire hosts 1 million of the 1.7 million Rwandan refugees in the Great Lakes region. There also are 143,000 Burundi refugees in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR has been having funding difficulties in its operations in the Great Lakes, which have forced the revision of its 1996 budget from $288 million to $253 million. So far, funds available total $201 million, of which $195 million has been committed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Zaire has received no testimony or other information indicating that there has been any improvement in the human rights situation in there, according to the preliminary observations issued by Special Rapporteur Roberto Garretsn last Saturday upon returning from his latest mission to Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 13 to 25 October mission, which took him to Kinshasa, the north Kivu city of Goma, and the south Kivu city of Bukavu, the Special Rapporteur met with representatives of the Zairian Government and with local authorities.  In the three cities, he also heard from several non-governmental organizations and institutions representing civil society and from persons who had requested to meet with him. He was unable to go to Uvira due to the conflict raging there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information Mr. Garretsn gathered told of extrajudicial, arbitrary or summary executions; arbitrary arrests and detention; and torture and ill- treatment of prisoners, all practices facilitated by the persistence of impunity. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur received no response concerning the dozens of cases of human rights violations brought to his knowledge by Zairian citizens and made known to the authorities beforehand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to the democratization process, the Special Rapporteur observed some progress, as reflected in, among other things, the establishment of a National Electoral Commission, the adoption of a text of a Constitution to be submitted to a referendum, and the adoption and promulgation of a law on referendums. But progress in that field has been accomplished slowly, while the time limits set for the institutions of the Third Republic to begin functioning are repeatedly pushed back; the Special Rapporteur fears another postponement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garretsn does not share the view of the authorities that pursuing the electoral process and the establishment of democratic institutions depended now on support from the international community. In effect, he observes, the establishment of the rule of law in a democratic State respectful of human rights and fundamental freedoms was an obligation, not a duty before presumed foreign pressure. International cooperation is certainly important for the realization of such a process, but the lack of it could not justify keeping in place an authoritarian regime. In addition, there are indispensable conditions for a transparent democratic process which did not depend on international cooperation, but which were not being fulfilled because of a lack of political will. Such is the case particularly in the failure to give effect to a real pluralism in the public media, as well as in the lack of effective guarantees for the exercise of the freedoms of expression, demonstration and assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visit of the Special Rapporteur took place as the armed conflict raged in Uvira, in the east of the country. A number of elements have contributed to the aggravation of tension and to the so-called &quot;conflict of the Banyamulenge&quot;, a Tutsi community living in the high plateaus of the south Kivu region, writes the Special Rapporteur. He mentions in that regard the contribution, in the form of men and financial resources, of the Tutsis settled in Zaire to the war effort of the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While expressing concern over the question of the nationality of the Banyamulenge -- which he hopes the Zairian authorities would settle with equity and humanity -- the Special Rapporteur regrets that the Banyamulenge have chosen violence to claim their rights. That violence has already claimed a number of victims. The Special Rapporteur also condemns the recourse to foreign support. In that respect, the Zairian authorities have informed him of material evidence of the participation of armed Rwandan and Burundian citizens, with the consent of their respective Governments, in the violent actions and attacks perpetrated in Zairian territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Special Rapporteur says he is also extremely concerned by incitations to hate and war on the part of the highest Rwandan authorities, as well as by the response of Zairian military and civilian authorities, whether at the national or regional level. Mr. Garretsn encourages the responsible and moderate attitude of the Prime Minister of Zaire, who has abstained until now from making inflammatory statements. He calls on the Rwandan, Burundian and Zairian authorities to refrain from any act or statement that could lead to an escalation in the murderous violence and confrontation that has already caused dozens of dead and wounded and led to the flight and dispersion of Rwandans, Burundians and local populations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - (Note: The UN DHA Integrated Regional Information Network (IRIN) does not usually distribute political statements, but given the current crisis, we feel it is useful for the humanitarian community to be aware of the widest range of information possible. IRIN's distribution of the item of course does imply endorsement in any way.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Press Release from the RALLY FOR THE RETURN OF REFUGEES AND DEMOCRACY IN RWANDA October 25. Bruxelles Tel: 32-2-5348035 Fax: 32-2-5348053. Paris Tel/Fax: 33-41489987.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reliable reports reaching us from South KIVU indicate that thousands of Hutu refugees, particular the most vulnerable groups who include, women, the elderly, children pregnant women have died and are walking copses due to lack of water, food shelter, and medicine. Contrary to widely publicised reports, these refugees are not fleeing the fighting between Zairean troops and the Tutsi rebels(Banyamurenge), but because they have been direct targets of Banyamurenge militia and the RPF and Burundian troops, who are coordinating their action to drive Hutu refugees, like cattle, into Rwanda and Burundi.  However instead of accepting to be forced into the hands of their attackers in Rwanda and Burundi, refugees have so far dodged the trap and are braving the hostile environment in the hills and forests of South Kivu, where they are likely to die a slow but sure death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One should recall that this is a heavy rainy season and the area is not accessible to humanitarian assistance. In order to starve to death these refugees, the combined forces composed of Banyamurenge militia, RPF and Burundian troops have made sure to cut all the supply routes to refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In North KIVU, a similar operation is taking place. The supply routes from Uganda were cut between BUNAGANA and GOMA and between KIBUMBA and Goma, and BUNIA and GOMA with the help of some elements from UGANDA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the RPF troops are poised to attack the refugee camps of KIBUMBA, MUGUNGA, KATALE and KAHINDO, in order to escort at gun point the refugees back to Rwanda. The troops supposed to carry out the operation are from a well known position of the RPA army in MUTURA area, GISENYI prefecture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid all these military raids by none other than RPF on rwandese refugee camps, the UNHCR is calling upon refugees to return home and has even embarked on a program of extending reception centres inside Rwanda. At the same time, in which looks like a coordinated strategy against Rwandese refugees, we are reliably informed that the Tanzanian minister of defense declared in a press conference on Wednesday October 16,1996, that his country was going very soon to forcefully send Rwandese refugees back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much as refugees and understand the problems faced with the UNHCR in taking care of them under the present circumstances, refugees are nevertheless at loss to understand the rationale behind sending refugees to Rwanda whose regime is raiding their camps in neighbouring countries. This amounts to nothing but jumping from frying pan to fire. Moreover, the present chaos in Eastern Zaire, having been masterminded by the RPF and its brain child the BANYAMURENGE rebellion, purposely to corner and drive the refugees out by force of arms, coercing refugees to go home under any umbrella is giving in to RPF policy of annihilating refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees in these camps have gone without food, water and medicine for days and some have already died out of lack of care, a reminiscence of the cholera epidemic of July 94 which claimed tens of thousands of lives in Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is very sad that a human disaster of such magnitude leaves the international community, particular some human rights organisations and humanitarian agencies unmoved. It is inconceivable that some governments of civilised nations sacrifice millions of human beings allegedly to save 1 million dollar that is spent a day to feed refugees or, to impose on them regimes which they legitimately do not trust or to serve some hidden geopolitical interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RDR calls upon all civilised and peace loving people to get out of their indifference and come to the rescue of thousands of dying refugees particularly children, women and the elderly. Human rights organisations and humanitarian agencies should exert pressure on governments and relevant UN agencies so to bring Rwandan and Burundian governments to immediately open route supplies to refugee camps.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome - The World Food Programme has begun prepositioning food supplies inside Rwanda along the border with Zaire amid reports that over 4,500 people fleeing armed clashes have crossed into the country. Thousands more are said to be massing at the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP staff report that on Sunday in the town of Gisenyi, about 4,500 people crossed over from Goma, Zaire. It's estimated that 3,000 of these are Zairians and the rest are Rwandan refugees who fled to Zaire in 1994. Nine of the Zairian refugees were wounded, five seriously.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 10,000 people are estimated to have massed on the Goma side of the border where fighting continues north of the town. In Cyangugu, across the river from the Zairian town of Bukavu, an estimated 250 to 500 people have crossed into Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP has already prepositioned 7,000 two-month rations in Gisenyi as well as 10,000 rations in Cyangugu. WFP plans to immediately preposition an additional 63,000 rations in the Rwandan capital Kigali. The agency is also readying 300,000 additional rations which can be in Rwanda within a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know if this sudden spurt of returnees will turn into a growing trend,&quot; said WFP spokesman Trevor Rowe. &quot;But we don't want to be caught napping if it turns into a flood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, WFP has decided to divert about 85 trucks bearing a cargo of food from the Uganda-Zaire border where they had been blocked for several days. The vehicles had initially been destined for Goma but could not cross the border because of worsened security conditions. The trucks, bearing a cargo of maize and split peas, have been redirected to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA, United States (PANA) - UNESCO Director-General, Federico Mayor, and the Rev. Leon Sullivan have signed a cooperation agreement calling for their organizations to work together in Africa and the United States in building a culture of peace through education, science, culture and communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The formal agreement between UNESCO and three organizations founded by Sullivan -- the International Foundation for Education and Self Help (IFESH), the African-African American summit and the Opportunities Industrialization Centers International (OICI) -- was signed Saturday at a ceremony attended by political, business and civic leaders, members of the clergy, and representatives of the African diplomatic community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reiterating that &quot;education is the basis of freedom,&quot; Mayor said the agreement will &quot;give a new message of hope to the children of the nations of Africa.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan predicted his new &quot;partnership with UNESCO will create a revolution in education and skills training for Sub-Saharan Africa. Education is essential for progress. If you can't read, you can't lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stating that he will promote the UNESCO agreement at the fourth African- African American summit in Harare in July, 1997, he said he plans to launch a 'Help Africa Campaign' involving governments, civic organizations and the private sector. UNESCO will assist with the organization of the next summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement calls for UNESCO and the three organizations to cooperate in the areas of basic education and literacy, including teacher training and curriculum development, higher education; promoting human rights and tolerance. Others are improving the status of women, science and technology development; and building communication capacities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of its main goals is to foster closer links between Africa and African Americans through educational and cultural exchanges, such as the establishment of UNESCO chairs at universities in Africa and in the United States, particularly at universities serving the African American community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizations will participate in UNESCO's Culture of Peace Programme in Africa by helping to provide education and training to demobilized soldiers and training local non-government organizations in the management of development and self-help programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan, long a key figure in the U.S. civil rights movement, was a leader in the battle against apartheid in South Africa. He is the author of the Sullivan Principles, a code of conduct for companies operating in South Africa during apartheid which advocated equal opportunity and an end to discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He founded OICI of America in 1964 to provide job and business training and five years later expanded the programme to Africa. IFESH was founded in the 1980s to involve American companies, institutions and individuals in education, health and economic development programs in Africa and now has numerous projects in over 30 countries in the continent and in Peru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1991, Sullivan has been organizing the African-African American summits to assist in development and influence policy decisions in economic and social development, democracy and peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - A renowned Nigerian author has revived the controversial debate on the origins of AIDS and accused United States scientists of inventing the incurable disease to reduce the Black population globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known simply as Chinweizu, the author, who is a newspaper columnist famous for his fierce social commentary, said in a lecture Friday that the American scientists now link AIDS with the African green monkey as part of the conspiracy to discredit the Black race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In order to disguise its origin some people started the disinformation that it (AIDS) infected humanity through green monkeys in central Africa,&quot; he said in Lagos while delivering a lecture on &quot;Black world collective security: Black redemption doctrines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinweizu said the grand conspiracy by developed countries against Africa was &quot;based on the model of too many men in a sinking the boat.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To save the rest, &quot; he said, &quot;you cast one third overboard to the circling sharks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the boat continues to sink,&quot; Chinweizu added, &quot;you select another one- third of those in it, and cast them overboard too. And you repeat the process until you get rid of enough to keep the boat afloat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social critic said Americans and Europeans chose &quot;Blacks as those to throw first to the sharks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Black Africa is a prime target for their population control squad despite its comparatively very low population density.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy on the origin of AIDS first raged in the 1980s, with Western scientists arguing that AIDS originated in Africa. Other scientists argued that it originated in the experimental laboratories of Western scientists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Nigerian author argued that in inventing the virus, the American scientists planned a systematic elimination of the &quot;inhabitants of an allegedly overcrowded spaceship earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the plan was &quot;to fashion a world in which a small minority can squander the earth's entire resources on themselves, and other minority are enslaved to serve them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Chinweizu, the conspirators &quot;intend for the Blacks exactly what the Nazis attempted on the Jews in Europe and what the Yankees inflicted on the native Americans and what Australians accomplished on the aboriginal Tasmanians, namely extermination and drastic depopulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For rather than use the nuclear bomb for the planned extermination, they have started with the AIDS bomb,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian author also accused the United Nations of being privy to the recolonization of Africa, perpetrated through agencies such the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the UN's job to keep the Black countries maldeveloped, unindustrialized and economically strangulated, to erode their sovereignty and turn them into de facto trust territories as a prelude to their being openly recolonized,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To stem the neocolonialism, Chinweizu said Black nations should &quot;reappraise our geographical situation, and thereby clear our minds of all manner of obfuscation, delusion and diversions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Black world should see the &quot;Eurocentric global order&quot; as a source of &quot;our strategic insecurity,&quot; hence the need for a &quot;a collective security alliance for the Black world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this end, the author said Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, should host in 1997 a &quot;Black redemption congress, to mobilize for the battle against recolonization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He volunteered to convene the congress under the auspices of the &quot;Black heritage and policy journal of the Black world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individuals, private organizations and governments of Black world are expected to attend the proposed meeting in Abuja, the Nigerian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinweizu also suggested that Nigeria organize a &quot;Black World League of Nations&quot; conference in 1999, after an expert meeting to clarify the principles, goals and organizational form of the league.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi (PANA) - The International Committee of the Red Cross says it will not return to Burundi until the killing of three of its personnel has been fully investigated, an official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We asked for a thorough investigation immediately after the attack,&quot; Patrick Berner, the agency's representative in Bujumbura, said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have returned to Burundi precisely in order to relaunch the investigations prior to the resumption of our activities in the country,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berner, who arrived in the Burundian capital on Saturday, said the killings of its officials June 6 were the first in the agency's history. The officials were killed in Cibitoke province, in northwest Burundi, where they had gone to supply drinking water to locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Red Cross was &quot;extremely worried by the events&quot; in eastern Zaire, where fighting between ethnic Tutsi rebels, known as the Banyamurenge, and the Zairian army has caused an exodus of hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees from 12 camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing reprisals from genocide against the Tutsi, these refugees fled Rwanda in 1994, following the victory of a largely Tutsi guerrilla force over a Hutu dominated government army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least one million people were killed and about two million others fled into exile, mostly to eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's troubled international soccer star, Nwankwo Kanu, alleged by Italian cardiologist to have a heart problem, can sue the doctors for breach of confidence, a leading Nigerian constitutional lawyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Ozekhome, also a human rights activist, told PANA in Lagos that &quot;the manner of disclosure&quot; of the star's alleged ailment was in breach of the patient/doctor relationship and smacked of a grand conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In legal parlance, the offense is known as &quot;Uberima Fidei&quot; or breach of fiduciary relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ozekhome said medical doctors are ethically prohibited by the Hippocratic oath to keep personal issues concerning their client's health strictly confidential unless they had the full consent of the patient.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kanu can sue them and his new club Inter Milan,&quot; Ozekhome said. There could, he added, even be greater grounds for damages if an independent examination reveals that Kanu is healthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, Western media reported on to the allegations of Kanu's ill- health based on the Italian doctors' diagnosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctors ruled Kanu unfit for future professional soccer, thereby provoking a huge controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a brilliant stint with European champions Ajax of Amsterdam, Kanu, 20, began moves to switch clubs just before the centennial Olympic in Atlanta '96, where he led Nigeria's under-23 team to win the soccer gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was obliged to take Ajax to court to obtain his release to the Italian club, Inter Milan, on slightly over a two-million-U.S.-dollar contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the fitness test by the doctors for Inter Milan that triggered the controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ezekhome said that even if Kanu was finally confirmed to have a weak aorta valve, he could still sue Ajax for negligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ezekhome said that the disclosures by the doctors for Inter Milan were the most damaging on Kanu. Ezekhome said that an independent assessment should have been conducted before the announcement was made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Premature disclosure, he said, amounted &quot;to killing Kanu's entire football career, thereby rendering him unmarketable and useless, and even denting his family's image, since heart ailment can be hereditary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ezekhome said, &quot;it could make any reasonable club shun him and his marketability will plummet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent medical opinion has also faulted the claims by the doctors for Inter Milan, saying that a surgery could rectify such an ailment, assuming Kanu has one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a pretty standard operation,&quot; said Dr. Michael Debakey, of the Baylor Medical Center in Houston, Texas, the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in an interview, Debakey said: &quot;Kanu should have a good result (after the operation), depending on his overall physical condition and his age.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debakey, a renowned cardiologist, said Kanu &quot;should be able to resume normal activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another American heart specialist, Dr. Adolph Hutter, said it was important to take a look at the player to evaluate the problem, adding &quot;the question is how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctors are agreed that an independent opinion from that of the Italian doctors was needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nigeria, the government has pledged to underwrite Kanu's medical expenses to ascertain his true state of health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Youth and Sports Minister Jim Nwobodo, who lambasted the local press for &quot; exaggerating the player's predicament,&quot; supports an independent examination, preferably in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Nigerian Football Association has detailed a member of its medical team, Dr. Mohammed Muazu, to liaise with Inter Milan for a comprehensive report on the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment Kanu is saying very little. In his first press interview granted to a privately owned Nigerian radio he said &quot;there is nothing spectacular about my health.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accusing the media of blowing the issue out of proportion, Kanu said &quot;the stories written about my heart problem have been over blown. They (media) kept on writing about me as if there was no other thing to write.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am alright. There is no problem with me. Inter Milan has not dropped me,&quot; Kanu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His parents have also expressed concern, dismissing the alleged health problem as an orchestrated campaign by those who do not wish Nigeria and their son well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The situation in the Kivu province of Zaire has deteriorated even further. Apart from the actual fighting, excesses resulting from undisciplined behaviour on the part of those bearing weapons, intolerance and terror are giving rise to the worst fears for the Zairian civilian population and the hundreds of thousands of refugees in the area.

Security conditions in the town have degenerated to the point where any movement is extremely dangerous. In the last few days several hospitals have been attacked and looted, Red Cross vehicles have been stolen and humanitarian workers harassed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Near Goma (North Kivu), where seven delegates are still working, the ICRC has managed to distribute emergency aid to some 12,000 Zairians who fled their villages to escape the recent days' fighting. Hospitals in Goma which are treating casualties received medicines and other medical supplies on 27 October. The ICRC also delivered assistance to the dispensary in Mugunga, where more than 150,000 refugees from the Kibumba camp have now arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC calls once again on all political and military leaders to respect and ensure respect for the basic and universally recognized rules which protect civilians, the wounded and captured combatants, as well as the staff of humanitarian organizations, the ICRC in particular.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - The General Assembly would encourage the resumption of direct talks between Morocco and the Frente Popular para la Liberacion de Saguia el-Hamra y de Rio de Oro (POLISARIO) to relaunch the peace process in Western Sahara, by the terms of an orally-revised draft resolution approved without a vote by the Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization) this afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assembly would also express serious concern about obstacles to the settlement plan, and reaffirm the Organization's responsibility to the people of Western Sahara, as well as its commitment to a free, fair and impartial referendum for self-determination.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The text stresses the importance of the cease-fire as an integral part of the settlement plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In introducing the draft and oral amendments, the representative of the United Republic of Tanzania said the international community should persist in the decolonization of Western Sahara and make it possible for the Saharawi people to exercise their right to self-determination. The representative of Morocco said the question of Sahara could be dealt with only in the context of his country's territory. It was not a matter of decolonization. The representatives of Angola and Ireland (on behalf of other countries) also made statements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - A Government delegation presented the Human Rights Committee this morning with Gabon's first report on implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, stating that such rights were receiving greater emphasis as the country moved from single-party rule to multi-party democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Committee members, noting that the report arrived 13 years after Gabon's ratification of the Covenant and seemed thin on detail, asked numerous questions about legal protections for citizens, the actual state of women's rights, the independence of the judiciary, and limits on pre-trial detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sebastien Mamboundou Mouyama, Minister of State for Communication, Culture, Arts, Education, and Human Rights, and head of the seven-member delegation, introduced the report by saying that despite the problems experienced by a developing country, the Government in its new multi-party form was basing its activities on respect for human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabon is one of 134 States parties to the Covenant, and under the terms of the treaty is obligated to present periodic reports to the Committee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee will reconvene at 3 p.m. to continue its discussion with the Gabonese delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Report of Gabon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial report of Gabon on efforts to implement the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (document CCPR/C/31/Add.4) reviews the status of the treaty in the country on an article-by-article basis. An introduction places the human-rights situation in historical context, tracing the process under which the nation achieved independence in 1960, struggled under a military coup and one-party rule, and then, in 1990, during a national conference, adopted a programme of transition to multi-party democracy. The conclusion of the report remarks that while the country has strived to respect international human-rights agreements, it has had to cope with internal economic and political difficulties, and with the overall problems of a developing country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Introduction of Report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEBASTIEN MAMBOUNDOU MOUYAMA, Minister of State for Communication, Culture, Arts, Education, and Human Rights, said that major changes were under way in the country aimed at establishing multi-party democracy, restoring public order, and fostering human rights. A new Constitution dedicated to political pluralism would be adopted; free legislative elections would be organized and a national assembly with representatives of opposition parties would be formed. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had recently visited Gabon, and a mission of the Centre for Human Rights would soon arrive in Libreville to evaluate the needs of Gabon so that a technical-assistance programme could be established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consideration of Report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation of Gabon began by providing answers to a list of questions prepared in advance by the Committee. These dealt with such topics as the status of the Covenant in the country; the drafting of a new Constitution; the duties of national human-rights bodies; equality of the sexes; and police procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A human-rights commission that was entirely autonomous -- outside the Government -- was envisaged soon, Mr. MAMBOUNDOU MOUYAMA said. That would be accomplished following a visit from the Centre for Human Rights; advice was needed on how to do this, and it also was necessary to have the new democratic Government in place and the legislature seated to analyze and approved the arrangement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discrimination against women was not a serious problem in Gabon, Mr.  MAMBOUNDOU MOUYAMA said; women had equal rights to education and functioned in general as equal member of society; although currently they were underrepresented in Government and elected positions, that should change rapidly as the new democratic system took hold. The country's Constitutional Court was headed by a woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extra-judicial executions and involuntary disappearances had not been a problem in the country, the Minister said. Under the previous regime there occasionally had been acts not in line with human-rights standards, said Lieutenant-Colonel Major HILAIRE NDJOYE, of the Ministry of National Defense, in response to a question about torture; the new Government was changing perceptions among police and security personnel. Confessions that were obtained through torture were not accepted in court. Training of police was in the process of being improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Length of pre-trial detention and detention conditions were governed by law, said JEAN BAPTISTE RAZINGUE, Counsellor to the Minister of Justice. The length of pre-trial detention for criminal charges was a maximum of 12 months, which could be extended to a maximum of another 12 months. Detainees had to be released if not brought to trial within those time limits. In criminal cases, police custody could be extended to a maximum of eight days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In comments from the floor, Committee members said the report lacked detail; they sought further information on a state of emergency in the early 1990s, which under the Covenant should have been reported to the UN Secretary- General, along with a summary of the rights affected by the procedure; they asked, among other things, what specific laws prohibited discrimination and what recourses were provided for those discriminated against; if old discriminatory laws against women had been eliminated, including prohibitions against contraception; what the mortality rates were for men and women; if traditions and customs in Gabonese society sometimes hindered equality between the sexes; if the judiciary was sufficiently independent of the national administration; if the military was responsible for the tasks of the police, or if a civil police force existed; how many death sentences had been pronounced, and for what offenses; what were considered proper grounds for arrest and detention; what were the rates of school attendance; and if there were problems with bonded labour and child labour in Gabon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA, United States (PANA) - UNESCO Director-General, Federico Mayor, and the Rev. Leon Sullivan have signed a cooperation agreement calling for their organizations to work together in Africa and the United States in building a culture of peace through education, science, culture and communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The formal agreement between UNESCO and three organizations founded by Sullivan -- the International Foundation for Education and Self Help (IFESH), the African-African American summit and the Opportunities Industrialization Centers International (OICI) -- was signed Saturday at a ceremony attended by political, business and civic leaders, members of the clergy, and representatives of the African diplomatic community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reiterating that &quot;education is the basis of freedom,&quot; Mayor said the agreement will &quot;give a new message of hope to the children of the nations of Africa.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan predicted his new &quot;partnership with UNESCO will create a revolution in education and skills training for Sub-Saharan Africa. Education is essential for progress. If you can't read, you can't lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stating that he will promote the UNESCO agreement at the fourth African- African American summit in Harare in July, 1997, he said he plans to launch a 'Help Africa Campaign' involving governments, civic organizations and the private sector. UNESCO will assist with the organization of the next summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement calls for UNESCO and the three organizations to cooperate in the areas of basic education and literacy, including teacher training and curriculum development, higher education; promoting human rights and tolerance. Others are improving the status of women, science and technology development; and building communication capacities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of its main goals is to foster closer links between Africa and African Americans through educational and cultural exchanges, such as the establishment of UNESCO chairs at universities in Africa and in the United States, particularly at universities serving the African American community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizations will participate in UNESCO's Culture of Peace Programme in Africa by helping to provide education and training to demobilized soldiers and training local non-government organizations in the management of development and self-help programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan, long a key figure in the U.S. civil rights movement, was a leader in the battle against apartheid in South Africa. He is the author of the Sullivan Principles, a code of conduct for companies operating in South Africa during apartheid which advocated equal opportunity and an end to discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He founded OICI of America in 1964 to provide job and business training and five years later expanded the programme to Africa. IFESH was founded in the 1980s to involve American companies, institutions and individuals in education, health and economic development programs in Africa and now has numerous projects in over 30 countries in the continent and in Peru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1991, Sullivan has been organizing the African-African American summits to assist in development and influence policy decisions in economic and social development, democracy and peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - A renowned Nigerian author has revived the controversial debate on the origins of AIDS and accused United States scientists of inventing the incurable disease to reduce the Black population globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known simply as Chinweizu, the author, who is a newspaper columnist famous for his fierce social commentary, said in a lecture Friday that the American scientists now link AIDS with the African green monkey as part of the conspiracy to discredit the Black race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In order to disguise its origin some people started the disinformation that it (AIDS) infected humanity through green monkeys in central Africa,&quot; he said in Lagos while delivering a lecture on &quot;Black world collective security: Black redemption doctrines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinweizu said the grand conspiracy by developed countries against Africa was &quot;based on the model of too many men in a sinking the boat.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To save the rest, &quot; he said, &quot;you cast one third overboard to the circling sharks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the boat continues to sink,&quot; Chinweizu added, &quot;you select another one- third of those in it, and cast them overboard too. And you repeat the process until you get rid of enough to keep the boat afloat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social critic said Americans and Europeans chose &quot;Blacks as those to throw first to the sharks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Black Africa is a prime target for their population control squad despite its comparatively very low population density.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy on the origin of AIDS first raged in the 1980s, with Western scientists arguing that AIDS originated in Africa. Other scientists argued that it originated in the experimental laboratories of Western scientists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Nigerian author argued that in inventing the virus, the American scientists planned a systematic elimination of the &quot;inhabitants of an allegedly overcrowded spaceship earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the plan was &quot;to fashion a world in which a small minority can squander the earth's entire resources on themselves, and other minority are enslaved to serve them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Chinweizu, the conspirators &quot;intend for the Blacks exactly what the Nazis attempted on the Jews in Europe and what the Yankees inflicted on the native Americans and what Australians accomplished on the aboriginal Tasmanians, namely extermination and drastic depopulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For rather than use the nuclear bomb for the planned extermination, they have started with the AIDS bomb,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian author also accused the United Nations of being privy to the recolonization of Africa, perpetrated through agencies such the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the UN's job to keep the Black countries maldeveloped, unindustrialized and economically strangulated, to erode their sovereignty and turn them into de facto trust territories as a prelude to their being openly recolonized,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To stem the neocolonialism, Chinweizu said Black nations should &quot;reappraise our geographical situation, and thereby clear our minds of all manner of obfuscation, delusion and diversions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Black world should see the &quot;Eurocentric global order&quot; as a source of &quot;our strategic insecurity,&quot; hence the need for a &quot;a collective security alliance for the Black world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this end, the author said Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, should host in 1997 a &quot;Black redemption congress, to mobilize for the battle against recolonization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He volunteered to convene the congress under the auspices of the &quot;Black heritage and policy journal of the Black world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individuals, private organizations and governments of Black world are expected to attend the proposed meeting in Abuja, the Nigerian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinweizu also suggested that Nigeria organize a &quot;Black World League of Nations&quot; conference in 1999, after an expert meeting to clarify the principles, goals and organizational form of the league.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi (PANA) - The International Committee of the Red Cross says it will not return to Burundi until the killing of three of its personnel has been fully investigated, an official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We asked for a thorough investigation immediately after the attack,&quot; Patrick Berner, the agency's representative in Bujumbura, said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have returned to Burundi precisely in order to relaunch the investigations prior to the resumption of our activities in the country,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berner, who arrived in the Burundian capital on Saturday, said the killings of its officials June 6 were the first in the agency's history. The officials were killed in Cibitoke province, in northwest Burundi, where they had gone to supply drinking water to locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Red Cross was &quot;extremely worried by the events&quot; in eastern Zaire, where fighting between ethnic Tutsi rebels, known as the Banyamurenge, and the Zairian army has caused an exodus of hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees from 12 camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing reprisals from genocide against the Tutsi, these refugees fled Rwanda in 1994, following the victory of a largely Tutsi guerrilla force over a Hutu dominated government army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least one million people were killed and about two million others fled into exile, mostly to eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's troubled international soccer star, Nwankwo Kanu, alleged by Italian cardiologist to have a heart problem, can sue the doctors for breach of confidence, a leading Nigerian constitutional lawyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Ozekhome, also a human rights activist, told PANA in Lagos that &quot;the manner of disclosure&quot; of the star's alleged ailment was in breach of the patient/doctor relationship and smacked of a grand conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In legal parlance, the offense is known as &quot;Uberima Fidei&quot; or breach of fiduciary relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ozekhome said medical doctors are ethically prohibited by the Hippocratic oath to keep personal issues concerning their client's health strictly confidential unless they had the full consent of the patient.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kanu can sue them and his new club Inter Milan,&quot; Ozekhome said. There could, he added, even be greater grounds for damages if an independent examination reveals that Kanu is healthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, Western media reported on to the allegations of Kanu's ill- health based on the Italian doctors' diagnosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctors ruled Kanu unfit for future professional soccer, thereby provoking a huge controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a brilliant stint with European champions Ajax of Amsterdam, Kanu, 20, began moves to switch clubs just before the centennial Olympic in Atlanta '96, where he led Nigeria's under-23 team to win the soccer gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was obliged to take Ajax to court to obtain his release to the Italian club, Inter Milan, on slightly over a two-million-U.S.-dollar contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the fitness test by the doctors for Inter Milan that triggered the controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ezekhome said that even if Kanu was finally confirmed to have a weak aorta valve, he could still sue Ajax for negligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ezekhome said that the disclosures by the doctors for Inter Milan were the most damaging on Kanu. Ezekhome said that an independent assessment should have been conducted before the announcement was made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Premature disclosure, he said, amounted &quot;to killing Kanu's entire football career, thereby rendering him unmarketable and useless, and even denting his family's image, since heart ailment can be hereditary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ezekhome said, &quot;it could make any reasonable club shun him and his marketability will plummet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent medical opinion has also faulted the claims by the doctors for Inter Milan, saying that a surgery could rectify such an ailment, assuming Kanu has one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a pretty standard operation,&quot; said Dr. Michael Debakey, of the Baylor Medical Center in Houston, Texas, the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in an interview, Debakey said: &quot;Kanu should have a good result (after the operation), depending on his overall physical condition and his age.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debakey, a renowned cardiologist, said Kanu &quot;should be able to resume normal activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another American heart specialist, Dr. Adolph Hutter, said it was important to take a look at the player to evaluate the problem, adding &quot;the question is how bad it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctors are agreed that an independent opinion from that of the Italian doctors was needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nigeria, the government has pledged to underwrite Kanu's medical expenses to ascertain his true state of health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Youth and Sports Minister Jim Nwobodo, who lambasted the local press for &quot; exaggerating the player's predicament,&quot; supports an independent examination, preferably in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Nigerian Football Association has detailed a member of its medical team, Dr. Mohammed Muazu, to liaise with Inter Milan for a comprehensive report on the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment Kanu is saying very little. In his first press interview granted to a privately owned Nigerian radio he said &quot;there is nothing spectacular about my health.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accusing the media of blowing the issue out of proportion, Kanu said &quot;the stories written about my heart problem have been over blown. They (media) kept on writing about me as if there was no other thing to write.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am alright. There is no problem with me. Inter Milan has not dropped me,&quot; Kanu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His parents have also expressed concern, dismissing the alleged health problem as an orchestrated campaign by those who do not wish Nigeria and their son well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The pain is simply excruciating! There is the risk of death from excessive bleeding or from tetanus or some strange infection. There are even risks in child birth on account of the scar from the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others from societies in which the practice does not exist can only express horror at the details of the operation. Those who have been through the operation speak of the trauma of the whole experience and how they would not want to inflict such misery on their own daughters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This operation otherwise seen as sheer misery is none other but female circumcision (excision, clitoridectomy, infibulation) -- give it any name, but the fact remains, according to women's rights activists and medical personnel, it is female genital mutilation (FGM). They argue that when external genitals are normal, there can be no reasons, medical, moral or aesthetic for removing all or any of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Kanga, a history teacher in Nairobi says it is wrong to fully discredit the cultural reasons for female circumcision because, he argues, &quot; these women, though uneducated, are highly intelligent, creative individuals who are just as aware of the inevitability of social change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently for female circumcision, men on the other hand generally speak of the elimination of the sexual urge and preservation of chastity in women.  But then, one wonders why there is never need to curb the sexual urge in men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finda Mbriwa (not her real name) from Sierra Leone, who has undergone circumcision and says she can perform the operation by virtue of her age and experience as an elder, defends the practice, saying it is a rite of passage from childhood to womanhood and that it is directly linked to fertility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one interesting argument Mbriwa puts across is that if the baby's head touched the clitoris during child birth, it would die. The question is, says who?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biological facts of reproduction continue to be the best kept secrets in many parts of Africa, often distorted by damaging myths, taboos and fears that threaten and debase the lives and dignity of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure to learn about the natural biological process of giving life or how a baby is made, are still the cause of great suffering, pain and tragedy - quite needlessly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Christine from Kenya's Maasai tribe where female circumcision is practised widely, says she feels &quot;more of a woman&quot; and that she is respected in her society as a full grown woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, it is often difficult, even impossible for those who do not belong to a given culture, to fully appreciate the implications as well as the significance of aspects of that culture, and understand why even enlightened members of that society choose to conform against the judgement that female circumcision is obviously a painful and dangerous experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Jane Auko, a sales girl in Nairobi, is disturbed by the argument that female circumcision is meant to preserve chastity in women. Obviously irritated, she asks why women should on the overall continue to succumb to the whims of men who are naturally the decision makers in matters pertaining to culture and traditional practices under which female circumcision falls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mid-wife at one of Kenya's leading hospitals says that the female external reproductive organs are &quot;normal, healthy organs&quot; and each has its own function to perform either during sexual relations, labour, child birth and post-partum, therefore none of them is a mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk about reproduction, millions of women and girls continue to live in fear and ignorance of their own bodies and life-giving functions. A recent World Health Organization (WHO) report indicates that every year about 2 million females are at risk of being mutilated. The report says that Sierra Leone and Liberia still widely incorporate female circumcision in their secret societies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A research carried out in Kenya by the Programme for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) last August revealed that the practice is still emphasised among the Kisii, Maasai, Samburu and Meru. Up to nearly 50 per cent of the women in this East African state are circumcised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A programme officer for PATH, Mr. Samson Radeny says that even the educated, including medical personnel, are involved in the practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radeny says that parents send their daughters to the village at the age of seven for circumcision whether they are in school or not. He notes however, that some tribes like the Kikuyu had abandoned the practice because the church stepped in with threats to excommunicate those Christians involved in circumcision and also following the ban on female circumcision by President Daniel arap Moi in 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PATH is a non-governmental organization (NGO) dedicated to offering technical assistance in improving the reproductive health of women. The programme has been very active in anti-female circumcision campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining the medical dangers of female circumcision, Dr. Gerald Aine, a private practising gynaecologist, says after the operation, the external reproductive organs heal with a scar which consists of fibrous, non-elastic tissues which does not yield during child birth, thus making labour prolonged and sometimes obstructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Aine, during this period, referred to as the second stage of labour, the head of the baby is already in the vagina, but the opening of the birth canal is closed by the unyielding scar tissue of circumcision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Aine says the constant prolonged grinding of the baby's head on the mother's urinary bladder on top and the rectum behind causes fistula (uncontrollable passing out of urine and faeces). This is not bed wetting which occurs in boys and girls up to the age of nine to ten years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Aine adds that fistula is common in adolescent girls and it is extremely difficult for some of these women to give birth to a live child if the fistula is not repaired. If by chance they become pregnant, urine poisons the foetus, causing frequent miscarriages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But not all circumcised women end up with fistula,&quot; stresses Dr. Aine. But many still wonder why womanhood training including family education, sex education and child rearing should not be continued and made the most valuable aspects of female initiation. One would imagine the pangs of child birth alone would suffice the ability to endure pain and the qualification of &quot;being a woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndola, Zambia - The names of founders of the Association of Christian Lay Centres in Africa (ACLCA) read out during silver jubilee celebrations held in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, from October 6 to 13 read like who is who in an ecumenical book of records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include Mrs. Winnifred Sibusisiwe, the widow of South African church minister, the late Rev. Enos Sikakane; former general secretary of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), Rev. Dr. Maxime Rafransoa from Madagascar, Nigerian clergy Rt. Rev. Adeolu Adegbola; Ugandan Rev. Erastus Bitarabeho; Zambian Canon Jason Mfula; South African Rev. Dale White; and Egyptian Rev. Dr. Samuel Habib.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These were the people, who planted the first seeds of the current ACLCA, whose 25 years of pastoral service among the laity in Africa we are celebrating today,&quot; remarked the association's Executive Secretary Rev. Jonah Katoneene, as he read out the names for recognition and awards-giving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the challenging theme, Celebrating in Hope: Restoring Just Relationships, the 200 delegates, drawn mainly from member centres of the association and invited guests from the ecumenical church partners and regional lay associations both from Africa and Europe, met in Harare for the week-long silver jubilee celebrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But contrary to what one would have expected -- continuous merry- making, the occasion created a forum for delegates to look back and plan for the future, among other deliberations. Nevertheless, they dedicated one evening to cultural activities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues at hand for deliberations were as wide and central for both the African continent and its people as they were for the church and its pastoral mission among the African people. They covered such spheres as human rights, implication of global disintegration, drug trafficking and abuse, gospel and culture, inter-religious dialogue, church as a healing ministry to the vulnerable, ethnicity and conflict resolution skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other items included on the ACLCA agenda were street children, rape, landlessness, and homelessness; the position of women and youth; the effects of HIV/ Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), liberalization of economies and their effects, militarisation, destabilisation, overcoming a culture of violence, confrontation and structural adjustment programmes and their effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Definitely we would have done alot of disservice to ourselves if we simply met here to make merry without taking stock of what God has helped us achieve so far, and at the same time focus on the challenges ahead of us,&quot; noted the ACLCA president Rev. Sipho Masemola from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with APS, Rev. Masemola talked of the diversified issues facing the lay person in the church, key among them lack of recognition as a &quot; powerful tool&quot; within some church hierarchies. He cited destitution, civil strife, famine, up-rootedness and economic hardships, as odds that must be addressed by the ACLCA celebration programme, otherwise &quot;we would not have accomplished our mission of celebrating in hope and restoring just relationships.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And true to their commitment, delegates, who also included representatives of ecumenical partners, such as the World Council of Churches (WCC), the AACC and a number of regional Christian lay associations in Africa and Europe, proposed the way forward for ACLCA's commitment in the laity's pastoral ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A significant resolution was the launching of a trust fund, which will help the association raise money locally for its financial requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The launching of this fund is in line with our long thinking that in future things will not be as they are today. We shall be forced to stand on ourselves in terms of financial commitment for our pastoral programmes. Our financial wells are slowly drying up in Europe and we must start thinking seriously on how to effectively stand on our two feet,&quot; emphasised Rev.  Masemola, while launching the ACLCA Trust Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the week-long celebrations, participants instituted a covenant of commitment which raised several concerns that ACLCA should commit itself to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACLCA covenant of commitment included 26 items, among them the urgent need to define and articulate a new multi-faith environmental ethic derived from traditional African concepts, principles and practices, which provide for peaceful co-existence between man and nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegates recommended that ACLCA member centres should be models of communities which are inclusive, tolerant and safe with one another.  According to the covenant, centres should incorporate civil society in the training curricula. The delegates lamented that recent events in Africa have shown that an active and informed civil society is crucial for managing power transfers from authoritarian to more accountable models of governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACLCA covenant noted with concern that Africa is becoming &quot;rich and has plentiful&quot; supply of cheap sex for tourists, who generally prey on the vulnerable girls, boys and women and intensify unnatural relationships in the name of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We categorically say that we are not poor. We must forever banish the demon of poverty and work hard to prosper and make others prosper,&quot; said the ACLCA delegates in their statement of commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observing that globalisation of world economies has undermined national sovereignty and the power of leaders to take charge of their economies, the ACLCA covenant pointed out; &quot;This makes a mockery of accountability for leaders who lose their role of planners and implementers of development policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegates called on centres to encourage debate on globalisation and seek to educate people on its effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACLCA meeting also raised concern on the family which it classified as &quot; under attack,&quot; saying its centrality as a basic building block of society is being undermined. There is need to insist on the sanctity and role of family as an institution for socialization in its fuller sense, participants noted in the covenant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lay centres were also called upon to be steadfast in ensuring that the church defines and redefines the methods of its mission, noting that the purpose of mission is un-changing. A church which lacks a clear identity and sense of mission has no business engaging in dialogue of any kind, the delegates stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying that the process of democratization which gained momentum in the early 1990s has given hope to millions in Africa, the ACLCA meeting called for the institution of a large scale civic education programme if a similar pace is to be maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emphasizing that in the past 25 years, ACLCA has worked to empower the laity, the delegates noted; &quot;We have now come of age and need to proceed further to tackle civil and economic issues. A greater and more decisive mandate from the church is needed by the centres for greater autonomy to get on with the job of laity formation. We regard the mission of the laity as being an integral part of the mission of the church.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivering her key-note speech, Rev. Dr. Eunice Santana, a president of the World Council of Churches, challenged the church in Africa to accommodate Christian organizations such as ACLCA as part of the pastoral mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such organizations like ACLCA are vital, especially where they come in as empowering agents for the lay people, she observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Santana also challenged ACLCA to strive to work harder for the lay people on the African continent, cautioning that in the future, issues and duties will hardly be minimized but on the contrary will increase, hence the need to redouble efforts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A showdown appears to be in the offing between Burundi's military junta and East African regional leaders following the junta's call on October 14 for the lifting of an economic embargo imposed on the war-torn central African nation last July, as a precondition for talks with extremist rebels from the Hutu majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 12, a regional summit gave Burundi's warring Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority one month to start peace talks and expressed its readiness to take &quot;appropriate measures&quot; against any group refusing to participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call by the summit which grouped the presidents of Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia, the prime ministers of Zaire and Ethiopia, the foreign minister of Cameroon, the secretary general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and mediator Julius Nyerere, Tanzania's founding president, came as Tutsi strongman Pierre Buyoya and former Interior Minister Leonard Nyangoma, the main guerrilla leader, both offered to enter into such talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regional leaders also said they wanted a full return to constitutional order and said that Nyerere had received a written assurance from Buyoya, saying he was ready to negotiate with Nyangoma's group, the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), and all other armed factions in the three-year-old civil war, which has already left 150,000 people dead, most of them civilians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter from Nyangoma to the summit said: &quot;I solemnly declared herewith that despite all odds, the CNDD is ready to enter into open negotiations with the Burundi military junta immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regional leaders maintained Burundi's economic blockade imposed a week after a July 25 military coup by the Tutsi-dominated army which ousted Hutu president Sylvestre Ntibatunganya and installed Major Buyoya in his place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final communique read out before the assembled heads of state and government in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha said the regional countries would send a ministerial delegation to the Burundian capital, Bujumbura, to evaluate the situation &quot;and take appropriate action,&quot; and called for preliminary talks to start immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on October 14, the head of the government formed after the July 25 military coup, Prime Minister Pascal-Firmin Ndimira, said they would not talk to the rebels &quot;so long as the blockade has not been lifted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are predisposed and still determined to enter negotiations, but not in the framework of a blockade,&quot; Ndimira said, pointing out that the embargo &quot; endangered the peace process and encouraged the (rebel) armed factions, while the government's hands are tied.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government denounces a plot by those, who in the name of democracy, continued to serve their own interests. Some countries are seeking to stifle the Burundian people,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndimira described the embargo as &quot;illegal, unjust and biased&quot; and said it had already cost one of the world's poorest countries &quot;a loss of income of more than 162 million dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional heads of state decided on October 12 at the Arusha summit to maintain the embargo and gave the parties to the conflict between the army and the rebels, one month to open peace talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who visited Arusha a day earlier, had made it clear that the United States favoured easing the sanctions, and praised a recent decision by Buyoya to lift his suspension of political parties and parliament. &quot;When we see progress, we must be ready to recognise it,&quot; Christopher pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bujumbura, former Burundian president Jean-Baptiste Bagaza said the decision to maintain the sanctions was a &quot;disaster&quot; which would widen the breach between Hutus and Tutsis and could spark riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The embargo is hitting the most disadvantaged, poorest and weakest people in society. Normally, such measures are taken against belligerent states.  This is not the case in Burundi,&quot; said Bagaza, who was president from 1976 to 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hutus make up 85 per cent of Burundi's population of 5.5 million people, but are mostly peasant farmers, while the Tutsis, at 14 per cent, control the armed forces, big business and political decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sanctions, crippling an already war-battered economy, have been hitting the urbanized Tutsis harder than most Hutus, who have always lived at subsistence level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndimira's support for the lifting of sanctions came amid reports of further raids blamed on rebels and fighting in several parts of the central African highland nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 13, a grenade attack killed two people and injured 29 in a crowded market in the south-eastern Rutana province of Burundi, which is fraught with ethnic violence, the national radio reported. It quoted a member of the military general staff as blaming the attack on the Hutu rebels fighting the Tutsi-dominated army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radio, quoting a local correspondent, also said that Hutu rebels killed 23 villagers at Burambi in the south-west on October 11, bringing down the death toll in the massacre from 40 as originally reported. Six children have disappeared but 28 other people who had gone missing have been found, it reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 14, soldiers were also exchanging fire with Hutu rebels on the hills overlooking the capital Bujumbura, military spokesman Lt.Col. Isaie Nibizi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nibizi said that a new battalion of more than 400 men was taking up positions in the Nyambuye district, about 15 kilometres east of the capital, where rebel bands were shooting to harass them. He also confirmed that a local administrator was killed last October 9 at Kibuye in the northern Kayanza province. His death was first reported on the night of October 13 by the national radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army is pursuing an operation against the rebels in the Kibira mountains, close to Kayanza, where the latter have set up several bases, and troops are also moving against the rebels at Murambi in the south-western Bururi province, which has led to the displacement of large numbers of civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The developments on the long-drawn ethnic conflict in Burundi came as Christopher was about to complete a week-long tour of Africa aimed at enhancing Washington's role in the continent, but which was largely seen as a failure after the attempts failed to win over African leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher visited five countries on his tour, beginning with former French West Africa in what was seen as a deliberate challenge to the former colonial power, and ending in war-torn Angola, a former Portuguese colony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher's efforts to win support for a US-sponsored African peace force, a successor to Boutros Boutros-Ghali as United Nations leader, an easing of sanctions against Burundi or sanctions against Nigeria, met with a cool response or even outright sceptism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most leaders showed polite interest when Christopher asked them to take part in an African Crisis Response Force - a standing peacekeeping force made up of 10,000 African troops which would protect civilians in areas of conflict. But only Mali and Ethiopia appeared inclined to join.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mali, the first country on Christopher's itinerary, gave its agreement in principle but made no formal commitment. Christopher lavished praise on Mali's fledgling democracy and pledged financial aid to finance elections next year and the resettlement of former Tuareg rebels in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His visit to Bamako was taken as a signal to France that Washington now felt free to stake its claim to countries which traditionally fell within the French &quot;sphere of influence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A US diplomat in Bamako said that in Mali, &quot;France is the first wife, the one they did not choose. We are the second, who is often the favourite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ethiopia where he outlined the peace force plan, leaders of the continental body said the plan needed further consultations and clarifications, notably about who would command the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim objected to Washington's insistence that only countries &quot;with an experience of democracy&quot; should take part in the force, saying it should be a pan-African force and it was not up to the Americans to decide which countries could join.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In talks with African leaders in Arusha on Burundi, Christopher pressed for an easing of sanctions against Burundi's military junta to reward Buyoya for political concessions, but Burundi's neighbours ruled the sanctions should stay and set an ultimatum for Buyoya to open talks with Hutu rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, President Nelson Mandela was unenthusiastic about a Washington-sponsored peace force, saying such a force should be convened by the United Nations or the OAU rather than the United States. &quot;I would like the whole process to come through the UN,&quot; Mandela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African president appeared to give Christopher a cool reception and the peace force issue was not the only one on which they disagreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela told the US Secretary of State that South Africa was joining many other African leaders in supporting UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros- Ghali's re-election at the UN, despite strong US opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher was thought to be seeking another African candidate during his tour. Salim Ahmed Salim was mentioned as a possibility, but turned it down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African leaders said they would not budge on that issue before Washington formally vetoed Boutros-Ghali's re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher's efforts to muster support for sanctions against Nigeria's military regime for its alleged human rights abuses also encountered a muted response, forcing him to sound a warning in Johannesburg that Washington would take &quot;appropriate&quot; steps against Nigeria if that country failed to restore democracy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ganvie, Benin - Thanks to profound democratic reforms and economic liberalization, the West African state of Benin, formerly a Marxist military dictatorship, boasts of a new reputation today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the inhabitants of a unique village, Ganvie, as elsewhere in Africa and like the majority of the 5 million Beninois in general, have nothing to show for these changes especially in economic terms and the infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Popularly known as the capital city of the &quot;people of the water&quot;, Ganvie village is located in the north-western end of Lake Nokoue, a few kilometres from Cotonou, the commercial capital of the tiny Republic of Benin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a population of about 23,000 inhabitants, Ganvie is the largest lake of the Toffini, locally referred to as people of the water. It is believed to be among the biggest and better known water- villages in the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean-Claude Gnouloufoun (read Nyolofoo), 50 was born and raised in Ganvie village. In his lifetime he has witnessed some significant progress in the village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include among others, a primary and subsequently secondary school and more recently a dispensary and clinic. All these are, however, church- sponsored developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A steady, but still relatively small number of tourist visitors, is one of the more visible developments since Benin acquired the reputation as the &quot; cradle of the African democratic reform movement,&quot; following the 1991 multiparty elections that saw a peaceful transition from one-party rule.  Carvers and other handicrafters are beginning to cash-in on this flow of visitors as is, and perhaps even more so, the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the move to promote tourism further, the government constructed a new guest house in the village as it prepared to host the sixth summit of the French-speaking countries of the world in December, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is significant that the event was successful. Among prominent participants were Jacques Chirac, President of France and the Prime Minister of Canada, Jean Chretien, who is from the French province of Quebec.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It takes about one hour to travel to the village by a dug-out canoe, boat or craft from Abomey-Calavi, 19 kilometres from Cotonou, where the government has built a wooden loading platform. By motorized boat, the ride takes about 30 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the old and young from the age of six are expert canoeists. Sole women canoeists with children on their backs and their canoes fully loaded, can be seen steering their &quot;vehicles&quot; with rare expertise, especially in the &quot; highway&quot; to the village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canoes carrying merchandise to or from the village are so heavily loaded that their edges touch the level of the water. In the hands of an ordinary operator, these canoes would certainly tip over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the village itself, hawkers carry on their house-to-house business in canoes. And as would be expected, school children roar to and from their schools daily without any assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents at the Department of Tourism indicate that the Toffini led by their Chief Agbogbre, first founded Ganvie in the 18th century as a hideout from the wars of succession in the Kingdom of Allada and Dan-Home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of religious beliefs, their pursuers could not go after them in or beyond the lake. The Toffini, it is said, were also the victims of demographic explosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially they hid in the outlying forests in the swamps whose arrangement of trees and branches provided them with a natural habitat. Erosion and deforestation, however, soon forced them to adopt man-made structures suitable to their environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meaning of the name Ganvie supports this theory. Gan expresses relief and can be interpreted to mean &quot;we are saved,&quot; while Vie means community.  Hence &quot;we are the saved community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fishing comes to the Toffini naturally. They have also acquired a rare skill in breeding fish, a profession that may start as early as at the age of six. The fish farms are to be found in natural breeding grounds which are skillfully turned into farms to trap and retain more fish than would otherwise breed in the natural setting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from tourism, fishing is the other activity that has expanded during this new era that has given Benin a new more liberal disposition. The fishing farms are now larger and most households have more than one such farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Household incomes have, as a result, improved slightly; more people have radio sets while a few have television sets, Jean Claude Gnouloufoun told APS.  A lady dealer lights her handicrafts' shop using solar energy. There is also engine generated power in some houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite these developments, the overwhelming majority of people live in abject poverty, in houses laid on hard teak-wood poles planted in the muddy bottom of the lake. The homes hardly have any household property to speak of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for canoes, these are items of absolute necessity. And since individual errands do not always coincide, it is important for each household to have more than one canoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The houses are built with bamboo walls and floors and roofed with palm leaves. The teak is rot-proof though poles may be replaced alternatively after several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanitation as has always been, remains a major problem with raw sewage and refuse from the houses draining in the water. With growing population, the lake and the air is increasingly becoming more polluted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water is another problem that has refused to go away. The village has one source of water that was constructed during colonial times when the population was much smaller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gnouloufoun, a dealer in handicrafts, believes the population is still set to increase. &quot;Fewer and fewer people are migrating from the village because land is less available elsewhere in the country,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The village is dotted with a few tiny and medium-sized patches of land and swampy grass fields that are not navigable. The Toffini have taken full advantage of these patches to construct some of their houses partly on land, partly in water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The houses are approached from ladders suspended from the entrance into the mud. Some houses, despite their simplicity, have beautiful balconies overlooking the &quot;streets&quot; of the village of which &quot;Lovers Lane&quot; is the most famous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The swamps provide a natural breeding place for mosquitoes, but which are only a nuisance at night. The villagers claim to be immune to mosquito bites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless this is one of the &quot;many, many inherent problems of living on water&quot; that inhabitants say &quot;government should address using income earned from tourism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One advantage of this habitat, however, says a handicrafts' dealer, is that thefts are rare while street muggers are unknown. &quot;Here, it is not easy to make a quick escape or hasty retreat.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luanda - Fears of possible resumption of war in Angola have prompted Southern African regional leaders to urge former Angolan rebel chief Jonas Savimbi to help move forward the peace process by coming to the Angolan capital, Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call came on October 2 after Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos told a Southern African Development Community (SADC) heads of state summit in Luanda, that his country was still between war and peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-day SADC summit, held under the chairmanship of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, and included Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Fredrick Chiluba of Zambia and Joachim Chissano of Mozambique, another former Portuguese colony in southern Africa ravaged by a long civil war that finally ended with a military and political settlement in 1992, issued a statement expressing concern at the slow pace of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savimbi, head of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which fought the ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) from independence in 1975, did not take up an invitation to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the summit, Dos Santos said Angola was &quot;at the crossroads between war and peace&quot; following the signing of political and military protocols by the two rival sides in Lusaka, Zambia, in November 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going through a crisis of confidence because of the systematic delays in the implementation of the peace pact. This summit will be decisive for our interlocutors to realise that they have everything to gain from honest and constructive cooperation,&quot; Dos Santos said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tight security was laid on for the summit, where Mugabe made no secret of his disappointment at Savimbi's failure to come. But the central Angola-based ex-guerrilla chief, who has expressed fears for his safety in Luanda, has not visited the capital since renewed civil war broke out after UNITA lost elections to the MPLA in 1992, and he has turned down a proposal by the government that he should become vice-president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portuguese Defence Minister Antonio Victorino, who is visiting Angola to discuss military cooperation, said Savimbi had missed a &quot;unique opportunity&quot; to help speed up the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Angolan government and UNITA are still struggling to reach agreement on the formation of a government of national unity after Savimbi refused to become vice-president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Lusaka, negotiators spelt out in detail the steps for encamping and disarming troops of the rival sides and the formation of a new joint army, as well as of UNITA's participation in government and the administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, they left Savimbi's role to one side to press ahead with a peace settlement and simply provided for him to have &quot;special status&quot;, but Savimbi still reckons that &quot;the moment is not right&quot; to go to Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SADC leaders could thus only make recommendations to encourage the two sides to find a way of working together until new elections can be held. In all, 70 UNITA deputies were elected in September 1992 for a four-year term.  They were heavily outnumbered by MPLA deputies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dos Santos beat Savimbi in a first round of presidential elections but just failed to win the 50 per cent majority needed to avoid a run-off round, which has never been held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations, which has sent some 7,000 troops to Angola to oversee the application of the 1994 peace accords, has repeatedly denounced the slow pace of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 2, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali criticised Savimbi's apparent boycott of the SADC summit, noting that had the latter come to Luanda for the meeting which would have been his first with Dos Santos on Angolan territory, the implementation of the 1994 peace pacts would have been accelerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, all 63,000 soldiers of the former rebel UNITA movement have finally been registered in camps across Angola as a key stage in the demobilization process, the UN's special representative in Angola, Alioune Blondin Beye announced on September 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And reporting on October 7 to the UN Security Council in New York, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said he planned to begin reducing the number of UN peacekeepers in Angola by the end of 1996 despite &quot;considerable delays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process of encampment began in November 1995, and by September 26, 63, 006 former UNITA guerrillas had been registered in 15 UN- supervised camps across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 11,000 former UNITA soldiers have left the camps, complaining of intolerable conditions, but according to the UN Unit for Coordination of Humanitarian Aid, hundreds are returning to claim the 646 US dollars that will be granted to every demobilised soldier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demobilisation process began on September 24, despite the delay in completing the encampment, with the return of a group of 466 soldiers aged under 18 years to their native regions. Around 6,000 soldiers aged less than 18 fought with UNITA. Some 37,000 UNITA troops are due to be demobilised in all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 5,000 soldiers were also selected to join a 90,000-strong Angolan defence force which will eventually include 26,300 UNITA soldiers and 63,700 government troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the military plan, the next step will involve formal establishment of the new army and the creation of its general staff, which is set to include 10 generals from UNITA ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, UNITA has so far failed to keep a promise to send the 10 to Luanda.  Only five of them, including UNITA chief of staff General Arlindo Chenda Pena, known as &quot;Ben Ben,&quot; are currently in the capital. The later is to become deputy commander of the joint defence force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mandate of the UN Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) is scheduled to end next February, but problems in implementing the Lusaka peace protocol, signed in Zambia in November 1994, persist also on the political front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implementation of the military aspects of the Lusaka protocols is well under way, but some UNITA troops still have to be disarmed and the former rebels must hand in all their heavy weaponry to the UN mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the political front, the Lusaka pact gave UNITA four cabinet portfolios in the government and seven deputy ministerial posts, as well as diplomatic positions. UNITA deputies elected to parliament late in 1992 under a first peace deal have to take up their seats there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the UN mission has been dissatisfied with the quantity of arms turned in by UNITA, saying that it found the numbers totally insufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 16, UNITA gave the UNAVEM III 14 tonnes of shells, seven artillery pieces, including obsolete anti-aircraft batteries, two rocket launchers and a heavy machine-gun, with a local UNITA commander, General Numa Kamalata saying: &quot;Our men did not have modern weapons. All that we have are weapons captured from our enemies of yesterday, our brothers today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kamalata, who headed UNITA troops in the four provinces of the north, Bengo, Kwanza-Norte, Uije and Zaire, said that soldiers there only possessed a total of two tanks, 42 heavy artillery pieces and 50 tonnes of shells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commander of UN peacekeeping troops in the southern African country, Zimbabwean General Philip Sibanda, urged UNITA to hand over considerable quantities of weapons during the next disarmament operation in the north-east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am hoping to see more weapons and tanks,&quot; he said during the hand-over at Ntuku, which was not attended by representatives of the Luanda government, which has criticised the small amounts and poor quality of the arms so far surrendered by the ex-guerrillas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Is the African church well equipped for its enormous pastoral challenges as it bids farewell to the 20th century and welcomes the next millennium? What issues are likely to set the agenda for the 21st century African church as it endeavours to evangelise to people overwhelmed with social economic, political and even religious problems?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Catholic church, the goal seems set --how to effectively &quot; inculturate&quot; the Christian message to reflect the social, economic, religious and cultural needs of the African people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recently published book, Ecclesia (the church) in Africa, under the sub-title, Urgent Need for Inculturation, Pope John Paul I I, referring to the recommendations reached at the first ever synodal assembly for African bishops, says; &quot;On several occasions, the synod Fathers stressed the particular importance for evangelisation of inculturation, the process by which catechists take flesh in the various cultures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic pontiff explains inculturation in two dimensions -- the intimate transformation of authentic cultural values through their integration in Christianity, and the insertion of Christianity in the various human cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The historic special assembly for the African Catholic bishops considers inculturation an urgent priority in the life of the particular churches for a firm rooting of the gospel in Africa, notes the Pope.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ecclesia in Africa singles out inculturation as a requirement for evangelisation, terming it one of the greatest challenges for the church on the continent on the eve of the next millennium. Contents of his recent book form part of the recommendations and key issues raised by the historic assembly for the African synod held in Rome from April 10 to May 8, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Njeru Wambugu, a Kenyan and leader of a local independent church, commenting on the book by the Catholic pontiff told APS in an interview; &quot;I agree with the Catholic pontiff and the entire Catholic hierarchy on the African continent that inculturation of the gospel message in respect of the African traditional values is one of the most effective ways to evangelise the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bishop Wambugu, who is also the General Secretary of the Organization of African Instituted Churches (OAIC) says &quot;the (Catholic) church might have come out a bit late on the issue, however it is better late than never.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is hopeful that through inculturation, the Catholic church as well as the mainline churches, will come face to face with African realities like celibacy and polygamy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, most of the mainline churches have tended to either downplay or ignore some central issues that govern the life of the African, both inside and outside their religious faith, Bishop Wambugu says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior lecturer in religious studies at the Nairobi University, Kenya, Dr.  Hannah Kinoti in an article published in a recent publication, Violence against Women: Reflections by Kenyan Women Theologians, says early Christian missionaries among Kenya's Kikuyu community, held the general outlook of the 19th century missionaries that everything in non-Christian religions and cultures was evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was an outlook which particularly denied any culture of value in Africa.  &quot; In their perceived double mission to evangelise and civilize the African, the missionaries believed that it was their duty to overhaul African culture, observes Dr. Kinoti who is a member of the Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians (CCAWT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individual missions and missionaries who worked among the Kikuyu (Kenya's largest ethnic group, mainly inhabitants of the Central Province) may have differed in the degree to which they condemned the local culture, but this general attitude dominated their activities, Dr. Kinoti argues in her article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic bishops in Malawi have focussed on incluturation in their latest pastoral letter dated September 14 under the title, Walking Together in Faith; Our Journey Towards the Year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Malawian Catholic clergy point out that &quot;our Christianity was taught and we received it through the European and American missionaries, many of whom found little to be admired in our Malawian, African cultures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They (missionaries) could not see Malawian cultures as a medium for Christianity, therefore their preaching could not avoid wholesale condemnations of local customs and institutions, the bishops lament, saying this made many Christians to feel like strangers in their own culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stating that the process of inculturation involves and touches the whole of life -- customs, values, liturgy, theology and church structures among others, the bishops challenge the local hierarchy and the faithful to do more than talk about it. They ask them to be &quot;actually living, praying, and worshipping following our cultures, while allowing the same cultures to be purified and inspired by gospel values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Malawian bishops recommend an intensive research and study, which they point out, would contribute towards discovering direction and guidance in inculturating the faith and gospel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We, as a conference and as individuals will encourage and oversee this work at national and diocesan levels according to our competence,&quot; the bishops elaborate. They have also requested experts in liturgy, theology and other disciplines to be resourceful, daring and respectful of authentic Christian and cultural values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must heed the exhortation of the Holy Father who reminds us that inculturation is essential for evangelisation,&quot; the bishops add.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his pastoral visit to Kenya in 1994, the spiritual leader of the worldwide Anglican community, the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr. George Carey, touched on incorporating culture but from a different perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His was an apology to the African Anglicans for having been evangelized through the English culture by the early missionaries. &quot;I do apologise to Africans over the way the Anglican church imposed English traditions on the continent, while ignoring the African culture,&quot; said Dr. Carey, late 1994, then a guest of the (Anglican) Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) in celebrations marking its 150 years in this East African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on the subject, The Mission of the Anglican Community in the 21st Century, the Anglican Archbishop noted that the mistake was made somehow out of ignorance by honourable people who were not only committed to evangelising the continent but ready to die for their faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr.Carey, however, noted that the early missionaries may not have been as informed and aware as we ar today on the riches of African cultures and traditional values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And writing on Contextual Theology: A Basic Need Within the Churches in Africa Today the African Ecclesial Review -, published by the Catholic bishops in Central and Eastern Africa, Victor Chendekemen Yakubu, a Nigerian seminarian offers advice on how to accomplish the inculturation of the Christian message in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of lamenting about the Euro-American cultural models used by the early missionaries when evangelising Africa, the main concern should be to rediscover through these cultures what the gospel proclaimed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yakubu argues that churches ought to strive to develop new trends in teaching their peoples the essence of Christianity within the local context by using the structure, personnel and policies already existing in the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian seminarian advocates for detachment from &quot;the North Atlantic captivity of the Church&quot; to an African theological model in doctrine, liturgy, theology, personnel and even name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No theology is taken seriously if it ignores the surrounding social misery.  The African bishops rejected the theology of adaptation (the attempt to adapt traditional Western theology to other cultures) and accepted the theology of incarnation (the attempt to explain the Christian religion in traditional thought patterns in the light of the &quot;word became flesh and dwelt among us&quot; (John 1:14)), he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian ends his paper by evoking the sentiments of Pope John VI and Pope John Paul II on inculturation of the Christian message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quoting Pope John Paul II, he says; &quot;A faith that does not become culture is a faith that is not fully accepted, completely thought on, and truly lived on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Pope Paul VI, he adds; &quot;The gospel is an incarnation of the Christian life and message in an actual cultural area in such a way that this experience can be expressed not only in the elements of the cultures in question, but it becomes the inspiring, normative and unifying principle that transforms and recreates this culture, giving rise to a new creation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE (APS) OCTOBER 14 - The Church in Africa has a duty to continue giving hope, where hopelessness has reigned; feed, where hunger has prevailed, clothe, where nakedness is affecting people, shelter where people have been shelterless and heal, where diseases have become the order of the day, a president of the World Council of Churches (WCC) has said here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivering a key-note speech during the Silver Jubilee celebrations of the Association of Lay Christian Centres in Africa (ACLCA), held here from October 6 to 13, Dr. Eunice Santana, said some of the social, economic and political issues prevailing on the Africa continent, had made many of the African people to become hopeless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was therefore the duty of the church on the continent to continue to instill hope where destitution among other sufferings, have prevailed, she stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like in Caribbean and Latin American countries, the African continent is affected by many odds such as hunger and violation of human rights, and churches should chip in their contribution to eradicate them, she further told the huge gathering of nearly 200 delegates, who attended the occasion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing women and youth as an example, the WCC president, who hails from Puerto Rico said, &quot;there were numerous odds that militated against women and youth and the church should direct its pastoral attention to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to UN statistics, Rev. Dr. Santana noted there are currently about 26 million African girls who are out of school due to divergent reasons, chief among them lack of school fees or early pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The figure is expected to rise to 36 million by the turn of the century,&quot; she further told the ACLCA meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegates included national coordinators and directors of the member lay Christian centres of the ACLCA, the founders of the ACLCA and invited fraternal guests from various parts of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Silver Jubilee celebrations, which also coincided with the general assembly of the pan-African Christian Association, were celebrated under the theme: Celebrating in Hope; Restoring Just Relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Silver Jubilee celebrations, which also coincided with the general assembly of the pan-African Christian Association, were celebrated under the theme: Celebrating in Hope; Restoring Just Relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying that the church has always tried its best to alleviate people's sufferings, Rev. Dr. Santana regretted that &quot;sometimes, lack of political will to accompany this, has failed the church in reaching its goal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that WCC has decided to hold its 8th General Assembly in Zimbabwe in 1998, was a clear sign that the global ecumenical organization was trying to come closer to the African Christians. &quot;We must respond to this gesture by playing a vital role before and during the general assembly,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Rev. Santana the church would lose a lot if she failed to be a community based institution. &quot;The church needs the faithful's support, much as they (the faithful) need the church's support,&quot; she emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the same gathering, General Secretary of the Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) Rev. Murombedzi Chikanga Kuchera said of the ACLCA; &quot;25 years is a long time and reaching this milestone meant hard work, patience and persistence.&quot; However, he added, the next 25 years leading to the golden jubilee, will not be simple considering the speed and space at which the technological world is flying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emphasizing the need to be sensitive to the plight of women, youth and the marginalized, Rev. Kuchera said it was no use talking about the rights of women without arming and equipping them with the necessary tools such as education, which they can use to develop the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivering a sermon during the official opening of the celebrations, Lt.  Colonel Stuart Mungate said &quot;Africa needs to sing a new song which brings in the new heaven and the new earth with the holy city of God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lamented that people's minds are obsessed with greed, thinking only about self while caring little about the suffering of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt. Colonel Mungate of the Salvation Army Church (Zimbabwe), listed disease, hunger, the up-rooted, economic hardships, women and child suffering, and all forms of abusive systems as causes of sorrow on the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Salvation Army church minister paid glowing tribute to celebrated Catholic nun-Mother Teresa of Calcutta, India, for her excellent work and concern among the poor in India. &quot;She has become a household name through human contact,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he challenged fellow African Christians; &quot;Let us become Christians that are involved totally. Let's wash the wounds, bandage them and care to prove that we love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his brief address to delegates, ACLCA president, South African church minister, Rev. Sipho Masemola challenged churches and Christians in general to journey together with ACLCA for greater participation in the future, even as they joined the organization during its Silver Jubilee celebrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instituted in 1970, the ACLCA which currently enjoys a membership of 67 lay Christian training centres in 24 African countries, is a fellowship of African lay centres, academies and movements of social concern, whose common mission is leadership training, laity formation and ecumenical learning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The centres which associate themselves in this fellowship seek to share ideas and adopt common strategies for action, to fulfill together their common vision to the glory of one Father, Son and Holy Spirit,&quot; remarked the association's Executive Secretary, Rev. Jonah Katoneene, in an interview with APS during the Silver Jubilee celebrations in the Zimbabwean capital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANTANANARIVO (APS) OCTOBER 14 - At least 17 candidates, including two former presidents, will be vying for the top posts during the coming Malagasy presidential elections scheduled for November 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading the field will be two former presidents, the recently impeached former president Albert Zafy and the man he defeated in the last poll in February 1993, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, the current acting President Norbert Ratsirahonana, and the outgoing national assembly president Pastor Richard Andriamanjato, a past chairman of the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also standing is former prime minister Guy Razanamasy and opposition politician Herizo Razafimahaleo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list was compiled by the Indian Ocean island republic's election officials at the deadline for handing over nomination papers on October 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malagasies will vote for a new head of state on November 3, following the destitution of president Albert Zafy by the high constitutional court of Madagascar, officials said here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The October 5 deadline date was set by the government of the large Indian Ocean island republic, where Ratsirahonana was named interim president by the country's constitutional court on September 5, after upholding a decision by the general assembly taken in July to impeach Zafy, whom parliamentarians accused of failing to enact plans to form a senate, or upper house of parliament, and to reform the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elected three years ago with a large majority, Zafy had been bracing himself for the court's ruling after the vote at the end of July, in which 99 of the 138 members of the lower house of parliament wanted him impeached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once elected to a presidency with diminished powers, Zafy had pledged to be the guardian of the new constitution of Madagascar's Third Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emmanuel Rakotovahiny resigned as prime minister in May after his government received a no-confidence vote in the national assembly, but his replacement by the president of the constitutional court, Norbert Ratsirahonana, failed to dispel the government's unpopularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zafy, a former professor of medicine and health minister, was a key figure in the pro-democracy movement that eventually ended the 17- year rule of former military strongman, Didier Ratsiraka.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (APS) OCTOBER 14 - Despite its stated commitment to return Nigeria to civilian rule by October 1, 1998, the Nigerian government continues to violate the rights of Nigerian citizens to freely engage in political activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Permanent Transition, a report released on September 26 by Human Rights Watch/Africa, assesses the transition programme and the steps that have been taken toward its implementation to date, including an examination of the seriously flawed local government elections of March 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 52-page report identifies the impediments to free political activity that destroy the credibility of the transition programme, including the detention and imprisonment of opposition politicians, human rights and pro- democracy activists, trade unionists and journalists, as well as restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly, association and movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press release here, Human Rights Watch charges that recent reforms announced by the government including the restoration of a right to appeal in some cases where it had been denied, the repeal of a decree preventing the courts from granting writs of habeas corpus in favour of detainees held without charge, and the creation of a human rights commission are purely cosmetic, and do not begin to address the need for fundamental reform and renewal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Human Rights Watch calls for the imposition of additional international sanctions including freezing the foreign assets of members of the Nigerian military government to ensure that the West African nation is returned to civilian rule by a freely elected government as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repression continues in Ogoniland, birthplace of executed minority rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa. Nineteen Ogonis still await trial before the same Civil Disturbances Special Tribunal that convicted Saro-Wiwa and eight others and sentenced them to death in October 1995, executions later described by British Prime Minister John Major as &quot;judicial murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other suspected sympathizers of Saro-Wiwa's organization, the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), were detained after demonstrations on January 4, 1996, celebrated as &quot;Ogoni Day&quot; since January 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still more Ogonis were detained before or during the April visit of a fact- finding team sent to Nigeria by the United Nations Secretary General, despite assurances by the Nigerian government that nobody would be penalized for attempting to speak to the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Nigerian government has put in place token efforts at &quot; reconciliation&quot; in Ogoniland, it has not made any move to pay compensation to the families of the executed activists, as recommended by the UN fact-finding team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International attention has shifted from Nigeria during 1996, after an outcry following the November 1995 executions of the Ogoni Nine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although sanctions imposed following the executions remain in force, as well as those put in place in 1993, no further measures have been imposed, despite the lack of genuine progress in returning the country to an elected government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commonwealth, which suspended Nigeria's membership in November 1995, has halted the implementation of additional sanctions recommended in April 1996 by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), pending further discussions with the Nigerian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Organization of African Unity (OAU) has failed to take any measures against Nigeria, and the African Commission on Human and People's Rights, which held an extraordinary session on Nigeria in December 1995, has yet to follow this up with further action or recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch calls for international pressure to be maintained and intensified to ensure that the Nigerian government takes meaningful steps to improve the human rights situation. Detainees must be released and free expression and assembly restored in order to ensure a genuine transition to civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, Human Rights Watch urges the imposition of a total arms embargo on Nigeria, and the freezing of assets held in other countries by members of the Nigerian armed forces or senior members of the government and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch was also concerned that the CMAG which met on September 28 to 29, would urge the Commonwealth member states to implement the sanctions recommended last April, and also adopt an asset freeze and arms embargo.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAMAKO (APS) OCTOBER 14 - The West African nation of Mali, one of the poorest countries in the world, has become the first in Africa to confirm it will commit troops to the proposed Africa Crisis Response Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malian President Alpha Oumar Konare, told visiting American Secretary of State Warren Christopher here on October 8 that Mali was ready to participate in the Crisis Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Christopher was in Bamako on the first leg of a five-nation tour of Africa, the first time he has visited sub-Saharan Africa. Christopher commended Mali for its contribution of troops during the Gulf War crisis in the early 90's.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many years the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has been trying to organize such a force to intervene in conflicts or natural disasters on the continent but was unable to win donor support or commitment to fund it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in the face of crises in Burundi, Liberia and the potentially explosive situation in eastern Zaire, the United States said it would contribute a substantial portion of the estimated $40 million required to train and equip the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States State Department Under Secretary for African Affairs George Moose said the primary purpose of the crisis intervention force was to impose peace on warring factions. Moose believes such a force could be created quickly and deployed as a preventive force or in explosive locations like Burundi in the event of a Rwanda-style genocide scenario becoming a reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary of State told his hosts in Bamako that he will consolidate the idea of the Crisis Force in Ethiopia - his second stop over in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Addis Ababa he will meet officials of the OAU before travelling to Tanzania where his arrival on October 11, will coincide with the Eastern Africa regional meeting to review the situation in the troubled Central African nation of Burundi. Christopher will then travel to South Africa and Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bamako, Christopher, who has been accused of neglecting Africa since he took office in 1992, choosing instead to concentrate on the Arab-Israel conflict, was met by jubilant dancers and found time to tour a number of American supported projects run by the 160-strong peace corps in the West African nation. He pledged $700,000 to Malis' General Election due next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He suggested that African nations should search quickly for a candidate to take over the post of United Nations Secretary General since America would not support the incumbent Boutros Boutros-Ghali whose term expires later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher said America had made up its mind that Boutros Ghali must relinquish his post, charging that the Egyptian born Secretary General had failed to deliver over the last five years that he has been head of the cash- strapped UN. Ironically the United States is the UN's biggest debtor nation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA (APS) OCTOBER 14 - A meeting convened by the Uganda Women's Network resolved on October 7 to form a pressure or lobby group to work for a peaceful resolution to the insurgency in the North of the country, particularly West Nile, Gulu and Kitgum districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stormy meeting comes in the wake of reports that the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) led by a one time Catholic catechist, Joseph Kony, had murdered 70 people in Gulu and Kitgum districts in the month of September alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting by the Uganda Women Network (UWONET) which combines all national non-governmental women's organizations, criticised the government of Uganda for its failure to involve women from the onset in making decisions about the war in the North.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women said they will hold &quot;highly publicized&quot; demonstrations demanding peace as a way of putting pressure on both government and rebels to end the suffering of the people in northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UWONET meeting was chaired by Ms. Rebecca Kadaga, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in charge of Regional Affairs. It was attended by politicians, diplomats and people from the affected districts in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The keynote address was delivered by Ms. Winnie Byanyima, a Member of Parliament from south-western Uganda, who said the war was fanned by selfish individuals both on the government side as well as Acholi tribes people from the north &quot;who are using ethnicity to pursue their narrow agenda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of us politicians in Uganda are guilty of tribalising the war in the North to pursue our own personal agenda,&quot; she lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the origins of the northern conflict was economic imbalance in Uganda created in the period of colonial rule, when the colonial administration formulated stereotype roles for Uganda's various tribalcommunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current insurgency in the North began in 1986 when President Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Movement/Army (NRM/A)came to power. Soldiers of the defeated former regime combined with the &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; movement of the mystic Alice Lakwena had returned from Sudan to wage war on the new regime.  She was defeated in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, Joseph Kony a former catechist of the Catholic church formed a splinter fighting group called the Lord's Resistance Army which initially sought to have Uganda ran as a fundamentalist Christian state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (APS) OCTOBER 14 - The genocide trial of Ethiopia's former dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam and his aides resumed in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa on October 1, with the arraigning in court of 46 defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 120 people, all former soldiers, including Lieutenant- Colonel Mengistu himself, face charges of genocide and crimes against humanity under his Marxist regime between 1974 and 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the first day of the hearings on October 1, which lasted only two hours, witnesses told how family members disappeared under the &quot;Red Terror&quot; regime of Mengistu, with the 40th witness in the trial taking the stand and describing how his younger brother, a student, Malo Salai, was arrested in 1976 and was never seen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His classmates were arrested because they distributed opposition tracts. I wanted to protect him by forbidding him from leaving the house, but he managed to get out. You know how young people are,&quot; said the witness, a retired colonel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family finally learnt that the youth was in the central prison. Police later gave them back his clothes and simply said that he was no longer in jail. &quot;After that, we mourned him. We don't know how he was killed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other witnesses described how they lost relatives in similar circumstances. One woman's husband was arrested while she was in hospital.  When she was discharged, she found that prison authorities had given back his jersey and a towel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 8, six other witnesses took the stand and told of atrocities committed by Mengistu's Marxist military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One witness took off his jacket and shirt and showed the court a long scar which he said came from a wound caused by three bullets the day soldiers killed his mother and arrested his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His sister, today an elected local government official, also gave evidence before the court, where 46 of the accused were present in the dock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police officer said he had been ordered to escort prisoners to the central jail, which was known as &quot;Alem Bekagn&quot; (The world is over), and disclosed that some of them never got there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mengistu, who is in exile in Zimbabwe, and 24 other defendants are being tried in their absence, while others among the accused are dead, either eliminated during purges of the junta or killed trying to flee the country when allied rebel armies toppled his regime in May 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial, known as &quot;Africa's Nuremberg&quot;, began in December 1994 and has been held up by procedural questions and adjournments, the last of them in July, to allow for holidays and the rainy season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indictments, totalling almost 500 pages, accuse members of the regime known as the Derg, of the murder of 1,825 people, torturing about 100 others and other crimes against humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In previous hearings, 39 women related to the victims of mass murder gave evidence, together with former soldiers and the chamberlains of the late emperor Haile Selassie, who was suffocated in his bed at the age of 83 with an ether-soaked pillow in 1975, the year after Mengistu seized power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accused face the death sentence on conviction. Three of those being tried in their absence are holed up in the Italian embassy here and Rome is reluctant to extradite them because they face capital punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others accused of war crimes, forcibly displacing whole populations and other acts while serving the junta are due to be tried by other courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A document released by special prosecutor Guirma Wakjira's office in August 1994, indicates that 1,315 suspected of taking part in massacres are in prison, but other sources say the total number of detainees is closer to 2, 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights groups and opponents of the government headed by Meles Zenawi, former leader of the Tigre People's Liberation Front (TPLF) rebels who were allied with Eritrean forces, have accused it of violating the rights of the defendants by holding them for more than four years awaiting trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the government maintains that the legal system and the financial resources at the disposal of the prosecution have made it impossible to move any faster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's case has been helped by the bureaucratic practices of Mengistu's brand of Marxism, which produced 300,000 pages of incriminating documents as well as films and videos. Estimates of the number of killings under Mengistu range from 50,000 to 200,000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) OCTOBER 14 - A journalism programme here recently organized a workshop to discuss the role of media in conflict prevention and resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eighth in a series, the seminar which was facilitated by the United States International University - African (USIU-A) ran from September 25 to 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme which began on February 1995 has trained more than 200 practitioners in various fields of specialization including the coverage of elections, feature writing, gender issues, interpretative reporting and investigative journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the latest seminar, participants observed that conflicts worldwide, in Africa or Kenya, will always be a source of news and good copy for journalists everywhere, but whenever journalists write about conflicts they probably make situations worse than they already are.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wars, bloodshed and death are the very substance which dominate front pages and news bulletins in both print and electronic media the world over, the meeting noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conflicts make an important part of human interest stories, they will continue to dominate both space and time in all the news media, participants agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a stimulated contribution Mr. Joe Kadhi, former managing editor of Kenya's leading mass circulation daily, the Daily Nation, who is currently the journalism programme coordinator at the USIU-A, challenged journalists to become more involved in efforts to ensure that Kenya will never degenerate into a state of bloody civil war similar to what has been experienced elsewhere in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to bloodshed during the 1991-93 political/ethnic land clashes in parts of the country, Mr Kadhi underscored the need for journalists to be exposed to professional ethics of covering conflicts and peace efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The role played by media in stirring up ill feelings among people can clearly be seen in Rwanda, where radio effectively built up hatred among nationals of the same country, although from different ethnic background, Mr.  Kadhi emphasized</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying journalists could be agents of peace and understanding, the USIU-A journalism programme coordinator called for deliberate efforts to make media practitioners change the style, language and presentation of ethnic clashes, with a view to highlighting positive and responsible journalism without hiding any facts or muzzling the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Polycarp Ochilo, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi School of Journalism, who is also a communication consultant at the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) Communication Training Centre (CTC), challenged the media to seek the root causes of conflict as a way of finding solutions and promoting peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AACC communication consultant also called for research activities in areas where conflicts exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media , he said, should encourage social and cultural promotion of dialogue where conflicts arise and construct an international order to promote democracy. &quot;You cannot solve the conflict if you don't understand the value of the conflict,&quot; added Ochilo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on the Western misconception about Africa, a veteran cameraman Mohammed Amin said the Western world is assumed to be unprepared to relish any story from the rest of the world, especially from the Third World, unless such a story is &quot;juicy&quot; because of its negative highlights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cameraman cited famines, volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, political upheavals as some of the disasters with which the Western world and media identify Africa and Third World in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editors and &quot;gatekeepers&quot; in the Western newsrooms are usually men and women who have never &quot;left their editorial armchairs&quot; to see for themselves at firsthand - the real situation in Africa, so as to be able to give a correct and more sympathetic account of why Africa is besieged by such calamities, noted Mr. Amin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seminar, jointly conducted by a team of professional experts and academicians who have either worked as journalists in high ranking positions or have taught journalism for a long time, brought together more than 50 participants drawn from local newspapers and other media in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants called for an independent information body which would be responsible for African news only.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - For the past four or so years, Ochieng' Okelo has been earning an honest, if a little too energy-sapping, livelihood as a bicycle taxi operator in Kisumu, Kenya's third largest town with a population of about 300,000, and situated about 500 kilometres west of the capital, Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although rather menial-looking and probably looked down upon, Okelo's occupation has improved his life from below the poverty line to reasonably comfortable levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not any more. For the life line of Ochieng' Okelo, 38, and his 1,000 colleagues in the Lake Victoria port town, is threatened by forces beyond their control. &quot;I don't know what I will do should this business collapse,&quot; lamented Okelo during an interview with APS.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first place, a controversy has been stirred by bicycle operators in Busia District, about 140 kilometres north-west of Kisumu, where the pedal- powered vehicles are called boda-boda, an onomatopoeic term referring to the area of operation--across the Kenya-Uganda border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here the bikemen ferry small-scale traders from the Busia border town to various destinations in the district and its environs. According to recent press reports, the spouses of the men who ride these bicycles are complaining rather loudly that their partners do not perform their husbandly duties to their wives' satisfaction after a day's hard slogging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When he comes home in the evening, my man is so tired that my conjugal rights are not met,&quot; the local press quoted one woman as griping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But health experts disagree with the women, arguing that bicycle riding does not cause impotence. Says Dr. John Owiyo, a Kisumu- based physician: &quot; Riding a bicycle for long hours per se does not reduce a man's libido, or his sexual performance. The effect is merely physical and psychological. The women should know better and feed their men properly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Opondo Wakhungu, a clinical psychologist argues that the economic pressures, especially on the men, are not conducive to good sexual performance. Like all the other men in the business and the salaried sectors, he says, the pressure to work harder and meet the family's cash obligations reduces the man's libido. &quot;The bikemen, by virtue of their very energy- sapping calling, bear the brunt of this inadequacy more than many other cadres of men,&quot; Dr. Wakhungu says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This complaint by the Busia women in general has spread to Kisumu town and its environs where the pedal-powered bike has become a popular mode of commuter transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several sleepless nights caused by quarrels from a neighbour's house, this writer accosted the man of the house who summarised his situation thus: &quot; It is not my fault, it is my wife's. She keeps moaning about my inability to do this and that, and sometimes this altercation ends up in a fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are a fellow man, I may confide in you. This woman says that since I started operating my bike taxi, my sexual performance has not been up to the required standards. She says that the situation is going from bad to worse,&quot; the neighbour who is also a bicycle taxi operator told this writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His 35 year-old wife had this to say: &quot;In matters of marriage and procreation I cannot be shy,&quot; she bellowed. &quot;You see, Baba Toto, (father of children) I took quite sometime having children and I have only three to show for my age. When this man comes home he's so tired he's no good to any woman.  If this situation continues, I may not be able to have any more children while my co-wife has eight. Much as I need the money, I am entitled to my conjugal rights and to children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another raw point in the bikemen's business is how to keep their customers satisfied. Says Ochieng' Okelo: &quot;My customers keep complaining about either the hot sun or the rain. At such times my earnings are drastically reduced as the would-be customers are forced to travel by other means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Kisumu bicycle taxi operators are organising themselves into a co-operative society, with a view to fixing hoods on their bikes, like the rickshaws of India, this may take quite a bit of time, subjecting their business to further problems beyond their individual control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evolution of the biycle as an alternative means of commuter transport in Kisumu town may be ascribed to the town's general level of poverty. The ramshackle saloon cars that ply the town's routes are few and far between, and the Government-owned Nyayo Bus Corporation which used to ease the situation somewhat, has gone under and is in the process of being sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private cars are even fewer and mostly owned by the more affluent Asian community who continue to dominate the town's business life. Although the Luo, who dominate the town blame this state of affairs on state marginalisation, they bear part of the blame owing to their combative politics and inconsolable opposition to the establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, in answer to the residents' call for a cheaper and more readily available means of commuter transport, came the bicycle taxis which have proved very popular, especially with the low-income workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bikemen charge an average of shillings 10 (less than 20 US cents) per trip covering distances between the town centre and the suburbs. And since an ambitious operator can make up to 30 trips a day, a monthly earning of Sh.9, 000 (about $160) is not out of question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, although the hike-on-a-bike business is greatly threatened, it remains a lucrative means of livelihood for many Kisumu residents who cannot make good elsewhere. Besides, the many commuters who cannot afford the exorbitant fares charged by matatus (communal taxis) and buses, will continue to depend on it and take sides with the men operators, even when the debate touches on that crucial male factor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - According to political activists, Algerian President Liamine Zeroual has embarked on an apparent race to undermine hardline Islamic movements in Algeria by making Islam the official language in this north African country, while at the same time pushing through with democratic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an announcement made in the Algerian capital, Algiers, on October 14, Zeroual said he would put the issue of religion to a referendum on November 28, a move that was clearly aimed at preventing the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) from gaining ground and reclaiming its position as a major political power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zeroual, who embarked on a week-long tour of Gulf and Asian countries on October 15, has also been trying to bring various political parties into talks aimed at convincing them of his willingness to implement democratic changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed amendment has, however, stopped short of making a unilateral declaration on the vexing issue of separation of church from state, as has been demanded by several democratic and secular parties, such as the former communist Ettahaddi Movement, although stressing that &quot;Islam is our religion and our foundation since the message was delivered&quot; by the prophet Mohamed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his address to the nation, Zeroual called on Algerians to decide on the issue of religion and state, while taking into account that Islam, Arab and Berber were the three main components of national identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His proposed constitutional reforms, however, do not deal with the issue of Berber becoming the official language along with Arabic, as called for by various Berber parties and opposition groups who have threatened to boycott the referendum vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told voters in his televised speech that his proposed reforms would ensure that Islam and the Berber language would no longer be used as political weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are being asked to decide on what criteria should be used for the creation (of parties) that will operate without being manipulated by religious and language&quot; issues, he said, adding that such parties would have to avoid being influenced by foreign powers and refrain from violence, a reference to the armed campaign by Islamic fundamentalists to topple the government since January 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence has left tens of thousand of people dead and severely crippled the country's economic and political standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zeroual said that his government was doing all it could to eliminate terrorism in the country and that his decision to be lenient with &quot;lost&quot; citizens had allowed us &quot;to save numerous of our youngsters&quot; who had joined armed groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amendments to the constitution will also be designed to limit the powers of the president in favour of parliament, which will be given a second chamber to &quot;give more stability to the institutions of the state,&quot; Zeroual said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zeroual said the referendum would also cover the creation of a council of state to &quot;strengthen justice and administration,&quot; and the introduction of a state high court which would be given powers to try the president &quot;should he no longer be worthy of the confidence placed in him by the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am committing myself, today, before you, to respect your sovereign decision. Your choice will be the substance of a move towards the revision of laws on the parties and on the electoral code, as well as legislative and local elections,&quot; Zeroual said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President also confirmed that general elections would be held before mid-next year, and local elections before the end of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Algerian Head of State last month announced the establishment of a national commission, to be chaired by Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, to organise the referendum in the strife-torn country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 700,000 Algerians living abroad will also be entitled to vote. Algeria has been in the throes of a savage civil war since 1992, pitting the military- backed government against Islamic fundamentalist insurgents who claim to have won parliamentary elections in January of that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government annulled the elections, sparking a conflict which has so far cost an estimated 50,000 lives. The new developments come in the wake of an escalation of bloody attacks by the Islamic extremists throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 11, a 25-strong gang of armed Islamic extremists burned down a professional training centre for some 300 young women in western Algiers after overpowering guards, the daily El Watan newspaper reported on October 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the attackers stayed in the building in the Bainem quarter of the capital for an hour to make sure it had caught fire, before fleeing into a nearby wood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, 815 schools and 34 training centres were hit in attacks blamed on Islamic extremists fighting the Algerian government. The armed fundamentalists consider aspects of education to be un- Islamic. Teachers and pupils have been murdered in the country's bitter conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the October 11 attack on the professional training centre, two more bombs have rocked Algeria, killing seven people and injuring a further 26 in the town of Blida, 50 kilometres south of Algiers, and bringing the death toll since the beginning of September to over 80, according to press reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first bomb on October 16, which ripped through a passing train, killing three and wounding 10 more, had been placed on a railway line outside the town, the daily Liberte said on October 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second blast occurred on the afternoon of October 17 in a working class district of the town, leaving four dead and 16 injured, according Liberte.  Both bombings were attributed to the Islamic fundamentalists' bloody campaign of violence aimed at destabilising Algeria's military-backed government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of the worst incidents recently, a car bomb which exploded in a crowded market place in nearby Boufarik killed 27 and left more than 80 injured on September 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty eight people were on October 8 slaughtered at a false checkpoint near a gas field in the south of the country, while on October 15, the Islamic extremists killed four people and injured 13 others in two separate incidents, security services said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said three people were killed overnight and 13 injured, two of them seriously, when a homemade bomb exploded in the Lakhdaria district south-east of the capital, while the fourth person killed was the business manager of the Arabic language weekly Echuruk who was shot while driving his car in the capital early the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security services communique said Hamoui Mokrane, 43, was gunned down by a &quot;group of terrorists&quot;, the official term used for armed Islamic extremists. The Echuruk magazine has one of the biggest circulations in the Algerian press and is usually aimed at female readership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists became prime targets in 1993, and 54 have since been killed as well as another 20 or so people working as drivers or in other press-related jobs, whom the fundamentalists accused of &quot;collaborating&quot; with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal attack on the manager was the third on an Echuruk employee. In May last year, journalist Malika Sabour, 22, had her throat cut by an armed gang, while in November, Khadidja Dahmani, 28, was shot dead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Voicing their concern in a recently published book, &quot;Violence Against Women,&quot; a group of Kenyan women theologians blame the violence against their lot squarely on the church as an institution as well as on cultural values, which they say demean the African womanhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And because of the diversity of the subject matter, the ten women theologians have dealt with the rather controversial issue under ten papers which include among others, Feminist Theology and African Culture; Rape as a Tool of Violence against Women; Theological Reflection on Economic Violence against Women; The Church in Africa and Violence against Women and the Status of Women in African Naming Systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their introductory remarks, Grace Wamue and Mary Getui who edited the 85- page volume say; &quot;The violence is many faceted -- cultural, social, religious and economic. Each of the voices in this book is crying out to society and to the church for recognition, attention and action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, say the editors, women are wondering why the church, the body of Christ does not seem to curb, address or even realise that women are getting a raw deal. The theme that runs through all the papers is that violence against women is not warranted and should be eliminated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her paper, Feminist Theology and African Culture, Dr. Musimbi Kanyoro appreciates the efforts taken by fellow women to speak out, saying; &quot;If today African women are able to name the oppressive aspects of our cultures, it has not come easily. For centuries, African women have gone so far along with cultural prescriptions, that we came to believe that our lives were to be managed by commands of our cultures. The fear of breaking taboos silenced us into a state where we act without questioning what we do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kanyoro, currently Secretary for Women in Church and Society in the department of Mission and Development of the Geneva-based Lutheran World Federation (LWF), describes the study of theology from the women's perspective as a gift to the church and to women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says the study of theology has opened the eyes of many women to the gospel of Jesus Christ the Redeemer, and goes on to refer to women's theological reflections as an oasis in a desert, a pearl of great price, a treasure long hidden and just discovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A strong believer in feminist theology, Dr. Kanyoro explains that feminist theology springs out of women's experiences in church and society. It gives women an imperative call to remember and to name their experiences by articulating their stories of faith and life. By telling their day to day stories, the church will be forced to listen to their day to day struggles and the way in which women have maintained their faith in God, says the Kenyan theologian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the composition of its members and leadership Dr. Kanyoro observes: &quot;The church will need to come to grips with the fact that 80 per cent of the church membership in Africa is made up of women and not even 5 per cent of the leadership of the church is women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cautioning that women's stories should not be told as individual stories of endless suffering, the Kenyan theologian proposes that these &quot;must be told collectively as corporate stories of a community of God's people moving forward in faith and hope in order to bring renewal to the Church of Christ.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing on Violence Against Women in African Oral Literature as portrayed in proverbs, Hazel Ayanga says cases of violence against women include rape or attempted rape, physical assault like battering and sometimes actual murder and killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But violence against women seems to have some deep rooted causes, she points out. In other words, she elaborates that causes of general violence in society are not adequate explanations for violence against women. There appears to be some religious cultural roots of violence against African women, she observes, adding; &quot;the place of women in traditional and to a large extent in modern African societies is determined by cultural norms and attitudes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These norms and values have been passed on orally. They have been preserved and propagated from generation to generation through different forms of the spoken word -- mainly stories, proverbs, songs, myths and rituals, Ayanga explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenyan scholar recommends that the negative and prejudicial proverbs should be discarded as new evidence and new challenges are identified and addressed. There may be a need of continued reformation of proverbs if they are to remain current and useful in the society. In this way, &quot;we can identify with and put in practice Christ's parable, 'And no one pours the new wine into old wineskin. If he does, the wineskin will be ruined,&quot; (Luke 5:37: 38) she stresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the subject Theological Reflection on Economic Violence Against Women, Constance Shisanya, suggests that Kenyan women should put pressure on the government to punish all those individuals who misuse child labour and force young girls into early marriages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And hopefully, she says, this would provide girls with equal education opportunities to compete with boys, thereby eliminating the existing gender disparities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shisanya adds, however, she would be acting on faith by attempting to enforce the suggested proposals on the Christian Community. The effort, she explains, would be in line with the biblical teaching on caring for the under privileged in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Church in Africa and Violence Against Women Ruth Muthei James, revisits the controversial subject of ordination of women into priesthood.  With regard to theological education, she suggests that all churches open up ordained ministry for women. Church leaders should encourage and be supportive to young women who desire to be trained as ordained ministers and theologians, she recommends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She challenges women to stand up and tell church authorities boldly that they are discriminated against, while stressing the need for churches to re- evaluate their practices with the aim to remove negative cultural influences that are oppressive to women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Rape as a Tool of Violence Against Women, Margaret Gecaga says the church should play the role of condemning all violations of human dignity and personal rights and help rehabilitate the victims of sexual abuse and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the community level, the local churches should alert their communities about manifestations of violence including rape, marital violence, child abuse, domination and submission of women and images of women as sex objects in the media, she suggests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And basing her argument on several biblical verses to show the dignity of women from God's point of view, Gecaga says sexual violence tends to be seen in isolation as the act of a few perverted sex monsters. &quot;But we have to see its connection with more widespread male behaviour towards women,&quot; she stresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In political conflicts, rape is committed by the victorious troops against women of the defeated side or considered as an act of aggression during the progress of the fighting, she further says, adding, &quot;this was the case in Bosnia, where Muslim women were raped by government soldiers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Nguiko: A Tempering of Sexual Assault Against Women, Dr. Hannah Kinoti, laments that the early Christian missionaries among the Kikuyu community held the general outlook of the 19th century missionaries that &quot;everything in non- Christian religions and cultures was evil. It was an outlook, which particularly denied any culture of value in Africa. In their perceived double mission to evangelise and civilize the African, missionaries believed that it was their duty to overhaul African culture,&quot; she argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grace Wamue in her paper, Gender Violence and Exploitation: The Widow's Dilemma says the general view of widowhood in Kenya today, portrays negative stereotyping and stigmatization. She defines the attitude towards widowhood as an abuse of human dignity which perpetuates further psychological violence to a person who is grieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wamue further describes a widow's dilemma as a form of sexist oppression because, a widower seems protected by the society from any stereotype and social stigma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lengthy burial preparations and complications, financial and property disposition, all turn a widow into a pauper, says Wamue. She recommends that theologians should tell the church when it goes wrong and educate widows on their rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on the Status of Women in African Naming Systems, Dr. Mary Getui argues that the woman's role and place in the naming of her child should be appreciated. As it is now, she explains, the woman goes through a lot of physical, emotional and psychological trauma, which, she adds, affects her well-being and sometimes that of the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She recommends that women should not allow themselves to be pushed too far.  They should be alert and ready to combat any attempts that may be made to violate them because of names and naming, and anything else for that matter, she further recommends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her presentation Hannah, Why Do You Weep?: (1 Samuel and 2:1-21), Dr.  Nyambura Njoroge says while quoting the biblical words, &quot;Hannah's words to Eli, the priest, could be or have been uttered by many African women in her situation. No. my Lord, I am a woman deeply troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the Lord.  Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation all this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Hannah, women are capable of making decisions, acting and encountering God without a male intermediary because, like men, they are endowed with many gifts by the Holy Spirit and are empowered by the grace of God to participate fully in God's household, says Njoroge, the executive secretary, Department of Women and Men in Partnership at the Geneva-based World Alliance of Reformed Churches (WARC).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE (APS) October 25 - Christians in Zimbabwe are set to raise Zimbabwe dollars 4 million (US$400,000) towards the 8th General Assembly of the World Council of Churches (WCC), which this Southern African country will host from September 10 to 21, 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the assembly's local coordinator, Rosemary Siyachitema, the WCC Geneva secretariat will contribute Z$6 million (US$600,000) towards the assembly budget bringing the estimated total expenditure to Z$10 million (US$ one million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with APS here on October 10, Siyachitema said the money will be raised mainly from the 20 member churches of the Zimbabwe Council of Churches, the host organization for the assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea here is to mobilise each and every Christian in the country to help raise the targeted amount, but with special emphasis on the ZCC member churches,&quot; she explained.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On preparations already underway, Siyachitema informed that they had already instituted a local secretariat and set up operational, theological school, liaison, fund-raising and policy-making committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More committees are yet to be set up to cover such areas as communication (media) and accomodation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assembly, to be held at the University of Zimbabwe, will bring together between 3,000 to 4,000 delegates representing the 330 WCC member churches in more than 100 countries all over the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 8th assembly which will also coincide with WCC's 50th anniversary, will deliberate on the theme, Turn to God-Rejoice in Hope, derived from the Book of Leviticus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siyachitema, told APS of the organising committees' commitment to sell the name of the assembly to the local churches and Christians, in the hope that most of the activities will have taken shape in 1997, a year before the assembly is held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Murombedzi Chikanga Kuchera, the ZCC General Secretary, described Zimbabwe's hosting of the assembly as a great honour accorded to the church in Africa and particularly to this Southern African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a challenge we would like to face squarely. We expect the entire church in Africa and more so the church here to join us in this venture,&quot; he told APS in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to comment on the debate of homosexuals in the church, a controversial subject that has featured in previous WCC decision making fora such as the Central Committee, Siyachitema referred to WCC General Secretary Konrad Raiser's visit to Zimbabwe last August, and his talks with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe over the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an earlier story carried in the APS Bulletin (See APS No.39/96) Dr.  Raiser was reported assuring the WCC Central Committee members meeting in Geneva from September 12 to 20, that President Mugabe promised to protect the participants at the WCC assembly, allowing them freedom of association and expression of opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate on homosexuality has become particularly sensitive within the WCC in view of Harare as the venue for the 8th Assembly, because of President Mugabe's publicly declared distaste of homosexuals whom he has likened to &quot; beasts&quot;, threatening to jail them. On the other hand, WCC's 330 member churches meeting in Harare in 1998 have widely differing views on homosexuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a WCC president, Rev. Dr. Eunice Santana, who was attending the General Assembly of the Association of Christian Lay Centres in Africa (ACLCA) held here from October 6 to 13, had this to say of the continent playing host to the WCC event; &quot;The fact that Africa will host yet another WCC assembly (the 5th WCC assembly took place in Nairobi in 1975) is an indication that the African church is still within the heart beat of the WCC. We should therefore pray hard that things go as scheduled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She singled out the forthcoming assembly as special, in that it will mark the end of the WCC-sponsored Ecumenical Decade in Solidarity with Women (1989- 1998).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highest governing body of the World Council of Churches, the Assembly meets approximately every seven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the first at inauguration in Amsterdam, Netherlands in 1948, other assemblies have taken place as follows; Evanson, United States of America (1954); New Delhi, India (1961); Uppsala, Sweden (1968); Nairobi, Kenya (1975) ; Vancouver, Canada (1983) and Canberra, Australia in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WCC staff is currently headed by General Secretary Konrad Raiser, from the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raiser, reappointed by the last (September 12 to 20) WCC central committee to a second five-year term of office, was elected to his present position by the 1992 central committee, and took up his duties in Geneva in January 1993.  His first term of office expires at the end of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His reappointment on September 18 means the German theologian will hold office until the end of the year 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, WCC faces major challenges including financial difficulties which call for reorganization and re-thinking of the role of the ecumenical body.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON DC (APS) October 25 - The United States Drug Enforcement Agency has claimed a major victory following the smashing last September of a major international drug smuggling ring led by Nigerian women. Of the 34 people arrested worldwide 15 are women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drug enforcement agents said some 55 tonnes of heroin worth $25 million was seized worldwide. &quot;Their operations were on such a scale they rivalled that of the Colombian Medelin drug barons,&quot; observed Jim Milford, head of the Drug Enforcement Agency here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milford said the head of the syndicate was a Nigerian woman based in the city of Chicago, United States. She used her boutique business in Chicago as the nerve centre in a global smuggling operation that relied on an elaborate exercise in deception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One strategy the smuggling ring used all the time was to constantly vary their routes in order to confuse anti-narcotics officials in Asia, Europe and America. One of the seven main routes traced from Bangkok, Thailand to Europe, California, Mexico and then into Texas for onward distribution through the mid-western states of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chicago Tribune reported early October that the anti-narcotics officials made their first break through against the syndicate more than a year ago when their officials learnt about the Nigerian's boutique in Chicago.  Quietly they pieced together intelligence reports over a period of one year before moving in to arrest the culprits. Telephone conversations conducted in Nigerian ethnic language were taped and translated to obtain vital leads that helped police to crack the syndicate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Milford praised police and drug enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Mexico, New York, Thailand and Singapore for the coordinated surveillance that made the arrests possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers fear that the involvement of African women as key players in the drug syndicate's operations will heighten the survailance of African women travellers particularly those on business trips to Far Eastern countries like Thailand, and Singapore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, Nigerian women comprise a large proportion of female prisoners in British penal institution. Most of these women were on drug courier missions when they were arrested.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA (APS) October 25 - The head of the Catholic church in Uganda, Emmanuel Cardinal Wamala spent three days in war-torn Gulu district of northern Uganda, in what was described as a &quot;pastoral visit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Cardinal went on a pastoral visit mainly to address seminarians at Alokolum Seminary,&quot; a statement from the Archbishop's office in Lubaga, Kampala, said of the October 21 to 23 visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seminarians at Alokolum were recently reported to have demanded weapons training for self protection after the abduction of more than 100 girls by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels who are fighting the regime of President Yoweri Museveni. Coincidentally President Museveni is in Gulu on an indefinite stay.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cardinal Wamala and the Catholic Bishops of Uganda have consistently advocated peace talks between the government and the LRA rebels who the government says are armed by neighbouring Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three months ago, the Episcopal Conference of Uganda sent a three- man delegation led by Bishop Kalanda of Fort Portal to sound out prospects for a peace initiative. However, unconfirmed reports claimed that Joseph Kony, the leader of the LRA said he would await a &quot;signal from God&quot; before entering into any negotiations with President Museveni's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Cardinal was in Gulu, the Parliamentary Select Committee on the rebellion in the North was also in Gulu and took evidence from all interested parties on how to end the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among witnesses was the Bishop of Gulu Catholic Diocese, Martin Luluga, who called on the government to extend a blanket amnesty to rebel leader Joseph Kony and his commanders like Colonel Otti Lagony and Oti Vincent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Museveni says Kony and his commanders are war criminals but Bishop Luluga and scores of other witnesses insisted that the only way to end the rebellion is to pardon the rebels and their leaders without any pre- conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Museveni should swallow his pride and talk to Kony and others elsewhere, said Rev. George Odwong, a former military chaplain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a former state minister in charge of the North Mrs. Betty Bigombe who is now at Harvard University, characterised the select parliamentary probe committee on the rebellion in the North &quot;as a waste of money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the committee had only availed rebel sympathisers a platform to attack the government. Mrs. Bigombe warned that Joseph Kony's rebels are now confident they have strong backing from Sudan, &quot;they see no reason to enter into negotiations with the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the London-based Amnesty International has accused the Lord's Resistance Army of massive abuses of human rights, particularly rape and deliberate killings of civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its 1996 report, Amnesty says in April 1996 alone, as many as 200 civilians in the North were deliberately killed by the LRA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUKAVU-EASTERN ZAIRE (APS) October 25 - Thousands of Hutu refugees from Rwanda and Burundi are streaming north to the Bukavu high plateau in eastern Zaire, after fleeing fighting further south and triggering fears of a new humanitarian disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 300,000 refugees have left their camps around Uvira, near the border with Burundi and fled to the Bukavu high plateau for fear of getting caught up in fighting between Zairean troops and ethnic Tutsis, which has already made relief operations impossible, according to United Nations staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean officials have accused the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan and Burundian governments of backing armed groups of ethnic Tutsis, known as Banyamulenge, who have lived in eastern Zaire for nearly two centuries and are now demanding Zairean citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Zairean authorities want both the Banyamulenge and some 1.2 million Hutu refugees to leave the country, and have at the same time accused the Burundian and Rwandan army of supporting the Banyamulenge in their struggle against the Zairean government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Hutu groups have also accused Burundian and Rwandan armies of being behind the attack by the Banyamulenge in their current fighting against Zairean forces in an effort to realise a Tutsi-Hima empire that would involve Tutsis in Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda, charges strongly denied by both Bujumbura and Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the situation in eastern Zaire was fast moving towards a humanitarian catastrophe, Burundi's army, which like Rwanda denied supporting the Banyamulenge, said on October 22 that exiled Hutu rebels from Zaire had carried out a raid over the border, attacking the town of Cibitoke for 90 minutes in the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Isaie Nibizi said he did not know how many people were killed in the rebel attack on Cibitoke, which is less than five kilometres from the easily- crossed Rusizi river on the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he stated that four rebels were killed and a soldier wounded on October 21 in the Burarana district of Burundi's central western Muramvya province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Geneva, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Ron Redmond warned that the situation &quot;has now deteriorated to such an extent that we are almost back to an emergency phase like in 1994,&quot; a reference to the flow to Zaire of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans during their country's genocidal civil war, when Hutu extremists killed between 500,000 and one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus before Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels seized power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We appeal to all sides to step back from the brink of what now threatens to become a very real humanitarian disaster in a region that has suffered enough,&quot; the UNHCR spokesman added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bukavu and Goma, on the northern and southern shores of Lake Kivu, close to the border with Rwanda, are both already centres for camps housing more than a million mainly Rwandan Hutu refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighting between Zairean troops and the Banyamulenge also involves indigenous local tribes opposed to the presence of the ethnic Tutsis who have not been recognised by Zaireans, and had claimed at least 83 lives by the end of the third week of October, according to relief staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR said that 3,000 Rwandans had appeared in the Bukavu region on Monday evening and had gone to the Nyengezi-Mulwa camp, where aid workers were to assess their health and food needs. Thousands more were arriving the following day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said troops had stopped the refugees getting any nearer Bukavu, 26 kilometres from Nyegezi. Relief officials said about 100 refugees had reached the town itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most of the refugees were still hiding out in the hills and banana plantations around Uvira, which also form ideal terrain for guerrilla activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They and we are at the mercy of a security situation that is so dangerous and chaotic that it is impossible at this time to predict the outcome,&quot; Redmond said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting is also taking place around refugee camps north of Bukavu, near the town of Goma, according to aid workers. This region is home to ethnic Rwandan Hutus and Tutsis, known as the Banyarwanda, as well as indigenous people and refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disastrous situation in the region, long prone to strife between traditionally dominant Tutsis and the farming Hutu majority, blew up with the Rwandan civil war of 1994 and mass bloodshed in Burundi, where an estimated 150,000 people have died in an escalating conflict since the assassination of that country's first Hutu president Melchior Ndadaye in October 1993.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA (APS) October 25 - Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has bowed to immense political pressure and announced that his country would go to the polls on November 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am happy to announce that both presidential and parliamentary elections should be held on November 18, 1996,&quot; Chiluba said at a campaign rally in the central Kabwe town, some 130 kilometres north of here, on October 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told cheering supporters of his governing Movement for Multi- party Democracy (MMD) that elections would be held under the newly- amended controversial 1996 constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba, who also announced the dissolution of parliament, maintained there would be no vacuum in the political leadership of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be no vacuum ... there will only be a government. There will be no single day when there will be no president,&quot; Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remain president before, during and after elections, until I hand over the presidency either to myself or somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba had remained silent on the election date, hence brewing widespread anxiety among Zambians as the end of his mandate drew closer on October 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba's silence had infuriated opposition parties which accused him of trying to extend his term of office illegally, adding they would not recognise him after October 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts here argued that by dissolving parliament, Chiluba also dissolved his office because the presidency is tied to the life of the national assembly, but Chiluba said his MMD party would not be intimidated by anyone at all, stressing &quot;We are in government, we intend to be in government and maintain law and order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coming elections could, however, be the bloodiest in Zambia's history, political pundits said, after riots broke out in the country the same day Chiluba was announcing the new election date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence erupted after Chiluba announced the nomination of a junior minister, Paul Tembo, to stand in the Kabwe constituency, instead of a popular local businessman, Austin Chewe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police used batons against youths after hundreds went on the rampage, stoning local shops and cars. Police were acting on the orders of the president who told officers to &quot;sort them out,&quot; state- run television reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Kenneth Kaunda also announced on October 23 that his party will boycott the November 18 general elections and predicted that Chiluba's government would fall within six months after the polls through demonstrations and strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In three to six months this government will fall; that is, if there will be elections at all,&quot; he told a news conference, and pledged: &quot;We are determined to keep the peace as we fight for our rights and rights of fellow Zambians against the evil perpetrated by (the government) through its manipulation of the constitution and the electoral process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda, who ruled Zambia for 27 years, was effectively barred from running for president by a constitutional amendment passed by Chiluba's government earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His United National Independence Party (UNIP) is the biggest opposition party in the Zambian parliament, holding 26 of the 150 seats, and apart from refusing to put up an alternative candidate, it now appears prepared to sacrifice its parliamentary seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new law says the president must be at least a second-generation Zambian.  Kaunda was born in Zambia but his parents immigrated from Malawi around the turn of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda was also ruled out by another amendment which limits the president to two terms in office -- a move which he said should not be made retroactive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The barring of Kaunda, just five years after he introduced the multiparty democracy which swept him from power, was widely criticised by Western donor nations, some of which suspended millions of dollars in aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said officials from his party would tour the country to campaign against Chiluba's government, which he accused of &quot;subverting the legislative process so as to prevent any alternative government from contesting and winning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he would not lead the country into violence, he said, &quot;I will fight them through demonstrations.&quot; Kaunda also condemned the voter registration exercise carried out by an Israeli firm, Nikuv, saying that of 4.6 million eligible voters just 2.2 million had been registered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAIRO (APS) October 25 - Egyptian security forces have arrested 56 Shiite Muslims accused of belonging to an underground group linked to Iran, but the Iranian government immediately denied it had any links with the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an announcement by Egypt's Interior Ministry here on October 21, the suspects, arrested in five provinces, &quot;had begun implementing a plan to flood Egypt with publications and cassettes to spread Shiite thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The organization's leaders have visited Iran where they made contacts with both Iranian and Arab Shiite religious leaders,&quot; the ministry statement added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police had seized 100,000 Egyptian pounds (29,500 US dollars) that was to finance the group and came &quot;from internal and external sources,&quot; while computers, printing machines, various publications and cassette tapes made by Shiite Muslim leaders were also confiscated, the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrests were made in the provinces of Cairo, Giza, Shargiya, Dakhalia and Gharbia, the statement said, without indicating over what time-frame they had been carried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said those arrested &quot;were recruited after they were inculcated with Shiite ideas with a view toward sending them to Iran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Iran, they &quot;would be trained in anticipation of the unification of underground Shiite groups through something known as the Supreme Shiite Council in Egypt,&quot; the statement added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The members of the network are &quot;expected to infiltrate some political parties and use them to spread Iranian objectives and extremist plans,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Interior Ministry gave the names of eight &quot;leaders&quot; of the clandestine organization -- two merchants, two civil servants, a teacher, a doctor, a driver and a man with no profession, saying they had visited Iran and been in contact with Iranian Shiite leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preacher Mohammed Hassan Shehata, arrested recently in Cairo for alleged Shiite preaching, &quot;played a vital role in the execution of the Shiite plan,&quot; the ministry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the beginning of the year, the state security services have infiltrated this underground Shiite organization and observed its leaders and members, who formed cells and recruited extremists with the goal of making Egypt into another Iran,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 56 arrested individuals will be brought before the state security prosecutor, who has begun an inquiry, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on October 23, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said a statement strongly denied any link between Iran and an undeground Shiite Muslim group in Egypt, saying Cairo was trying to shift the blame for unrest at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We regret Egypt's having to accuse other countries from time to time in a bid to justify its inability to run the country. It is a proven fact that Egypt's troubles are a doment affair,&quot; Velayati said in a statement released in Tehran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran has repeatedly stated that it in no way interferes in the internal affairs of other countries,&quot; Velayati added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomatic relations with Egypt have been severed since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. Tehran denies involvement in the Islamic militant violence in Egypt that has killed more than 1,000 people since 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt, home to 60 million predominantly Sunni Muslim inhabitants, counts 500,000 Shiites among the population, according to Shiite sources, but police sources put the community' number at only a few thousands strong. Egypt was a bastion of the Shiite sect during the Fatimid era (909-1171) before turning to Suni Islam.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NZARA-SOUTHERN SUDAN (APS) October 25 - Thousands of Sudanese Catholics and other faithful on October 20 commemorated the death of Bishop Daniel Comboni, the founder of the Christian faith in the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Comboni died in 1881 at the age of 51. He was proclaimed Blessed by Pope John Paul II in March 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day-long ceremony, led by Fr. David Glenday, the Superior General of the Comboni Missionaries took place in the south-western Sudanese town of Nzara, about 1,170 kilometres from the capital Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It attracted delegations from Rome, Zaire, Sudan and Uganda. Father Peter Lwaminda of the Nairobi-based Association of Member Episcopal Conferences for Eastern Africa (AMECEA) was also among those who attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The holy mass which was conducted in English, Arabic, Dinka and the local Azande language was led by host Bishop Joseph Gasi of Tambura Yambio Diocese.  The Apostolic Administrator of Rumbek Diocese, Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari and Max Macram Gassis of El-Obeid,all in southern Sudan, were also present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fr. Glenday had earlier presided over similar ceremonies in Khartoum on October 10, El Obeid on October 13 and at Dilling on October 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The late Bishop Daniel Comboni, an Italian, born at Limone on Lake Garda (Brescia, Italy), began his missionary work in Africa at the tender age of 26.  Moved by the situation of human suffering in the region, he embarked on a mission to make Africa a better place to live in and was to spend the rest of his life shuttling between Europe and Africa in pursuit of his goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keeping to his motto Africa or Death, the late Comboni presented an appeal, Postulatum pro Nigris, to the Fathers of the first Vatican Council in 1870, founded two missionary institutes and was made the head of the Apostolic Vicariate of Central Africa, first as Pro-vicar in 1872, then as Vicar Apostolic and Bishop in 1877.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today the congregation of Comboni Missionaries has 1,800 priests and over 2, 000 nuns. There are 14 provinces of the Comboni Missionaries in Africa, two of which are in the Sudan. Others are in Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides spreading the gospel and participating in relief work, the Comboni Missionaries have established and are responsible for the running of several development projects particularly in Africa's troubled spots. They have also set up and run schools and health institutions in different parts of the world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi (APS) October 25 - An official of the Vatican Embassy here has cautioned the African people to guard against divisions on ethnic lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethnic identity must not become an instrument of hatred, he said, stressing that &quot;those who are guilty of this crime in Africa, exploit ethnic identity in their struggle for power and wealth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monsignor Edgar Pena-Parra made these remarks, here on October 20 when he presided over a colourful mass to mark the 18th anniversary of the inauguration of the pontifical reign of the incumbent Catholic pontiff, Pope John Paul II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although the day falls on October 22, we decided to mark it today (Sunday October 20) to coincide with the church's Mission Sunday,&quot; Monsignor Pena- Parra told members of the press at the end of the Eucharist Mass.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Vatican official, who represented the Vatican Ambassador to Kenya Archbishop Giovanni Tonucci, &quot;no ethnic group may take for itself the privilege of being in the right and having power,&quot; for, he stressed...&quot; every individual, every cultural group, is unique and has the right to exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some African countries, the issue of ethnic differences, has led to ethnic clashes between and among tribes and communities, resulting in bloodshed. Such countries include Rwanda and Burundi, where large scale ethnic differences between Tutsis and Hutus in both countries respectively, have led to massive loss of lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monsignor Pena-Parra urged the rich countries in the North to continue supporting African countries in the latter's efforts to battle with the problems of refugees, poverty, economic and cultural under development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continuing gap between the rich and poor regions of the world is a serious threat to global stability, said Monsignor Pena-Parra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moral imperative of solidarity is fundamentally linked to human nature itself and to the absolute need which human beings have for one another. This need must be met at the level of nations and continents, otherwise living together in harmony becomes impossible, the Vatican representative told hundreds of faithful attending the mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing that Africa is at cross-roads, Monsignor Pena-Parra urged the African people and their leaders to exercise all their wisdom in the difficult and urgent task of promoting a development which is not just economic and material, but one that would involve building a civilisation of respect for all members of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mission of the church is not normally seen in the real way especially when speaking out on social issues such as the dignity of the human person, human rights, justice and peace among other issues, Monsignor Pena-Parra told the congregation at the Holy Family Basilica here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a text prepared to mark the event, people often ask the question why the Pope visits Africa so often. This is explained in the understanding that Africa is the continent of the family, and the future of the church's evangelisation mission passes through the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born Karol Wojtyla on May 18, 1920, the incumbent Catholic Pontiff is the son of a Polish sub-lieutenant in the army. He lost his mother at the age of 9 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wojtyla was brilliant at school and excelled at sports such as football, swimming, walking, canoeing and skiing. He entered the University of Cracow in 1938 and worked in a quarry, cutting stones at Slovak Chemical Works in 1940, while continuing his studies by himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young Polish joined an underground Catholic seminary in 1942 and was ordained priest in 1946. He became a bishop in 1958 at the age of 36 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope John Paul II was created pope on October 18, 1978' while his pontifical throne was inaugurated on October 22, the same year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first Catholic pontiff to come from the then Eastern Bloc, John Paul II succeeded Pope John Paul I (Albino Luciani), who died 33 days after his papal election. Before Paul I, was Pope John Paul VI, best remembered by African Christians as having visited Uganda in 1969, where he canonized the famous Ugandan Martyrs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC in KwaZulu Natal finds the attack of Chief MG Buthelezi, Minister of Home Affairs, on the government policy of affirmative action as an affront to the intelligence of Africans, Indians, Coloureds and women if the newspaper reports are correct. That Chief Buthelezi uttered these unfortunate words in the Conference of the IFP Women's Brigade is an insult to the very motherhood and the Titans of our nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the forces of apartheid no longer have the temerity to utter such words in the public. Chief Buthelezi's statement begs a question whether the IFP is still honest to its founding principle of freedom for the oppressed or it has become a front of the extreme white right- wing. Only the extreme white right-wing can be expected to find a fault with affirmative action.  Chief Buthelezi's statement is not surprising if one takes into account the IFP's recent history of its members being trained, armed and deployed by the fascist elements within the apartheid security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps for Chief Buthelezi to be efficient you must be a lawyer, male, white, Italian and foreign. The ANC calls upon the Government of National Unity and the private sector to ensure that the programmes to uplift those sections of our society whom apartheid discriminated against are accelerated.  In fact, if there is anything to bemoan, it is that affirmative action is not yet being fully implemented. Most Africans, Indians, Coloureds and women recently promoted to higher positions were not promoted because of affirmative action. They qualify to those positions on their own merit. They were only discriminated against by apartheid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC in KwaZulu Natal is surprised that the problem around the employment of Mario Ambrosini, the Italian foreign adviser of the Minister of Home Affairs, is not resolved as yet even though there is a government resolution not to employ foreigners. That it is alleged that Ambrossini has incurred expenses of about R1/2 million in two years on top of his R28 000 per month salary and the claim by the Director- General of Home Affairs that Ambrosini had done no work of the department, shows that the decision to call Ambrosini to appear before the Home Affairs Committee is too little and too late.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The taxpayers can no longer afford to pay for advisers who seemingly are not doing their work but instead act as advisers of political parties. The taxpayers cannot fund the IFP under apartheid and again in the new political dispensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC in KwaZulu Natal calls upon the GNU to implement its decision not to employ foreigners. The continued employment of Ambrosini betrays political indecision and chicanery.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - This is number 32 (22 - 27 October 1996) in a series of weekly reports from IRIN on general developments in the Great Lakes region. Sources for the information below include UN agencies, NGOs, other international organisations and media reports. IRIN issues these reports for the benefit of the humanitarian community, but accepts no responsibility as to the accuracy of the original sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weekly Roundup of Main Events in the Great Lakes region</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The past week has witnessed a dramatic escalation in the conflict in South and North Kivu, Zaire, with two zones of fighting spreading upwards from Uvira towards Bukavu and southwards from Rutshuru towards Goma in North Kivu. Uvira town is believed to have been taken by Banyamulenge rebels, who have established control over most of the area between Uvira and Bukavu, including border areas with Burundi and Rwanda. By mid-week, Banyamulenge- dominated forces had taken Kamanyola and pushed the Zairean Army back beyond Nyangezi, less than 30 kms south of Bukavu. Zairean Army officers are reported to have moved their families out of Bukavu and the army has mounted defensive positions around the town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Saturday morning, at least 80,000 mainly Rwandan refugees from the Uvira camps were believed to be on the move towards Bukavu, while the whereabouts of 140,000 Burundian refugees from the Uvira camps remained unclear. As the fighting spread north early in the week, it also prompted the flight of probably 53,000 Rwandan refugees from the four most southern Bukavu camps, and more recently reports have emerged that refugees are fleeing some of the camps north of Bukavu. Panzi camp, only 10 kms south of Bukavu is the latest to have dispersed. At the same time, local Zairean people are being displaced from their homes. Very rough estimates suggest that 15,000 people have been displaced in Fizi zone, 30,000 between Uvira and Bukavu and 10,000 in the environs of Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two refugee camps on the northern axis near Goma were attacked during the weekend, prompting a mass movement of Rwandan refugees. Kibumba camp, about 25 kms north of Goma, was hit by firing between 9pm on Friday and 6am on Saturday morning, prompting its 194,000 refugees to flee as well as about 12, 000 Zaireans from nearby villages. These Zairean displaced were assisted by ICRC at Kanyaruchina, about 10 km north of Goma. As of Monday morning, some 3, 200 people were reported to have crossed into Rwanda at the Mutura crossing point, east of Kibumba, of whom about 2,500 were believed to be Zairean and 703 Rwandans from Kibumba. They will be catered for at two separate facilities in Gisenyi prefecture. There may have been other arrivals in Rwanda during Sunday, but the situation is unclear. UNHCR reports that, as of Monday morning, about 110,000 refugees from Kibumba have arrived in camps along the western axis, the majority in Mugunga and some in Lac Vert. The rest are expected to arrive during Monday. At least four refugees were confirmed to have died in the attack on Kibumba and another 100 were wounded.  A further 10,000 displaced Zaireans are taking refugee at Mugunga camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday night armed men mounted an attack on Katale camp, 55 kms north of Goma, which left one Zairean soldier dead and three others wounded. The attacks are widely alleged to have been instigated by Rwandan soldiers or elements supported by the Rwandese Patriotic Army. According to some press reports, the firing on Kibumba camp came from across the Rwandan border, which lies only 300 metres away from the edge of the camp. The Rwandan Government's spokesman hotly denied the allegation in a BBC interview on Sunday night. The population of Katale camp have not yet moved from the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The past week also witnessed a growing number of attacks by local people against Tutsis living in Goma town and Kinshasa. Some Tutsis in Goma, who have played a prominent role in the town's business life, have been harassed, had their property stolen and forced to leave for Rwanda. There are no reports of local authorities making any attempt to bring these attacks to a halt. Goma's climate of uncertainty was further exacerbated on Sunday by the temporary closure of the airport. According to the Rwandan Foreign Minister, Anastase Gasana, Rwandan students at the University of Kinshasa and other educational institutions in the city were attacked and had their property stolen during the weekend. As of Sunday night, 40 students were reported to be at an &quot;unknown location&quot; in Kinshasa having been denied permission to board a flight to Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports have also emerged that there has been fighting around Rutshuru town, about 70 kms north of Goma, and that Rutshuru has been taken by 'rebels'. It is possible that these rebels are Bangilima, a militia made up of local ethnic groups whose stated aim is to counter the spreading influence of Rwandan Hutu refugees in North Kivu. Equally it could be that they are Zairean Tutsis or elements supported by the Rwandese Patriotic Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing insecurity throughout Kivu prompted the evacuation of all international humanitarian personnel from Uvira and 128 international staff from Bukavu on 26 October. Some non-essential international staff were also flown out of Goma. The fighting has closed off Uvira's lake Tanganyika port and the major land routes between Uvira, Bukavu, Goma and Kampala are also either insecure or unsuitable for large quantities of supplies. As a result, WFP is having to consider airlifts to meet food needs in the region, as stocks in Kivu are close to being exhausted. These constraints are compounded by the difficulty of getting accurate information on population movements and by problems of access as refugees flee to the west. The UNHCR estimates that there are currently 500,000 refugees and displaced people on the move in Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations between the Governments of Rwanda and Zaire are at an all-time low, with Zaire repeating allegations that Rwandan and Burundian troops are operating on Zairean territory in support of the Banyamulenge, to repeated Rwandan and Burundian denials. The Zairean Foreign Ministry on Wednesday called in ambassadors from the Permanent Five members of the Security Council to announce that Zaire intended to take to the Security Council charges that Rwanda and Burundi have invaded Zaire's territory. Zaire's allegations were backed on Wednesday by the National Council for the Defence of Democracy, the main Burundian Hutu rebel group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Banyamulenge last week stated that the rebels want to take Bukavu and link up with forces fighting in North Kivu in a bid to overthrow President Mobutu. Muller Ruhimbika, from Kigali, claiming to represent the hitherto unknown Democratic Alliance of the People, said that they were working in alliance with three other opposition groups - the Popular Revolutionary Party, the National Resistance Council for Democracy and the Revolutionary Movement for the Liberation of Zaire. President Mobutu continues to undergo treatment for cancer in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the Swiss Foreign Minister on Thursday granted him a visa with no specified duration to enable him to continue his treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing crisis is prompting a flurry of diplomatic statements and activity. Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has urged Rwandan refugees to consider returning to Rwanda and asked them to 'remember that 80,000 refugees have recently returned home to Rwanda from Burundi, and UNHCR and UN human rights observers report that they are now busy resuming normal lives.' The US Government also encouraged the refugees to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the UN Secretary-General has called for a ceasefire and expressed his support for a regional conference to address what he called a 'regional war'. The OAU has backed the Secretary-General's call for a regional conference. The UN Special Envoy to Zaire, Ibrahima Fall, reportedly was seeking the support of Rwanda and Uganda for such a conference, which they had earlier opposed. France repeated its support for a regional conference during last week and over the weekend urged its nationals to leave Kivu. On Sunday, another 27 foreign nationals, the majority of them French, were evacuated from Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU and the Belgian Government are also attempting to broker peace talks between Kengo wa Dondo, Prime Minister of Zaire and Rwanda's President or Vice-President Paul Kagame. On Thursday Kengo wa Dondo publicly stated his desire for such talks and urged the Belgian government to help him. He was quoted in an AFP report as saying, &quot;I want to negotiate with the man who really holds power in Rwanda and not the appearance of power. You all know that it's Mr Kagame&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Five civilians and ten Hutu rebels were killed during an October 27 attack on a camp for displaced people in Bukeye commune in Burundi's central Muramvya province. Burundian state radio linked the attack to increased rebel activity in northwest Burundi after attacks on refugee camps in adjoining areas of eastern Zaire. Some observers fear that Hutu rebels pushed out of camps in North and South Kivu could launch attacks in northwest Burundi if they attempt to cross Burundi to reach Hutu refugee camps in western Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The Burundian military reported October 24 that it was fighting Hutu rebels near the Zairian border, although there was no indication of the number of casualties on either side. Skirmishes are frequent in Cibitoke province, with endemic insecurity making the area inaccessible to international NGOs and humanitarian agencies. According to a military spokesman, a civilian truck was ambushed the same day on the Bujumbura - Cibitoke road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee (RSCC), meeting on October 21, agreed to exempt a variety of relief items from the embargo placed on Burundi on humanitarian grounds. The items, in suifficient quantity to supply 250,000 displaced people are: food, bean seeds, water purification agents, blankets, plastic sheeting, jerry cans and buckets, cooking materials (pots and utensils) and mats. The UN agencies and NGOs will need to clear shipments with the RSCC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The governor of Cibitoke province, Lieutenant-Colonel Marcel Sinarinzi, was assassinated October 23 in an ambush in the province. Six of his bodyguards were also killed in the attack. No details on the circumstances surrounding the attack were available. The Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People claimed responsibility for the ambush, and said that it had also attacked a military camp in Cibitoke. The group claims to control 80 percent of the province. Hutu rebel groups often target high ranking Burundian government officials, and the governor of Cibitoke is one of several governors who have been killed since the current conflict began in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Rwandan state radio reported October 24 that sixteen prisoners awaiting trial on genocide charges suffocated to death in Gitesi prison in Kibuye in southwest Rwanda. More than 81,000 prisoners are packed into Rwanda's prisons.  Most are Hutu prisoners accused of massacres in 1994 in which Hutu hardliners killed almost half a million Tutsi and moderate Hutu.  International human rights groups have criticized the Rwandan government for the conditions in which suspects are held in the country's prisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># UNHCR reported that unidentified gunman killed 16 Sudanese refugees and seriously wounded five others in an October 24 attack on a settlement in northern Uganda. A UNHCR spokeswoman said that gunmen launched a seven-hour attack on Palorinya refugee settlement, looting and destroying many thatched mud huts. An estimated 40 percent of the huts were destroyed in the settlement which is home to 21,000 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Ugandan police in Kampala fired in the air and fired teargas on October 24 to disperse rampaging Makerere University students who were protesting government plans to force students to pay new university fees. Students shattered the windscreen of a vehicle escorting Ugandan Vice-President Wandira Kazibwe who was passing by the university during the demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The Ugandan government ordered striking medical workers to return to work by noon October 25 or be risk being fired. Doctors and other medical staff went on strike earlier in the week demanding pay increases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Institute of Wine Biotechnology grew out of a new initiative called the Technology and Human Resources for Industry Programme (Thrip), which is administered by the Foundation for Research Development (FRD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme brings together industry, academic research and government in projects designed to serve national interests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way it works is this: if industry puts money into a Thrip-approved project, the Department of Trade and Industry matches the grants by putting in at least 50 cents for every rand invested by the companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases, the department will match the funding on a one-to-one basis.  For example, in projects where there are five or more students, the department will match the industry grant if more than half are black or female.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Projects are jointly managed by the academic and industrial partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the Wine Biotechnology Institute, Thrip funds about 78 projects involving 56 companies. Two of the bigger projects are the Catalysis Research Unit at the University of Cape Town and the Sasol Separation Technology Unit at Potchefstroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During 1995, the Catalysis Research Unit under Professor Cyril O'Connor received joint funding of about R1,6-million. The funding came from the Department of Trade and Industry, companies AECI, Sastech and Sentrachem and the FRD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sasol Separation Technology Centre under Professor Piet Steyn received funding to the value of R1,5-million through the Thrip initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, funding from industry for Thrip projects totalled R10,9-million, while the department's contribution was R5,6-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Dr Tjaart van der Walt, FRD Director responsible for Thrip: &quot;Thrip has tremendous growth potential. Compared with a budget of R17-million in 1995, the programme's size is projected to exceed the R50-million mark in 1996. We are aiming at a R250-million programme by the year 2000.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Professor Sakkie Pretorius and his family had started packing, getting ready to move across the world. He'd been offered a dream job - head of a big research institute in New Zealand, where he would have the staff and resources to work in his field, microbiology. But it meant leaving Stellenbosch and friends and family in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the wine industry finalised a plan that had been in the pipeline for months and decided to fund a wine research institute. It would be at Stellenbosch University, and they wanted Pretorius to run it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">#Pretorius still smiles and shakes his head as he remembers the last-minute change in plans and how his life and his family's suddenly turned around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any regrets he may have had about the New Zealand job have been overtaken by his excitement at the new project, his plans for the new building and the good news that the Department of Trade and Industry will match part of the wine industry's R5-million contribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his story illustrates the importance of industry-academic co-operation in South Africa's science and technology sector: it allows for research opportunities that have, until recently, been rare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goals for the Institute of Wine Biotechnology are fairly simple: a growth in foreign earnings from wine and an increase in income and jobs in rural wine communities. It will also tackle problems that come up for producers, winemakers and wholesalers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But achieving those goals takes sophisticated methods. Wine, despite its romantic image of vats and vineyards, is as technological as the next industry. And wine industries all over the world compete for a slice of the market and have to be abreast of the latest wine-drinking fashions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretorius says that South Africa is ranked 20th in the world in terms of hectares under grapevine, but ranked about eighth in terms of its products.  This is a good position, but holding on to it will take work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It starts with the vineyards: cultivating the right sorts of grapes, keeping pesticide levels down and developing agricultural methods. When its time for wine-making, you're into the science of enzymes and yeasts - an area Pretorius, as a world leader in microbiology, understands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">#&quot;In France, it is very fashionable to have spontaneous fermentation,&quot; he says. That's when wine-makers allow the yeasts already on the grapes to determine what kind of wine will develop. It gives the wine a complex character, because it has grown from a combination of many yeasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">#Most countries, however, go for one particular yeast. This means removing all yeasts already in the grapes and replacing them with one the winemakers know and understand. Although this makes for a simpler wine, it has some advantages - its predictability. Wine-drinkers know pretty much what they're going to get and some like familiarity (as the popularity of champagnes like Mot et Chandon shows).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretorius says the South African wine industry has decided on a middle way - not spontaneous fermentation, but using a combination of yeasts to get some complexity. The work of the wine institute will experiment with yeast combinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa does well in middle-range wines, but doesn't really compete internationally when it comes to top-class wines. This is another area for development, Pretorius says, as the high-quality wine market is very lucrative and would generate far more foreign income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">#Another area that is important is acidity: Pretorius says South African wines don't have the right acidity and, like many other countries, adds D- malic acid to adjust the wines. This was used as an excuse, one year, to take South African wines off European shelves, until South African wine-makers pointed out to the European Union that many other wines with D-malic acid were being sold from other countries. The EU relented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretorius says the problem arose from competitors in Germany, worried about the inroads South African wines were making into their markets. But it is important to head such problems off by knowing the technology (both here and internationally) so well that you can argue your case, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">#The institute will collaborate with Elsenburg Agricultural College and the Nietvoorbij Insitute for Viticulture and Oenology and also with international counterparts. Students will be sent to an institution in Adelaide, Australia - &quot;collaborating with the competition&quot;, Pretorius calls it - to learn from the successful Australian experience with wine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australians very cleverly decided to focus on Chardonnay, which has become a very popular wine in consumer countries. But they did well in other wines, too, and last year outdid South Africa in a wine competition, winning eight out of 11 categories - this despite being a relative newcomer to wine- making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This showed that South Africa's wine-makers can no longer rest on their laurels. Tradition is not the most vital ingredient for good wines - knowledge is. This new initiative will hopefully help South Africa catch up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Mac Maharaj details his department's new plan to modernise all aspects of South Africa's transport management</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all take the existence of roads, railways, airports and harbours for granted and only curse the inconvenience when confronted by traffic jams, accidents, ungovernable taxis and airport strikes. Still, in our better moments, most of us believe that a well developed and properly managed transport system is one of the keys to making our economy internationally competitive and realising our vision of inclusive social development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Transport has just completed 30 months under an African Nationalist Congress-led government. It has been a period of intense debate and profound re-orientation of priorities. From it has emerged a comprehensive new policy and a strategic plan to modernise all aspects of transport management. At the same time, we have made a start on some of the massive projects that will be needed to move goods and people in the first part of the 21st century.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department is responsible for 7 000km of our national road network. It regulates and administers shipping and aviation (the pilots, the planes and the 57 airlines that fly into South Africa). It co-ordinates road traffic for eight million vehicles (which cause 460 000 accidents each year), and oversees the related MMF Fund (third party insurance) which pays out more than R1- billion to accident victims. It manages subsidies for buses and railways which move two million passengers every day, while it tries to regulate and help formalise the 130 000 taxis (60 000 of which do not have permits) that currently compete for the remaining two million passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Transport White Paper was adopted by Cabinet in September 1996. The consultation process used to develop the White Paper was guided by three key needs. They are the need for a more export-oriented and internationally competitive economy; the need for an efficiently integrated goods and public transport system; the need for a cohesive legislative and institutional framework to manage transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the most important aspects of the new policy include: reducing the role of the government in operations and focusing on policy, planning and regulating; supporting social and economic development by using partnerships between the public and private sectors for the delivery of infrastructure and services; contracting out bus and rail services in a competitive and regulated environment and drawing the taxi industry into the formal transport system; and grappling with the carnage on our roads (10 000 deaths per year), through a comprehensive programme linking education and enforcement with engineering solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these 30 months we have notched up some significant achievements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Maputo Corridor. This project is one of four corridor initiatives the department is involved in with Trade and Industry. It unlocks economic investment potential along the shortest export route from Gauteng to Maputo (through Mpumalanga) by mobilising private sector resources to provide the infrastructure. The first crucial step will be taken in November, when a contract to build and operate an R800-million toll road on the N4 will be awarded on a 30 year concession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the corridor development, large- scale economic investment projects such as the cross-frontier park between Mozambique and South Africa, the building of a R4- billion aluminium smelter and a major titanium mining project in Tzaneen are being dimensioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Roads. In the past two years we have issued contracts for the building of roads worth R2- billion. The N2, which will now link our busiest general cargo port in Durban to our biggest port in Richards Bay, will be opened on November 25. Early next year we will be concessioning the N3, linking Durban to Gauteng, to the private sector. This project will involve R1-billion of new construction. The N1, which is the vital link between South Africa and our northern neighbours, will be opening in April next year. Each of these contracts has stipulated that 12,5% of the work should go to small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) and 12,5% should be labour-intensive, resulting already in the creation of thousands of new jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have also been allocated R100-million from Reconstruction and Development funds to spend on roads in dangerous condition. We have already spent R40-million and created 70 000 person-days of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Metropolitan Corridors. Four have been planned to make our cities more efficient and to begin overcoming the economic irrationality and reducing the human stress caused by apartheid planners who placed dormitory townships 30km away from industrial areas. In Cape Town work has started on the Phillipi corridor, which will link the old townships and squatter areas to Wynberg and promote medium-density housing, light industry and social services along a major public transport route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Restructuring of state assets. The key aims here are to generate funding, improve competition, and extend services in transport. The department has adopted a mixed approach - from outright privatisation (Sun Air), to strategic equity partnerships (Airports and South African Airways) and concessions, where the assets remain state- owned but operation is contracted out. The Cabinet has approved the proposals, negotiations with labour are well-advanced, and we can expect to see the first fruits within months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Public Transport. Legislation based on the White Paper will be presented to Parliament early next year - but implementation has already begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Buses. Under the inherited subsidy system, bus operators had permits for life along routes which they determined and monopolised.  &gt;From now on, however, operators will have to sign &quot;interim contracts&quot; with the department for a specified duration, after which they will have to compete for newly defined routes based on transport plans taking into account user and community-determined needs. The subsidy will no longer be restricted, as at present, to purchasers of weekly or monthly tickets, but will be based on bus kilometres travelled, so that all users will benefit equally. This is the beginning of a fundamental transformation in public transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rail services. These are currently provided on a contract basis by Metro Rail of Transnet via a deficit financing arrangement through which losses are subsidised and there is no incentive to reduce the current 30% to 40% rate of fare evasion, cut operating costs or improve quality of service. An interim measure is to change the contract to a &quot;concession&quot;-type contract which is output rather than cost-based, thus creating some risk as well as an incentive to perform better. This is a prelude to concessioning the operation on a competitive basis to whichever operator, public or private, offers the best price to operate the service for a set period of time, while guaranteeing maintenance and extension of the infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Taxis. Despite the valuable service they have offered to urban commuters, they become a byword for violent lawlessness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NTTT (National Taxi Task Team) has produced a detailed set of recommendations on regulation, formalisation and economic assistance. These are being implemented now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;Arm's-length agencies&quot; and a lean department. The department is going to the Cabinet this month with proposals for setting up a national agency to manage roads. The agency will be funded by a portion of the fuel levy and will be responsible for implementation, while the department retains its crucial regulatory function. Similar agencies are planned for aviation and shipping. These agencies will be professionally managed at arm's-length from government under a board of directors, dominated by private-sector users of their services. Once they are in place, the effect will be dramatically to reduce the staff of the department, from 1 400 to 400.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Traffic Management. The computerised National Traffic Information System (NaTIS) is 80% implemented and will be complete next year. A tender has just been awarded for a new credit card driver's licence which, linked to NaTIS, will allow us to introduce a points demerit system for regular offenders, capture data on all offences and thereby guarantee full payment of fines before a licence is re-issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans are well advanced for the building of 128 traffic control centres on our major roads to police overloading and ensure compliance with vehicle roadworthiness standards. The first five of these centres are under construction. We have also secured investment funding from the MMF to improve safety on our roads. These are some elements of a very comprehensive plan to reduce fatalities by 10% by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watch this space. The political, strategic and management framework for revitalising transport is firmly in place. We are excited and confident, as 1997 approaches, that the whole country will soon be doing the locomotion for real.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - This week's guest writer Mandla Langa gives a personal account of his time as chair of Comtask</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poet friend and comrade of mine who spent nearly three decades of his exile in the United States, speaks of menacing racist graffito sprayed on Alabama walls at the beginning of the civil rights movement. One particularly inspired scrawl warns: Nigger, if you can read this sign, you'd better run for your life. In fact, even if you can't read it, you'd better run anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This message stayed with me at the first meeting of the Communications Task Group (Comtask) on January 14 as we posed for a group photograph in the first floor auditorium of the South African Communication Services in Smal Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apropos of nothing, a series of questions bugged me: what happened to the African American who couldn't read the message? Or to a blind one? Did it mean that, since the Ku Klux Klan had communicated, however informally, with the people for whom the message was meant, they had justification to set upon anyone unfortunate enough to be lingering in the danger zone?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Access to information and communication - and delivery mechanisms - suddenly assumed a different feature; to be outside the information &quot;loop&quot; was akin to being up the proverbial creek without a paddle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brief from Deputy President Thabo Mbeki required Comtask to examine government communications at the local, provincial and international level, to make recommendations on new policies, structures and budgets. There was a need to look into training and affirmative action, the way in which ownership of the media affects government communication, and South Africa's international information dissemination. Comtask was asked to draw on the experience and best practice of other democracies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task group got a stormy reception, in accordance with the principle that no prophet is appreciated in his or her own backyard. One or two editorials trashed it, one journalist opining that what government communications needed was &quot;three or four journalists&quot; and the job would be done and everyone would go home and have a beer. This brought to mind the unpolitically correct joke of a white foreman who watches a group of white men putting up a building in London. &quot;Just give me 40 kaffirs,&quot; he says, &quot;and I'll do the job single-handedly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Academic Ruth Tomaselli called us &quot;government hacks&quot;, causing us to wonder whether this dismissal was not occasioned by a sense of pique. Some of us shrugged this off as hollow howls of a gadfly and read the subtext beneath the brickbats: How dare Mbeki institute a process without first checking with us?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other overriding suspicion was that Mbeki wanted a justification for regulation over the media. What this ignores is the calibre of people in Comtask. Raymond Louw is a doyen of South African journalism. In his veins, one might say, runs the blood of press freedom. David Dison is a lawyer who has been involved in matters relating to freedom of the media, especially in the broadcast area. Mathatha Tsedu, now a Nieman Fellow, is the political editor of the Sowetan. Steve Godfrey, the only Canadian in the group, works for the Commonwealth Secretariat, a structure which stands consistently for press freedom. Tsepo Rantho was president of the National Community Media Forum. Val Pauquet had worked for Deutsche Welle and is familiar with censorship. Sebiletso Mokone-Matabane is an Independent Broadcasting Authority councillor; Professor Willem De Klerk is a former editor and media consultant for whom press freedom is the first principle. And Stephen Mncube, from the Development Bank of Southern Africa, has wide international experience, especially in the provision of information to far-flung communities. Anyone gifted with the merest mustard grain of imagination would have known that these people would not endanger press freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some muted disapprobation came from self- styled protectors from the same political parties which have shied away from making submissions to Comtask.  This provides a piquant flavouring to a screamingly unfunny political joke, really, because structures of civil society, to whom these politicians are presumably accountable, have lauded the courage which informed this process, and even pledged sums of money and resources for the training of future communicators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these are the smarts that come with any inquiry. A lesser-known fact is that the Commonwealth Secretariat, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) , Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) contributed much to the process, significantly lowering costs to government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the Commonwealth Secretariat, Dr Paul Lusaka was seconded to the task group, and he helped plan trips to African countries. We all miss him now, his warmth and his unflappable, avuncular style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comtask held 37 full meetings, all of them open to the public. In March, advertisements calling on individuals and institutions to make submissions were placed in national and regional newspapers and on radio stations in nine official languages. To date, we have received 150 written submissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes, these submissions had a surreal quality to them, such as when one of my colleagues - I forget who - asked during a presentation by the disabled whether it were possible to invent a radio for the deaf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I remember the angst over the budget when we were planning our international investigations. But, finally, with financial and technical assistance from the UNDP and Commonwealth Secretariat, we travelled in teams of twos and threes to eight developed and 11 developing countries to research international perspectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathatha, Raymond and I went to Canada, to Brazil, and to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in Rio that I saw the favelas, the slums which defy imagination. But what distinguishes them for our squatter camps is the elegance of Brazilian poverty: in the most rundown favela there will be a television set and a satellite dish. I knew, then, why this country had given birth to writers such as Jorge Armado and Machado de Assis. Nowhere else do you find such a heady mix of poverty and splendour, madness and a frustrating pragmatism, all under the unwavering gaze of Christo Redemptor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, much more importantly, the people in the international arena treated us with respect, praying that our task would deepen the South African miracle about which they had heard so much. They seemed to say: We have tried and haven't managed to get it right. We are stricken by pestilence and poverty, and our destiny, the bettering of our lot, is somehow irreversibly intertwined with yours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early this month, Comtask held a colloquium of communicators and stakeholders in Caledon to provide a &quot;road map&quot; through which a new comprehensive communications route could be charted. I must admit to a certain amount of trepidation before Caledon, because some of our findings had already been aired in the media and there was a possibility of bedlam over the South African Communication Service (SACS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My fears were confirmed when Chris Vick, Gauteng's director of communications, praised the process that Comtask had embarked on. &quot;But,&quot; he said, &quot;to use Mandla's own analogy of the road-map, we are all here on a journey, and there is a wounded animal lying on the road. And that animal is SACS.&quot; I could have killed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the heat of the moment, Louw stood up and said that &quot;SACS will be closed down&quot; - and all hell broke loose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This knotty problem was resolved in the commission which dealt with the future structures of government communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comtask has had a two-day bosberaad to fine- tune its findings and recommendations which will form the basis of the report to the deputy president next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process has changed Comtask members and shaped their apprehension of the imperatives of communications. It was in the words and eyes of the young First Nation woman we met in Ottawa, and in the apprehension of the newspaper mogul over the latest depredations of the Ethiopian government, that we realised the importance of the task Mbeki had set for us. Because, nowhere else - at least in public - has there been such a review or transparency in the discussions of government communications budgets, personnel and structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have learnt to look at the world from the perspective of the illiterate and the disabled. As a country, we might never be able to solve all the problems, but it is in acknowledging their existence that people start to have a vision of the way forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story of this country has never been told for the simple reason that the structures we have set up throughout the shameful half- century of apartheid have impressed on us, black and white, the expediency of silence, or, a fluency in half-truths and obfuscation. And it is only when all the voices of this country are unleashed and given space that we will begin that rigorous journey to confront ourselves. The grim testimonies coming out of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission are just the tip of a bloody iceberg; the media and government still have to dig deeper to the marrow of what made certain men - some of whom are still occupying the seats of the mighty - such monsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When those who have been the wretched of the earth start taking control of the means of communication and information, this country will engage in a healing process. And - notwithstanding the snide comments from Washington of Simon Barber, who wrote what amounted to a stream of consciousness about Comtask - this is not the Unesco school of journalism talking. It's pure common sense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - This might be seen as the week of the killers as victims.  The amnesty committee of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been hearing five former members of the security branch confess to atrocities they carried out during the apartheid era. And SABC has been broadcasting a two- part documentary on the life story of Eugene de Kock.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the documentary and the amnesty application seek to do much the same thing - offer some understanding of the factors which led the perpetrators of human rights abuses to their present predicament: De Kock, as &quot;Prime Evil&quot;, facing justice in the Pretoria Supreme Court, and the Vlakplaas Five fleeing Nemesis in the form of Transvaal attorney general Jan d'Oliviera. But there the similarity ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial presentation, at least, by the Vlakplaas Five to the truth commission smacks of hypocrisy. The absence of any fresh disclosures as to the activities of the Vlakplaas unit strengthens the impression that all the applicants seek to do is explain away the crimes for which they have no hope of escaping responsibility. The supporting statement by former commissioner of police Johan van der Merwe is of a piece with that: his assurance, for example, that care was taken by police to avoid acting as agents provocateurs when they supplied booby-trapped grenades to anti-apartheid activists is, to put it politely, mendacious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outstanding SABC documentary, by contrast, came straight from the heart of its producer and director, Jacques Pauw - an Afrikaner who was in effect examining his own sense of guilt for the atrocities of the apartheid era as well as the culpability of the likes of De Kock. He pulled no punches; Vlakplaas - where men were strung upside down by their ankles and had burning sticks thrust up their rectums - was clearly a place of the utmost depravity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is in the production of the film that Pauw in effect answers the excuses made by the Vlakplaas Five - the familiar pleas of social conditioning and obedience to higher authority. In the admirable tradition of the likes of Bram Fischer and Beyers Naud , Pauw - whose grandmother was born in a Boer War concentration camp - demonstrates that the circumstances of one's birth are not the determinants of the moral quality of one's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spirit of reconciliation which has accompanied the transition to democracy has seen something of a stampede to extend &quot;forgiveness&quot; to those responsible for the horrors of apartheid. Nelson Mandela has in effect called a halt to that by his firm stand in refusing the truth commission's appeal for an extension to the amnesty cut- off date. We would support him in that.  Killers cannot be seen as victims.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The classroom's sea of faces wear expressions ranging from lively interest and bewilderment to boredom and incomprehension. Yet for most of these youngsters at a centre for ex- combatants, grappling with basic literacy is better than life at the front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed Lamin Junior, aged 16, joined the Sierra Leone army three years ago to avenge the deaths of his parents and four brothers and sisters at the hands of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). &quot;I learnt to enjoy killing; sometimes the sight of blood would give me zeal to go further,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, eventually, I realised I could not get revenge in this way, and decided to go back to school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed is one of 5 000 youngsters who, after the outbreak of civil war in 1991, joined the army or rebel RUF - some were conscripted, some volunteered.  But since Sierra Leone's first democratic elections in almost 30 years ushered in a civilian government in March, ever more of them are keen to stop fighting. A local organisation, Children Associated with the War (CAW), uses radio broadcasts to persuade young fighters to do so. &quot;Demobilisation is mostly on a voluntary basis and children come directly to the project. They are all tired of fighting,&quot; said Father Mick Hickey, one of CAW's founders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We estimate there are at least 4 000 more children ready to demobilise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 125 undergoing counselling and rehabilitation with CAW in Bo, in addition to 155 at its centre in Freetown, the capital. Many have been reunited with their families or fostered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the children arrive here many have behavioural problems, such as fighting, stealing, nightmares and bed-wetting,&quot; said Edward Kommeh, the home administrator in Bo. &quot;During our six-month programme the children receive professional counselling and engage in activities such as football, drama and agriculture, to help them re-experience childhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children also learn basic literacy skills - 75% have never been to school. After six months, most go on to further education or vocational training, such as carpentry, mechanics or tailoring. Some, such as Mohamed, are more ambitious. &quot;I'd like to be a lawyer,&quot; he said. &quot;Then I could avenge my parents' deaths better than by fighting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some children are being prevented from demobilising by their commanders. &quot; The war is about looting and material gain,&quot; said Kommeh. &quot;Children often serve that purpose for fighters, be they army or RUF; some are sent off to dig diamonds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a ceasefire agreed in April by President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and RUF leader Foday Sankoh, the violence continues in various parts of the country.  What began as a small rebel incursion from neighbouring Liberia in 1991 grew into a brutal campaign of terror against civilians, perpetuated by both rebels and renegade soldiers, which has cost an estimated 50 000 lives and forced almost half the country's 4,5-million people to flee their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some children can attest that life in the army is no better than with the RUF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aminata Tommie, aged 15, was captured by rebels last year. After killing her parents, they forced her to do their cooking and laundry. Speaking in a monotone, eyes fixed on the floor, she said she had been recaptured by the army after less than a month and was forced to spend eight more months doing the same kind of slave labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation in the army was just as bad as with the rebels, they treated me roughly, and I was very afraid.&quot; She also suffered repeated sexual abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even after the children are demobilised, it will be hard to persuade communities to take them back because of the atrocities they have committed,&quot; Mr Kommeh said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Fighting spread in eastern Zaire this week with new raids on villages and refugee camps north of Goma, amid growing evidence of a co- ordinated strategy to drive Hutu extremists away from Rwanda's border.  Several dozen people were reported killed and tens of thousands more added to the wave of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest attacks were apparently launched by Zairean Tutsis in revenge for pogroms in which the army and Hutu extremists have killed at least 15 000 Tutsis in the Masisi region, who are known as Banyarwanda, in the past two years and driven many more from their land and homes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean government accuses the Rwandan government of being behind the raids. Kigali denies the charge. But the attacks appear to bear the hallmarks of an organised effort to clear refugee camps which have provided a safe haven for Hutu extremists attacking in Burundi and Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were raids on several villages near Katale at dawn, and an attack on Kibumba refugee camp near Goma in which dozens were believed killed. More than 20 000 people have fled. To the south, there was fighting around Uvira as the United Nations was finally able to evacuate 48 aid workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations refugee agency was still trying to discover the whereabouts of 150 000 Hutu refugees from Rwanda and Burundi who fled sites near Uvira at the weekend after raids on at least two of the camps. Only a fraction of the refugees have arrived at United Nations centres near Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting erupted after Zairean Tutsis living in the Uvira area resisted attempts to drive them from their land and force them into Rwanda. The authorities accused them of being rebels and threatened extermination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in recent days the resistance has appeared more co-ordinated, with raids on Hutu refugee camps and the Zairean army. Attacks on the Banyamulenge have also galvanised the Banyarwanda into resisting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire's soldiers - notoriously more interested in looting than fighting - are faring poorly in the face of the attacks. Ammunition and equipment are in short supply. Dejected troops are fleeing with the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire's prime minister, Kengo wa Dondo, has accused Rwanda of invading his country. There have been no credible witness accounts of Rwandan soldiers on Zairean soil, but few in the region doubt there is a link between the raids and Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Banyamulenge who joined the largely Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front when it launched its rebel war six years ago have since returned to Zaire and are helping to co-ordinate the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor of the north-western Burundi region of Cibitoke was killed in an ambush on Tuesday by suspected Hutu rebels, a military spokesman told Reuters. Lieutenant-Colonel Marcel Senarenze was travelling with several others. It was not clear how many died.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Once again the sight of Hutu refugees forlornly tramping from conflict in central Africa is tugging at the world's heartstrings. It is a spectacle which has popped up on television screens periodically since the great exodus from Rwanda two-and-a- half years ago. And the United Nations is once again there to ensure that it can generate publicity - and therefore money - from a seemingly endless tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to focus on the plight of the refugees is to hijack the world's attention from the real tragedy now taking place in central Africa. Refugees from Burundi deserve more sympathy given the continuing conflict there. But Rwanda's exiled Hutus are not perpetual victims of war. They are the ones perpetuating the conflict. And much of the world - through the United Nations - has helped them do it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighting now spreading across eastern Zaire is a direct result of the international community's strange perception that the desire of Rwandan Hutu refugees to remain refugees is of overriding importance. It began with the 1994 exodus from Rwanda, as Hutus bolted from the consequences of the murder of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two million people fleeing their country could not be ignored, and the generous international response was right - if made for the wrong reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governments poured in aid to assuage consciences for turning their backs on the genocide of Tutsis. Ordinary people in the West gave because of the tragic television pictures, amid some confusion about whom they were looking at. After visiting the refugees, Tipper Gore, the wife of the United States vice president, described her grief at meeting the survivors of the genocide.  Others were similarly confused, and the idea of the Hutu refugees as the principal victims stuck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain and its allies throw 1 million British pounds a day into the black hole of the camps so that they can claim to help central Africa, while turning their backs on the difficult choices required to find a solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camps are by no means full of guilty people, and conditions in Rwanda are not ideal for returning Hutus. There are reprisal killings, sometimes by the mainly Tutsi army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that is, in part, a result of the continued cross-border raids into Rwanda from the camps, in order to kill, maim and keep the divisions wide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As others have pointed out, the West kept the Khmer Rouge alive in the Cambodian refugee camps in Thailand. Now we are sustaining the genocidal dogma in the Rwandan camps in Zaire and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the United Nations appeals to &quot;all sides to avoid a humanitarian disaster&quot; - referring to Hutu refugees - the real victims of the killing in eastern Zaire are the hundreds of thousands of Tutsis who have lived there for generations but now find themselves facing murder or expulsion. The United Nations says that it cannot help them, because the victims are being killed inside their own country - even if that country has disowned them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spread of fighting into Zaire has been on the cards for months. The Hutu militias, when not raiding Rwanda, consorted with Zairean soldiers and civilians to destroy the country's Tutsis - the Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda denies any hand in helping them fight back, but support for Zairean Tutsis is an effective way to carry the war into the extremists' camp. Under the circumstances, it will be hard for anyone in the West to say that Rwanda is wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington certainly would not permit similar armed camps of fanatics, intent on overthrowing the government, to sit across its border with Mexico.  And the United States invaded Panama and Grenada on far more spurious threats to its security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West keeps talking about closing the camps. Washington - describing them as centres of terrorism - says they should be shut. Two weeks ago, a United Nations conference said the same thing, for the sixth time in two years. Even Zaire's prime minister says the camps must close. And yet, even allowing for the trickle of refugees going home, the numbers in the camps expand with every birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What little attention has been paid to finding a lasting solution in central Africa is suspect or shunned. The United States Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, popped up in the region a fortnight ago pushing a plan for a Western-funded, African- manned peacekeeping force. European support is crucial. It got buried in a spat between the French and Christopher over who has the right to exercise what influence in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if anyone doubts the West's seriousness, it can always point to the great help given to the Hutu refugees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The little girl's head was jerked back, seeming to stare longingly up the hill toward those who had fled without her. In the town below, young thugs pranced through the streets celebrating her brutal death.  One of them had skewered the child through the throat as they hunted down people who had once been their neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fetid overflow of Rwanda's genocide and Burundi's civil war is fuelling a new upsurge of ethnic persecution and fighting in eastern Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of thousands of Zaire's native Tutsis have taken to the hills to escape their government's threat to expel or exterminate them, which has already resulted in hundreds of deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile almost 250 000 Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees in Zaire abandoned their 12 camps around Uvira as Tutsis retaliated with raids. They were apparently made with the encouragement of the Rwandan government, which is keen to strike against extremist Hutu militias sheltering in the camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agency sources reported that unidentified fighters had entered Zaire from Rwanda on Monday night and attacked government army positions close to Rwandan Hutu refugee camps in the eastern town of Goma. The United Nations said it had started to evacuate humanitarian staff from eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Stromberg, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Rwanda, said 221 000 refugees were on the move towards Bukavu, but other aid sources said that with Bukavu cut off, fighting in Uvira and general insecurity in neighbouring Cibitoke, the refugees were heading for Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid sources said heavy fighting was continuing in and around Uvira on Monday, adding that between 4 000 and 5 000 Zaireans had moved into the town from the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The principal victims of the latest pogroms are about 300 000 Tutsis, known as Banyamulenge, who have lived in Zaire for generations. Hostility has swelled since the end of the Rwandan war in 1994 sent more than one million Hutus fleeing into Zaire. But unlike the Tutsi victims of Rwanda's genocide, or similar persecution further north in Zaire, the Banyamulenge are fighting back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them is Moses Kinde, who helps guard his and 12 other families with a machete and an AK47 gun. About 100 people in all, they have settled on the edge of small woods in the hills north of Uvira, a squalid border town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know where Zaire learned to persecute us,&quot; he said. &quot;We had problems before, but when the Rwandan Hutus arrived after that it was clear we were going to have a lot of problems. It got more and more dangerous until the government tried to take our land and they told us we had to leave the country and go back to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we don't come from Rwanda and they cannot force us to go because we know how to fight and the army does not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the violence is near Uvira. It has long had an air of menace, but the mobs of young men parading through the streets waving machetes, metal bars and wooden stakes are new. They believe they are invincible, magically shielded by the twigs and leaves sprouting from their pockets and headbands.  Small children run alongside giving the war dance a sense of carnival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent weeks they have beaten, stoned or carved up people who until recently were their neighbours. Other Banyamulenge disappear into Zaire's notorious jails, emerging only for burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uvira's district commissioner, Shweka Mutabazi, drew up a list of all Banyamulenge property and land, ordered Tutsis to stop building homes, and told soldiers they could take over the houses of those forced to flee. Some people were simply thrown out. Others were beaten up, falsely accused of crimes and imprisoned, or dismissed from their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moses Kinde was forewarned. &quot;A friend of mine knew what was going on, what the authorities were planning. It was just like Rwanda. Men came to the house and told me we had to leave but I couldn't take anything. Some were saying they should kill me. We went to a friend's house but they came again and said I had to go back to Rwanda. I've never been to Rwanda. Then they were killing people and we came up here,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The region's deputy governor, Lwasi Ngabo Lwabanji, sent a new wave of terror through the Banyamulenge three weeks ago when he gave them seven days to get out of Zaire or agree to be placed in camps. &quot;For those of them who defy the order and stay in the hills they will be treated as rebels, and like rebels in other countries will be exterminated and expelled,&quot; Lwabanji said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of soldiers have been flown into the region. They snatch the first transport to hand - sometimes aid agency vehicles - to load up with grenade launchers, machine-guns and boxes of ammunition. But Zairean troops are often drunk and too frightened to take on the armed Banyamulenge so they lob mortars indiscriminately into the hills or hunt down women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young Banyamulenge men have struck back, on occasions sending army units fleeing and hitting refugee camps which shelter Hutu militiamen. Banyamulenge rebels were blamed for two massacres at missionary hospitals in which about 50 people were killed three weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the government portrays them as outsiders, Tutsis first arrived in what is now Zaire some time after the 16th century. They established their settlement in the Mulenge hills and became known as the Banyamulenge. Later they fanned out to Uvira and outlying villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge, often more prosperous than their neighbours, fell victim to President Mobutu's divide-and-rule politics in 1981. A new law stripped them of citizenship, and with it rendered them stateless. By the time more than one million Hutu refugees fled Rwanda in 1994, on the heels of a similar outpouring from Burundi six months earlier, Zaire's Tutsi population was more vulnerable than it had ever been.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A showdown is looming between the book publishing industry and the Department of National Education over proposals for greater state involvement in producing learning materials for schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bodies representing publishers, printers, paper manufacturers and booksellers met last week to discuss what they see as the threat of state publishing and its implications for the industry, including possible job losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At issue is the production of learning materials - teacher guides and worksheets as well as textbooks - for the new school curriculum, to be phased in over four years starting in January 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Education Deputy Director General Dr Ihron Rensburg, in charge of curriculum management, has dismissed the industry's anxiety as &quot;unnecessary&quot;, saying no policy decisions had yet been taken and that textbooks would remain central among materials used in schools, the industry is taking the threat seriously.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The threat originates with some senior provincial curriculum planners who appear to believe that the state's intervention is required if the new 1998 syllabus implementation deadline is to be achieved,&quot; said Publishers' Association of South Africa (Pasa) chairperson Kate McCallum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publishers had committed themselves to having materials ready and available in time, she said. But with 15 months to go to implementation, there were no new curricula based on the new outcomes-based education system, no mechanisms in place for training teachers, and no clear policy statements regarding the provision of books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rensburg is on record as saying the relationship between publishers, the state and schools would have to undergo a major review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new curriculum marks a major shift from rote-learning to outcomes-based education. Rensburg said this demanded a range of learning materials, rather than textbooks only, and aimed at &quot;empowering educators&quot; to play a key role in developing curricula and learning materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new approach meant the old system of publishers employing writers to draft texts could not continue. Rensburg said he had told publishers this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the same time, I have made clear the need for a co-operative and collaborative approach with publishers. We have had a number of meetings with them, developing strategies for dealing with the pace of implementation. I am keen that as far as possible differences between us will be overcome but at the end of the day, we've got a job to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCallum said publishers raised concerns about the scale and pace for implementing the new curriculum with the department seven months ago.  Publishers, paper suppliers, printers and booksellers all needed advance warning to plan for providing extra numbers of textbooks in the shortened supply-and- delivery period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While committed to working with education departments to implement educational reform, publishers legs were &quot;being chopped off at the knees in the process&quot;, said McCallum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In pointing out problems, publishers had been accused of not co-operating and were told that if they were unable or unwilling to provide books in January 1998, then education departments would do so themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCallum said if learning materials were largely produced by the state, long-term consequences for the book-publishing industry would include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* loss of income for the country's estimated 9 000 educational authors;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* fewer new books published as publishers would not be able to cross- subsidise less- lucrative areas;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* loss of skills; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a decline in business for printers, booksellers and other industry sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ultimate decision about what learning materials get used in schools lies with provincial education departments who will have to foot the bill.  The job of the National Education Department is to set norms and standards, which will be secured through the new curriculum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Materials policy was to be discussed this week between national and provincial education department officials. Rensburg told the Mail &amp; Guardian he hoped a &quot;collaborative approach&quot; would result in a &quot;common co- ordinated policy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G has established that while some provincial education departments favour producing learning materials themselves, others are opposed on grounds that they do not have the capacity to perform the task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Head of curriculum development in the Free State Frank Rumboll stressed that no decisions had been taken, but said what was being discussed was making learning more dynamic with dwindling financial resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a source involved in textbook development said while internally produced materials worked in countries such as Scotland and Holland, teachers there were highly trained and motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a country where the education system is failing to a large extent because of the quality of teachers it would be a recipe for disaster to ask them to produce materials themselves,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rensburg would not be drawn on the projected cost of internally produced materials, but said it would be &quot;fairly dramatic&quot;. National policy on the new curriculum and a resourcing strategy would be announced in late November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said about R1,1-billion would have to be spent on introducing new textbooks in 1998 for grades one (six books), four (10 books), and seven (14 books).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Nearly 17 000 state school teachers have applied for voluntary retrenchment, most of them senior experienced staff disenchanted with government's education shake-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 13 000 of the voluntary severance applications come from teachers in Gauteng (severance requests from 9% of its teachers), the Western Cape (requests from 17% of its teachers) and KwaZulu-Natal. The requests have to be approved or blocked by the provinces' education departments by year-end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures are the first the national education department has received from the provinces since teacher redeployment and cutbacks started earlier this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The staff shake up is central to government's drive to redress past imbalances in education funding - proposals agreed by the Education Ministry and teacher unions in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department officials say the numbers suggest few teachers are accepting redeployment. But the resignations will allow new posts to be created in areas deemed understaffed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The door has also been left open to re-employ those leaving on temporary contracts, running for up to a year. &quot;We don't want to paint ourselves into a corner,&quot; Roelf du Prees, the department's deputy director general of human resources, says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of the departures has still to be quantified. But Du Preez says an average severance package will be more than R376 000 - most of it paid by the state pension fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The losses are mainly among the older people because (the package) is more viable for them,&quot; Du Preez says. &quot;With the option of redeployment one can expect this kind of reaction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest teachers' union, the National Association of Professional Teachers of South Africa, says the level of retrenchment requests underlines the impracticality of teacher redeployment. Many of those going are setting up in private education. &quot;Redeployment has not been taken to by teachers because it's impractical,&quot; executive director Huw Davies says. &quot;We're disturbed at the loss of a high level of expertise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng, the Western Cape, the Free State and the Northern Cape are trying to marry the severance requests with staff cuts forced by government's drive to equalise teacher/pupil ratios. Staffing requirements mean matching the two is not assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 6 800 of Gauteng's 48 000 teaching posts are to be shed by December 1997 - 3 300 are supposed to go by the end of this year. The Western Cape is expected to shed 12 000 of its 34 200 teachers - 6 000 by the end of next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A task team of education department and state expenditure officials will go to the provinces next month to cost the resignations. The take-up of redeployment offers, and the prospect of creating new posts with the funds freed up by the resignations, will also be assessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davies says it is unlikely new adequately trained teachers can be found to go into understaffed areas, even if such new posts were to be created.  Government has undertaken to cover the cost of severance packages only for the four provinces deemed to have excess staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the cash is being sought from foreign donors. Du Preez says the UK, US, Germany, the European Union and the Republic of China have all shown interest in funding the programme. But it is not clear whether the donors want to fund severance packages or other parts of the education programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng education department chief co- ordinator for right-sizing Dennis Molaba says there is broad support from the province's 1 952 schools for its three-year reshape. There has been opposition from the coloured community, with schools in Eldorado Park refusing to establish committees to draw up right-sizing plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he says it is unlikely reallocating staff resources will be completed by 1998, which could force compulsory retrenchments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Western Cape's education and cultural affairs MEC, Martha Olckers, says many of the voluntary severance applicants applied &quot;because they don't want to be redeployed somewhere haywire.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Nelson Mandela's pledge to uncover the &quot;truth&quot; of the 1986 Samora Machel air crash highlights the unsatisfactory outcome of the Margo Commission of Inquiry which blamed the tragedy on pilot error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquiry was flawed by the refusal of the Mozambican and Russian governments to exercise their right of representation as well as blocking the appearance of apparently key witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Cecil Margo was left to construct an explanation in collaboration with the South African authorities. The judge, a former pilot, is highly regarded; he had the assistance of experienced fellow commissioners and there has been no suggestion that they were involved in any sort of cover-up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the way in which the South African security forces and the National Party government duped Judge Louis Harms's hit squad inquiry points to the ease with which commissions can be fooled by those with state resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central question facing the commission was why the aircraft made a turn at 19 167 feet which sent it hurtling into a South African hill-side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambique and Russia, although they failed to appear at the inquiry, publicly blamed a &quot;decoy&quot; radio beacon which interfered with the legitimate beacon at Maputo and lured the aircraft into the wrong trajectory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the decoy beacon would have needed about twice the power of the Maputo transmitter and - requiring a three-ton lorry to carry the equipment, which would have included an antenna 15ft high and 15ft wide - would probably have been seen on the ground. Another aircraft which was in the air at the time was not similarly affected. And the competing transmitters would have sent the plane on a curved, rather than straight path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the explanation provided by the South African aviation authorities also appeared full of holes. The hypothesis can be summed up as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plane was flying with the help of a navigational ground beacon at Maputo. At a critical stage, said the South African experts, the co-pilot may have switched to an alternate beacon in Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that precise moment, the navigator may have fed a bearing into the navigation system on the assumption that it was locked into the Maputo beacon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because they were in fact locked into Swaziland, rather than Maputo, the bearing caused them to turn right instead of left. The co-pilot then switched back to the Maputo beacon (this has to be assumed, because the instrument was found, after the crash, to have been tuned into Maputo).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the nature of such a hypothesis that it can be destroyed by a single flaw. And there are aspects of evidence which might have provided fruitful grounds for challenge to this one, with the sort of rigorous cross- examination which might have been expected from Soviet or Mozambican lawyers - backed up by expert advisors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the investigators knew that the fatal turn was based on a radio beacon reading, because the cockpit voice recorder has the captain questioning the turn and the navigator replying: &quot;VOR indicates that way&quot; - VOR being the type of beacon. But it is difficult to understand why the co- pilot - in control of the aircraft at that stage - did not pick up the exchange and make the point that he had been tuned into the Swazi beacon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This might be explained by inattention on the co-pilot's part (there is evidence that he may have been listening to a Russian broadcasting station with half an ear at the time). But there is a further objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be assumed that the co-pilot's (supposed) cross-check on the Swazi beacon would have been swift. But there is a course indicator dial in front of the navigator. And the moment the co-pilot switched back to Maputo (after the turn), the needle on the navigator's dial would have swung to the left, warning him he was off course. But in the 10 minutes between the turn and impact the navigator failed to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses suggested that the navigator might have seen this swing on his dial, when he (the navigator) later made a cryptic comment: &quot;There is something I don't understand ahh ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even that comment was made a full four minutes before the crash. And it is extremely difficult to understand why - at a time when there was total confusion among the crew as to where they were - the man responsible for establishing their position failed, for four minutes, to either act, or to point out to his colleagues that the instrument was telling them they were way off course.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Whatever the cause of the Samora Machel air crash, there is one scandal involving the actions of the South African authorities which has not been fully exposed - relating to Mozambique state documents on board the aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A little more than a week after the crash a diplomatic row blew up with allegations by South Africa that Mozambique and Zimbabwe had been plotting to overthrow the Banda government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claims were based on the minutes of a meeting in Maputo three days before the crash. They recorded a meeting between Machel and the commander in chief of the Zimbabwe armed forces, General Rex Nhongo. The then foreign minister, Pik Botha, said the minutes of the meeting had been found in the aircraft wreckage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In evidence to the Margo inquiry, a senior official in the South African Department of Foreign Affairs, Neil van Heerden, said that when he arrived on the scene of the disaster &quot;things were strewn all over and appeared to be in the original positions in which they landed at the crash&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently - as Van Heerden related it - a strong wind blew up. A Mozambican Cabinet minister at the scene, Colonel Sergio Viera, had said the scattered documents appeared to be Machel's personal papers and state documents. He had asked Pik Botha if they (the Mozambicans) could remove them before they blew away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botha, after consultation with the South African commissioner of police, had agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Heerden went on to say that the commissioner of police had added &quot;that these documents had been photocopied for the purpose of the further investigation and therefore the original documents could be handed back&quot;. The point was not explored further by the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This evidence supports an interview carried by the Mozambican news agency, AIM, on October 27 1986 with a survivor of the crash. The survivor complained that police who were first to arrive on the scene ignored the injured and instead concentrated on collecting and taking away documents, including two diplomatic bags.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action by the police would appear to have been a breach of aviation legislation prohibiting any disturbance of an accident site without permission of an official investigating team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also seems to have been a breach of diplomatic immunity which provides for the complete inviolability of a foreign head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A more serious issue is raised, however. The crash took place in a remote area. To have copied the documents the police at the scene would have had to bundle them into a vehicle and drive them to Komatipoort, the nearest town with a photostat machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Van Heerden's insistence that the documents in question were strewn around the ground implies that the police brought them back to the crash site and re-distributed them on the ground - a conspiracy to mislead. It also raises questions as to whether there was any other tampering with the wreckage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Former foreign minister Pik Botha says re-opening the Samora Machel crash inquiry may be the only way &quot;to clear up lingering doubts&quot; about the circumstances in which the Mozambique president died 10 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His call follows an emotional ceremony at the site of the crash last week when President Nelson Mandela, watching a tearful Gra</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a Machel lay a wreath in memory of her husband, vowed to uncover the truth about the disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Certainty about the precise chain of events which robbed Africa of one of her greatest leaders still eludes us,&quot; said Mandela. &quot;There are unanswered questions along the journey that led to the loss of more than 30 lives on this hillside. And we shall leave no stone unturned to ensure that, in the fullness of time, nothing but the whole truth is known about these events.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botha, who was centrally involved in events of the time said: &quot;I can understand there are lingering doubts, suspicions. Let's investigate them. I am fairly convinced we did everything we could, that the inquiry was properly done ... for example, we sent the voice recorder for analysis to a European country, and it was my task to see that a clinical, fair investigation was conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps only (a new investigation) will allay those suspicions. I have learned recently that anything is possible. I have learned (through revelations at the trial of Eugene de Kock) that we were deceived and that we took some decisions on the basis of false information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Cecil Margo, who headed up the official inquiry, said it would be possible to reopen the investigation, but only if new evidence was produced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the technical investigations had been through and that the recovery of the flight recorder and cockpit recordings had given them all the material necessary for their conclusions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He emphatically denied that he could have been a victim of a security force cover-up or conspiracy. &quot;That's ridiculous, we had the flight recorder right in front of us,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Aviation Authority chief director Rennie van Zyl told the M&amp;G that there is no new evidence about the crash to dig up. He said the tripartite technical team (consisting of South African, Mozambican and Russian investigators) did an &quot;exceptional job as far as the factual basis was concerned&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was nothing unexplored. It was a pure operations and human-related accident,&quot; he said, laying the blame squarely with the &quot;incompetent&quot; Russian aircrew.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is difficult to believe Frikkie Cloete when he points across a bleak mielie field in the middle of Mpumalanga and says &quot;all this is oil - for 6km that way&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Cloete, manager of the Strategic Fuel Fund's mammoth underground oil storage facility at Ogies, about 100km east of Johannesburg, is not bluffing.  Beneath the rows of mielie husks in the disused Klippoortjie coal mine are millions of barrels of oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oil covers an area roughly the size of the Knysna lagoon, but the only things that give away its presence are unexceptional, shiny metal turrets which, to the agriculturally ignorant, could be mistaken for fancy watering devices. The turrets, one of which is just a few metres from the road linking Ogies and Bethal, are there to allow natural gas to escape from the oil stash below.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klippoortjie is one of four mines in the Ogies area bought by the apartheid government from 1967 onwards and converted into the world's largest oil storage operation. It is a project which stands as a brilliant exposition of the saying &quot;n Boer maak 'n plan&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operation - at which Cloete, who endearingly refers to himself as the &quot; Shah of Ogies&quot;, has worked since its inception - was the lynchpin of the &quot; total onslaught&quot; oil strategy. With its better-known sister tanks at Saldanha Bay, north of Cape Town, South Africa had an 18-month supply of oil that boycott-busting businessmen helped navigate through the sanctions maze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Saldanha tanks, which cover an area equivalent to 48 rugby pitches, can house about half the oil Ogies can. While they cost about R110-million to build in 1987, the Ogies operation, which costs the government just under R1- million a year to run, came much cheaper. It was literally a case of pouring oil down four old mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notion that the government had an oil stash down a mine was one of the more exotic urban legends that circulated during the apartheid years. But it never graduated from urban legend status thanks to tight security legislation that accompanied government oil procurement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although, since the secrecy legislation was removed two years ago, the lid has been lifted on Ogies , the staggering scale and nature of the operations are largely unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its heyday the Ogies mines housed 118- million barrels of oil - enough to keep South Africa moving for a year. The enormous reserves are linked by a pipeline to a fenced-in building on a dirt road just outside Ogies, the nerve centre of the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security at this four-room building and at the three mines themselves is surprisingly low-key. There is no surveillance equipment to monitor ambitious cadres inserting matches down the gas escape turrets above each of the mines - only high, unelectrified fences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most striking reminders of the paranoia that sustained apartheid fuel policies are the bulletproof glass windows of the control room at the back of the main building. The windows do actually have bullet craters in them. But they are on the inside, serving not as a reminder of a battle between Umkhonto weSizwe cadres and defenders of apartheid's total onslaught oil policies, but rather of a technician's efforts to relieve the boredom of a lazy afternoon by firing at the glass from his swivel chair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from a personal computer in the control room the entire operation is notably antiquated and spotlessly clean. Cloete proudly presented a stack of accountants' books which showed when each oil stash had been poured in - right back to the first entry in 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pieter Coetzee, a deputy general manager at the Strategic Fuel Fund (SFF) who monitors Ogies and Saldanha, worked on one of the mines in the area until 1990. He used to drive past the control centre every day. He said that as late as 1989 he had no idea of the building's function or that most of the roads leading from Ogies ran over South Africa's only oil fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone who worked there had to have top- level security clearance and the only civilians let in on the secret were the farmers who agreed to give the SFF access over their land to the holes into which oil was poured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloete explains that the oil was poured straight into the mines after being piped up from Durban. The first three mines, Alpha, Beta, and Ogies were disused. Thirty kilometres away, Klippoortjie, the fourth and largest, was still operating when SFF bought it from Transnatal, the coal mining company that is now part of mining giant Gencor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the oil is kept within the mine walls by the water in the earth, which means the only requirement for an oil-bearing mine is an adequate water table. Cloete says the United States pioneered the idea when they stored oil in salt mines. Contractors from the United States, which led the oil boycott against South Africa, helped set up the Ogies operation in the late 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloete says the mines were not thoroughly cleared of equipment before the oil was poured in, so there is still some machinery down there coated in crude oil. He insists the environmental impact has been minimal - there has been only a little seepage at Klippoortjie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past few years the SFF has been winding down the Ogies stock and now both Alpha and Beta are almost empty. The last remaining 27-million barrels are all in Klippoortjie, where the stock will be reduced to 10- million barrels over the next year. The oil, most of which is from Iran, will be sold to Natref, an oil refinery in Sasolburg, jointly owned by local synthetic fuel company Sasol and French oil company Total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloete says that because the mine floors are uneven, about 5,5-million barrels of oil remain in Alpha and Beta. He suspects improvements in pumping technology will allow SFF to pump out the oil which will prevent it from becoming a monument to the wastefulness of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the winding down to 10-million barrels - the strategic stockpile recommended by the International Energy Agency - the 41-strong staff at Ogies will be reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The role of the SFF itself has become increasingly controversial with the passing of its sanctions-busting days. Some argue it should be sold off.  Others, like general manager Kobus van Zyl, dismiss such an idea. He says SFF's oil trading operations, that developed parallel to its sanctions busting, can be a valuable cash generator for the government. He has a point - last year the SFF handed a R2-billion cheque to the treasury, R275-million of which was from trading profits, and the rest from the sale of strategic stocks. Cynics, however, ask what would happen if it were to make a loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ogies, the Shah, who is very proud of the immaculate roses which surround his headquarters, appears accepting of his diminishing role. He has a mielie and dairy farm nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is nevertheless impossible not to detect a note of nostalgia in the air as he and his colleagues treat the first journalist ever to visit them to a lunchtime braai.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - One of the most poignant moments in Jacques Pauw's remarkable two-hour television documentary on mass murderer Eugene de Kock was the moment he faced the camera and confronted his own apartheid ghost: the role he played in the murder of human rights lawyer Bheki Mhlangeni .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hardly a day goes by when I'm not haunted by the fact that I did not believe the bomb existed and therefore forgot to pass on a warning, to someone I knew well,'' says Pauw. &quot;I keep thinking that just a five-minute phone call could have prevented it happening.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mhlangeni was killed in 1991 by a parcel bomb sent by De Kock and his Vlakplaas death squad cohorts to their former commander-turned- African National Congress-informer Dirk Coetzee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Pauw neglected to tell his audience was that the ANC had also been warned about the suspected parcel six months previously yet failed to stop it blowing up one of its own. It is as if Pauw wants to find some tangible way of attaching blame to himself for not preventing the brutal repression of black people and their white supporters by the De Kocks and Coetzees of this society.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took Pauw, his cameraman Jan de Klerk (nephew of former state president FW) nine months to track down such infamous De Kock colleagues as assassin Joe Mamasela and convicted murderer and CCB operative Ferdi Bernard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, the day after the second instalment of his two-part tour de force, Pauw looked like a man who has been through the wringer. Looking tired and visibly embarrassed to be in the spotlight, he responds shyly to the chorus of congratulation as he strides through the corridors of the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not for him the pleasure of a job well done. Pauw is a man happiest when involved in an obsession. Exposing the actions of apartheid death squads has been his obsession for seven years and he confesses to a sense of &quot;anti- climax&quot; now that it is all over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pauw's public confession, like his film's exposure of Vlakplaas killing sprees, can be seen in the context of a much broader confrontation in which he comes to terms with his Afrikaner background and bloodletting carried out by security police in its name. It is a double cathartic cleansing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I started looking at death squads in 1989 I had no idea it was so widespread. I thought it was a limited manifestation of police brutality,&quot; says Pauw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within a short time it became clear just how widespread the killings were and that they were state-sponsored. The revelation both shocked and repulsed him. &quot;I could not believe that as South Africans we were so naive to have not known that in a repressive society these kinds of things were bound to happen.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That he feels some guilt for enjoying the fruits of apartheid is clear. &quot;I think people did not know what was going on because they did not want to know.  Very much like what happened under the Nazi government in Germany during the Second World War.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The guilt theme runs like a lit fuse through Pauw's expos . It shows a man trying to come to terms with his history. &quot;It's very important that every white person takes responsibility for the actions of Eugene de Kock because he did it in our name. And many showed their approval by ever-increasing votes for the National Party, for over 40 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born 37 years ago in Pretoria to die-hard Afrikaner parents, Pauw has long since shed the volk and fatherland indoctrination of his childhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His grandmother, who took her first breath in a British concentration camp in 1902, took her passionate hatred of the English to the grave. His father, a headmaster, was a member of the Broederbond and Pauw was brought up steeped in Afrikaner tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he considered himself a liberal during his youth (he was member of the Progressive Federal Party) Pauw never thought of the ANC as anything other than terrorist until he helped found the newspaper Vrye Weekblad in 1988 and revealed the existence of death squads. &quot;I started meeting activists from the United Democratic Front and gradually my eyes were opened to the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to that he considered the ANC an irrelevant evil. &quot;I believed the propaganda that they were communist devils.&quot; He even did his bit for apartheid: first as a conscript in the army, where he worked in the propaganda unit churning out reports about how the South African army was thrashing Renamo; then as a reporter on Rapport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember one particular story when I wrote about the killing of Janette and Katryn Schoon by a parcel bomb sent by Craig Williamson. General Johan Coetzee, who was police commissioner, told me it had been caused by an internal power struggle within the ANC and I wrote a story saying that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in the second edition of Vrye Weekblad that he really began his Damascus journey. Pauw wrote a challenging article about PW Botha lunching a known Italian mafia boss living in South Africa, in a bid for campaign funds.  PW sued for defamation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When my mother saw that the story was leading the television news, she rang me and cried so much she could could hardly speak.&quot; He gently declined her plea for him to use a pseudonym.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although at this time he was still invited to family gatherings, the invitations from cousins, uncles and aunts eventually dried up as he was regarded as having betrayed his people. When his first book was launched in 1991 by Nelson Mandela he invited the entire clan - only his mother turned up.  His father had by then died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pauw does not consider himself an Afrikaner. &quot;I am an Afrikaans-speaking South African. I don't want to be sidelined somewhere in a corner of this great country, but part of the larger nation.&quot; It is all part of the internal struggle which appears to fuel his cultural angst. For while on the one hand he despises, even hates De Kock and his fellow killers, Pauw admits to feeling a certain empathy with them. &quot;I got on well with them,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps I got too close. My wife certainly does not understand how it is that I can have them over at my house for a drink. Maybe it's the language and the shared indoctrinated background?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where his passion shines is his belief that it is the role of former and current National Party leaders to take a lead in purging themselves of their apartheid guilt because it is the only way to close the book on the evils done to uphold the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the state should stop pretending that it never happened. Top politicians like PW Botha and FW de Klerk must come clean about their involvement. They must take responsibility for what was done in the govenment's name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk in particular comes in for much criticism for allowing Vlakplaas to continue operating three years after discovering what it was doing. When the unit was shut down De Kock left the SAP aged 44 with a R1-million goodbye cheque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the risks involved in uncovering these homicidal security police operatives Pauw, who is married with a stepson, says he has never really feared for his life. &quot;These people were nothing more than a bunch of drunken criminals and I decided that they had more important people to take out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that his journey has come to an end Pauw is looking to spread his tentacles wider afield. His next planned project is to do a documentary on the death squads of Chile and Agentina. He would also like to interview FW de Klerk and write another book loosely based on the documentary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for now he simply wants a break from it all. &quot;I hope that what we have done is to show what happened and help to bring about a climate of understanding the reasons why.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma may have a reputation for tilting at windmills, but for once her opponent - the fabulously powerful tobacco lobby - may have met its match. Zuma is backed by a strong body of international opinion and by signs that her anti-smoking measures are paying off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuma is still smarting from a recent defeat by pharmaceutical companies, who threatened court action unless she dropped plans to force the prescription of cheaper generic medicines. Zuma withdrew the &quot;offending&quot; parts of her draft legislation, saying they would be redrafted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But last week she did it again, starting a small war by provoking tobacco magnate Johann Rupert to an unprecedented attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Zuma did was tell the Senate that cigarette companies were flouting her Tobacco Products Control Act regulations on cigarette health warnings.  Zuma named the offenders as the Rembrandt Group, of which Rupert is chair, as well as United Tobacco Company, RJ Reynolds and Imperial Tobacco - and said she was considering a complete ban on tobacco advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuma listed the violations as the importation of cigarettes without the prescribed health warning, advertising on billboards where the health warnings were not visible at night or inadequate, and ads in the print media where the warnings were too small or did not show tar and nicotine content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuma already had the tobacco lobby complaining that their &quot;freedom of speech&quot; was being infringed when she brought out her health warning regulations in December 1994 - warnings which anti-tobacco groups pointed out merely brought South Africa in line with many developed countries. But this time, by threatening to ban tobacco advertising altogether, she made a frontal assault on one of the most powerful interest groups in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tobacco industry is reportedly worth more than R6-billion to the South African economy and supports about 200 000 South Africans. The National Council Against Smoking (NCAS) says R150-million is spent annually on tobacco advertising. The South African Revenue Service estimates government coffers will be swelled by about R1,16-billion by excise duties on locally manufactured tobacco products alone in the current financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rembrandt Group last year ranked eighth on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) in terms of market capitalisation, while its Swiss-registered sibling Richemont ranked fourth on the JSE (after Anglo American, De Beers and South African Breweries). Both are controlled by the Rupert/Hertzog dynasty, headed by Rembrandt founder Anton Rupert - one of the select group of businessmen who serve on President Nelson Mandela's &quot;Brenthurst&quot; advisory group. Richemont boasted a R28,7-billion capitalisation last year (Rembrandt R18,3-billion) and a pre-tax profit of R4,6-billion (Rembrandt R1,4- billion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stockbroking analyst Carel Oosthuyzen was quoted this week as saying Rembrandt/Richemont tobacco associate, the Rothmans Group, generated R35- billion in excise duties worldwide. &quot;This is roughly 25% of this country's Budget. If you were to cut this figure out of certain countries' budgets, it could add as much as 1% to their deficit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was not surprising that Rupert went on the counter-offensive with a full-page open letter to Zuma in the Sunday press, saying: &quot;It is ironic and a sad fact of our society that a company which dutifully pays its taxes, and goes out of its way to comply with the letter and spirit of the law, is now being accused by you of breaking the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rupert said Zuma had been warned often that cigarette smuggling would increase as a result of increased excise duties. He went on to say that in 1993, &quot;in a law-abiding country like Canada, smuggled cigarettes increased to over 40% of the total market. As in South Africa, this was due to high levels of excise duties. The Canadian government lost tax revenues and, due to the availability of cheaper smuggled products, consumption did not decrease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, however, a considerable body of evidence which appears to contradict much of what Rupert said - and which appears to support Zuma's argument that the best way to decrease smoking is to discourage new smokers, especially teenagers, by banning advertising and further increasing excise taxes on tobacco products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 22 Western countries have complete or near-complete advertising bans, in line with a May 1990 World Health Organisation resolution. And South Africa, in spite of increases in excise and import duties in recent years, still levies lower taxes than most. South Africa's 1995 cigarette excise of 38% of retail value compares unfavourably with, for example, Zimbabwe's 50%, the United Kingdom's 76%, Denmark's 85% and Brazil's 74%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And government statistics appear to make nonsense of Rupert's argument that higher taxes will lead to more smuggling to the extent that state coffers will suffer and smoking will increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a retaliatory open letter written this week to Rupert, the NCAS pointed out that in the first nine months of 1995, compared to the same period in 1994, wholesale cigarette sales dropped by 2,2%, while cigarette tax revenues increased by 32,5% - from about R825-million to about R1,09-billion, according to Department of Finance figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NCAS says in the letter: &quot;Yes, cigarette smuggling has increased in South Africa, as has smuggling of televisions, hi-fi sets, drugs, tyres and other products. Decreasing the excise tax on cigarettes will not end smuggling. The smugglers will simply switch from tobacco to other goods.  Lowering tobacco taxes will, however, result in a loss of government revenue, and a rise in tobacco industry sales and profits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British Medical Journal in May agreed that cigarette smuggling into Canada increased with increased taxes, but said total consumption (including of smuggled cigarettes) decreased by 40% between 1982 to 1991 as taxes increased. When the taxes were lowered again in February 1994 to curb smuggling, smoking increased immediately and tobacco tax revenues dropped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Rupert said Rembrandt had gone &quot;out of its way to comply with the letter and the spirit of the law&quot;, there is little doubt that the law on health warnings in advertising is often breached. The Mail &amp; Guardian this week photographed a Chesterfield (one of Rupert's brands) billboard advertisement in Johannesburg where the warning is not lit up at night, while the &quot;Chesterfield&quot; neon lettering is clearly visible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Health supplied the M&amp;G with details of a number of cases which have been reported to police by individuals. These included complaints about breaches of the law on billboards, in print media and in point- of-sale advertising material. A Cape Town state prosecutor this week said she had knowledge of a number of cases where offenders had paid admission of guilt fines before it came to trial. She said offenders could also still get off with warnings, as the rules were &quot;relatively new&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Free State Premier Terror Lekota this week said he would deal with disciplinary charges to be brought against him by a hostile provincial African National Congress leadership &quot;when they came&quot; and defended comments he made on a radio broadcast as the political row in the province escalated to a new intensity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lekota also refuted claims that he was soft- pedalling on corruption allegations levied against his MEC for agriculture, Cas Human, involving a company called Agri-Eco, and Lekota's alleged involvement in the transfer of state land to a Chinese businessman, Van Chen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC secretary general Cyril Ramaphosa has meanwhile appealed to members of the party's provincial executive committee to refrain from any actions that could damage the ANC's image and has urged them to try and solve the problems amicably.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it became clear this week that the fragile truce brokered by ANC national leaders in July had shattered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial ANC leader Pat Matosa told the Mail &amp; Guardian Lekota would be formally informed of disciplinary charges &quot;today or tomorrow&quot;. Still to be finalised, they would involve Lekota's allegedly bringing the ANC into disrepute, publicly vilifying ANC Free State leaders and dividing the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matosa alleged Lekota had violated agreements brokered in the so-called Cape Town accord when a team of national leaders, led by ANC trouble-shooter, Minister of Sport Steve Tshwete, tried to resolve hostilities between Lekota and ANC provincial leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What sparked the breakdown was that the premier violated the accord by travelling to areas and vilifying ANC Free State leaders. That we could tolerate as it was just in those areas, but the broadcast on Lesedi Stereo was the last straw,&quot; Matosa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lekota had described him during the programme as &quot;a gun-toting thug&quot;; had claimed that Vax Mayekiso, a member of the provincial legislature and former MEC for Housing, was given R2-million by the National Party government &quot;when it was still killing people&quot; and that Ace Magashule &quot;was party to officials who had squandered R7-million&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lekota fired Magashule as MEC for economic affairs and tourism in June for &quot; insubordination&quot;, but was later forced to reinstate him as MEC for transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, corruption charges were being investigated against Magashule for establishing two Section 21 companies without authority and depositing millions of government funds in their accounts. Lekota's supporters condemned the ANC leadership for what they saw as an attempted cover-up of potentially embarrassing corruption charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matosa said the provincial executive committee had called for an ANC commission of inquiry into allegations of corruption and missing government money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would cover Lekota's alleged involvement in the land transfer to Van Chen and his alleged failure to act against Human who had R19,5-million of government funds in the account of a private company, Agri-Eco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lekota said that unlike Magashule, Human had followed proper procedures and consulted with Cabinet in depositing funds in Agri-Eco as a way of dealing with unbundling the former parastatal Agricor. The ANC caucus in the legislature decided yesterday it was unnecessary for Human to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Land Affairs Derek Hanekom had approved the transfer of land to the Phuthaditjaba Transitional Council and questions about its disposal to Van Chen - whom he freely admitted was a personal friend - should be directed to the council. &quot;Is it being said I told the council to give the land to Van Chen? No. I reject this insinuation,&quot; Lekota said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - After five years of negotiating and 11 months after a deal was struck, actors are still stranded by the South African Broadcasting Corporation's (SABC) failure to sign a contract to protect their rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And SABC officials don't even know where the long-awaited Television Performers Contract is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Head of television Gill Chisholm told the Mail &amp; Guardian in a fax this week that it was in the hands of the corporation's legal division and she could only deal with it when it was returned to her.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a legal department representative said the contract was &quot;most certainly&quot; in Chisholm's hands. &quot;Once she signs it, the wheels will be set in motion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, actors are being forced to work in a discipline infamous for its exploitation of performers without the the most basic form of professional security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Negotiations for a more equitable television performers' contract were started five years ago,&quot; says Japan Nthembu of the Performing Arts Workers' Equity (Pawe). &quot;Representatives from the SABC and Pawe were given a full mandate to draw up a new document. In November 1995 the terms were finalised and submitted to Chisholm to sign as a mere formality. One year later, we are still waiting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amended contract includes clauses concerning actors' hours of labour, safety, transport and the right of actors to a residual fee for programmes that are repeated on the SABC. The clauses were endorsed by the SABC's legal team as well as Pawe's representatives. Signalling a substantial departure from the previous contract which was heavily in favour of the SABC, they would have brought the SABC and its labour practices closer in line with actor employment conditions elsewhere in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the failure to sign the long overdue document has meant that the conditions under which actors are employed and their rates of remuneration - regarded as archaic by world standards - have remained static. And to make matters worse, actors cannot even fall back on the flimsy security of their old performers' contract because it was declared null and void until the signing of the new one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actors are now in a more vulnerable position than ever,&quot; says MoonYeen Lee, one of South Africa's most powerful actors' agents. &quot;This makes the SABC's talk of restructuring and transformation sound patently absurd because it is showing a total disregard for fair labour practices and a glaring inability to put into effect progressive changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She adds: &quot;It's time the SABC bosses stopped examining lunch and parking vouchers in the safety of their offices and confronted the real, pressing issues facing them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Cape Town is fast becoming one of the most expensive tourist destinations in the world with widespread profiteering in its hospitality industry. While South Africa's tourism industry has the potential to generate 10% of the country's income, international goodwill could be ruined by overpricing and poor service, say industry sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reputation of the country's premier destination, Cape Town, sustained a heavy knock recently when a British survey found that accommodation rates had soared well above international standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British consultants Pannell Kerr Foster Associates found that room rates in Cape hotels increased by 20% in the past year. This was the third highest in Africa and the Middle East, with only Kuwait and Tel Aviv increasing prices faster. Other countries increased their hotel rates by 7%.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hong Kong is the most expensive tourist destination in the world, with an average hotel room price of $240 (about R1 080). Cape Town's average price is $126 a night (about R567).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town ranks highly as an international destination. In a recent survey readers of the American glossy magazine Harpers Bazaar placed Cape Town third, behind San Francisco and Vancouver, in the world's top 100 cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city attracts 60% of all foreign tourists to South Africa, with 630 000 expected to visit this year. The weak rand stretches the spending power of foreign visitors and has increased tourist numbers, especially from the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand the decline of the rand affects the ability of South Africans to travel abroad, and domestic visitors to Cape Town are expected to exceed 730 000 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But prices and services draw fire. With four- and five-star hotel rates ranging from about R800 to R1 360 a night for a double room, the accommodation industry has come in for criticism of high prices and poor service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dale Pretorius, of Satour's international section, warns that South Africa could be pricing itself out of the market. European tourists could travel to several other destinations for a fraction of the cost of travelling to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's definitely a danger of killing the golden goose,&quot; he said. &quot;We're no longer the flavour of the month; we're one of 160 destinations competing for the (tourism) traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The South African tourism industry is catering for the business and wealthy brackets, but has missed the boat for the ordinary client. There is a pricing problem, especially with four- and five-star hotels. Some hotels offer dual rates, in dollars and rands, for international and domestic customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't take long for foreign guests to find out they've been taken for a ride.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captour spokesman Jeremy Harris said the organisation had received complaints from tourists who believed they were paying slightly more than they should. Most were from people who had visited Cape Town before and were shocked at price increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captour's concern was that Cape Town was pricing itself out of the market, he said. &quot;We would like the city to be attractive to tourists not only in terms of its natural beauty but affordability as well,&quot; said Harris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Captour's board included representatives of the hotel industry and at a meeting in July they had been asked to justify their prices. They had replied that price increases had been linked to the economy and profits were channelled back in the form of improving services and facilities for foreign tourists and improving staff training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were satisfied with their explanation and felt their initiatives to improve their services were applaudable. At the same time, Captour would like to encourage the industry not only to look at the short-term benefits of tourism,&quot; Harris said. &quot;This should not be seen as a honeymoon phase, the benefits of tourism should last a whole lot longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surveys Captour conducted among tourists departing Cape Town found most were highly satisfied with rates and services offered by tour operators, he said. Day trips to wine farms, Table Mountain and Cape Point ranged from R50 to R140 per person. A personal guide could cost up to R250 a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris agreed that domestic tourists to Cape Town could find that accommodation was priced beyond their reach. He said the city could do more to attract South African visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protea Hotels group managing director, Arthur Gillis, said the R179 a night charged by some of their hotels would probably be too high for a person earning a salary of R2 000 a month, but he doubted people earning those salaries would spend their holiday at a hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our rates have increased by the rate of inflation over the past number of years. We believe that is acceptable in South African terms. How much is too much anyway? We have a free market society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gillis said his advice to domestic tourists was to avoid the peak season in Cape Town, which was between December 20 and January 5. Most hotel groups offered special packages to tourists out of season, such as Protea's seven nights' accommodation and car rental for the price of an airticket from Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have received no complaints about our rates, from foreign or domestic tourists who fill our hotels 12 months a year. We have a reputation to maintain and it would be foolhardy to push our rates up unrealistically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our group is building four new hotels in Cape Town - that should give some idea of the demand for accommodation in the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Service standards have attracted a lot of criticism, said Michael Farr, executive director of the Tourism Business Council, which represents the major players in the industry. &quot;There's no quick fix,&quot; he said, adding that the industry was embarking on effective incentive-driven training to remedy the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Fabricius, chief director of tourism of the Department of Environment Affairs and Tourism, said the tourism industry saw significant growth of 52% from the 1994 elections to late 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourism generated 3% of South Africa's gross national product, compared to a world average of 10%. Crime was affecting Johannesburg which had lost significant market share to Cape Town, although recent violent anti-crime campaigns that had made headline news overseas had also scared some tourists away from the mother city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other industry spokesmen said that, apart from Cape Town, game lodges were also pricing themselves out of the market, with many foreign visitors preferring to pay the fractional extra for a flight to Harare to visit a Zimbabwean game farm instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian and Beulah MacKenzie from Sussex, England, are among the foreign tourists who have enjoyed Cape Town: they chose South Africa to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary. &quot;If your currency wasn't so weak, we'd probably be staying somewhere far less luxurious,&quot; he said. &quot;Our room costs just over 100 a night and we can well afford that for just four nights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we do find a bit steep are the prices at some of your restaurants.  They're similar to what you'd expect in Paris, but the food's nowhere near as good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MacKenzies said they would recommend Cape Town as a holiday destination to their friends and acquaintances. They had experienced bad weather &quot;but the city's far more breathtakingly beautiful than we expected&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the other end of the scale, Australian backpackers Boomer and Mark are paying R30 a night at their Cape Town hostel which is within walking distance of most city highlights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's close to the clubs, and that's all that matters. We went to the Waterfront once in the three weeks we've been here, but there's just shops there man, with way-out prices. I suppose it's okay for people who come here to shop, but we've come to rave. We'll buy our souvenirs on the pavement the day before we leave,&quot; said Boomer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The duo had only one bad experience during their stay. A week ago, after nightclubbing until the early hours of the morning, they decided they would not find their own way home and hailed a taxi. They were charged R60 for a trip they think lasted less than five minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But that was our own fault, we take the blame entirely. If we weren't so drunk, we might have noticed we were being ripped off,&quot; said Boomer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But then, if the taxi driver didn't rip us off, we might have been mugged while we were staggering back to our digs,&quot; said Mark philosophically.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is time the African National Congress provided South Africa with a fresh dose of democracy. It is time to elect a president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the country's impressive start in the democratic tradition, the ideal has been flagging recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The abrupt expulsion of Bantu Holomisa from Parliament has underscored the weakness of the party list as opposed to the constituency system. MPs are more representatives of the party than of the people. It has contributed to the perception that in South Africa the exercise of democracy is limited to national elections. With one party as dominant as the ANC, we are open to the charge that ours is a one-party democracy in which national leadership is in the gift of an individual, or small elite.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The culmination of the US presidential elections and the process - in many ways admirable - by which the most powerful nation on earth chooses its leader offers a lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In little more than a year's time the ANC will be holding its equivalent to an American convention at which a successor to Mandela as party leader will be chosen. In effect he, or she will be their presidential candidate, virtually guaranteed the position as head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The identity of the ANC nominee for the presidency is a foregone conclusion, in the person of Thabo Mbeki. But the process by which he will have gained the nomination is fuzzy. He will no doubt be confirmed on a vote of delegates at next December's party conference. But will that vote be an expression of the will of the present incumbent? Will it be directed by decisions taken at closed meetings of the national executive? What will be the input of grass- roots membership?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it not time the ANC gave South Africa another dose of democracy by following the US example and holding the equivalent of primary elections?  Such an approach may make little difference to the final outcome: Mbeki would remain the front-runner. But it would mean that he demonstrates his popular and party support, giving him much greater legitimacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mandela alone chooses his successor, and Mbeki does likewise when he chooses a deputy, it will leave the distinct impression that the way to the top is not to be popular, or able, but to curry favour with the party hierarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Primary elections would be a powerful antidote to such perceptions. They would force candidates to declare their intentions and spell out their priorities to the public. It would create a public debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And primaries could also introduce a new range of candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women, in particular, should put themselves forward; it is a sad thing that, when the presidential succession is discussed, female candidates are never mentioned. They may not have a hope of winning this time around. But if the likes of Nkosazana Zuma, Frene Ginwala, Cheryl Carolus and Gill Marcus would give it a try, it would provide valuable experience as well as setting an important precedent for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there are other such sections of our society who could follow suit. The churches, for example, have played an important role in the politics of South Africa: perhaps the likes of Archbishop Desmond Tutu could be persuaded to give the religious community a claim on national leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To encourage the sense of local empowerment the primaries should be organised at the provincial level. The provinces could even run their elections by different rules - as in the US where some states allow all residents to vote, while others limit the franchise to party members in good standing. Candidates should go on the election trail, touring the provinces to explain their interpretations of party policies and to articulate their visions for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives within the ANC may argue that it is a formula for division within the party, but we would suggest the contrary: it would be a significant contribution to both party and national unity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Members of the Seventh Day Adventist Church in the Cape are reeling after white members of their church voted this week to retain its racially segregated structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a two-year unity process, the church put to the vote last Sunday a resolution to abolish apartheid in its Cape structures - called conferences - which administer its white, coloured and African congregations. Throughout the rest of the country, the church's racial structures have merged successfully over the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each adventist conference is governed by a separate constitution, and a 75% majority vote was required for a merger. While 94% of its coloured conference voted for a merger, only 69% of white members voted for change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African adventists met on Thursday to deliberate the merger, but their proceedings are futile as unity cannot be achieved unless all three conferences of the church agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church's mission in South Africa began in 1887. In 1929 white and coloured believers were separated into the Cape conference for whites and the Good Hope conference for coloureds. A third, Southern conference, was added for African believers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only were churches racially segregated, but separate schools, welfare organisations and administrative structures were established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Good Hope Conference has been calling for the removal of racial segregation in the Seventh Day Adventist Church and a merger of its structures at every annual meeting since 1970. In 1994, a Cape merger committee was established to negotiate racial unity. It was motivated by Bibilical principles, human rights and the draft constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continued segregation of the church also strained its finances and church employees in white congregations earned higher salaries than employees in black congregations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staffers serving the African congregations indicated during merger talks that they were prepared to continue earning lower salaries during a transition period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lay member of the Cape conference who has advocated a vote against the merger, Dr Bernhard Ficker, denied this week that racism motivated his congregation's vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said while many members of the Cape conference were in favour of a merger, they believed it would lead to &quot;financial chaos&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The merger proposal includes building a new head office for the Cape conference in Port Elizabeth at a cost of R700 000 and people were not prepared to finance this building and pay for the additional staff required,&quot; Ficker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Cape conference voted by a 92% margin in 1992 to merge with the other two conferences on a model they suggested which did not include building a new head office. This model was totally rejected by the other two conferences.  The Southern conference is not prepared to retrench any of its ministers.  They will have to be prepared to cut costs if we are all to come out equally, but they feel the ministry is a calling for life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why the African conference should retrench ministers in a cost- cutting exercise if they were paid lower salaries than ministers in the white conference, Ficker responded that perhaps none of the ministers should be retrenched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ficker said virtually all the churches in the Cape conference were already multiracial, although the majority of congregants were white. The 69% vote in favour of merging indicated that the conference was not racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Adventist Church did allow congregants to organise on racial lines. In the United States, where the church is headquartered, black congregations organised themselves into regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people prefer to worship on the basis of race. Unfortunately, in our country there is the legacy of apartheid and any group seen to be one-sided is labelled racist,&quot; Ficker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In KwaZulu-Natal, where the church has merged, people have divided again on the basis of language. Some people preferred to worship in Afrikaans in Newcastle and formed their own congregation. They are also being called racists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At our high school in Cape Town, black and coloured children worship separately on the campus. The reason for this is that they have a different style. Some people like to clap their hands, others don't. It is natural that different people worship differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Good Hope and Southern conferences are holding us to ransom with a merger proposal which is not financially viable. Unfortunately, they need our vote for a successful merger. Calling us racists is not going to help the process at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Deputy Defence Minister Ronnie Kasrils this week joined in condemning the South African Defence Force's (SADF) submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as &quot;arrogant and disappointing&quot; - but said there was very little the ministry can do to force military generals to reveal more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, commission deputy chair Alex Boraine said if the generals of old failed to provide satisfactory answers to follow-up questions, the truth body would approach Kasrils and Defence Minister Joe Modise to ensure senior officers who served in the SADF and who still serve in the new South African National Defence Force (SANDF) are put under pressure to tell the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major-General Deon Mortimer, former chief of staff logistics, presented the SADF submission to the truth commission on Monday. He said the submission, which attempted to give broad details of apartheid South Africa's security strategy, the SADF's perspective on the &quot;revolutionary war&quot; and defence strategy and operations, was facilitated by the SANDF.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mortimer said the SANDF could take no responsibility for the SADF submission, as the SADF was defunct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boraine immediately dismissed the 81-page submission as &quot;breathtakingly one- sided and almost arrogant in that no responsibility at all was taken for any events. The defence force emerges as the knight on the white horse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasrils this week told the Mail &amp; Guardian he was &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;extremely disappointed, to say the least, at the insensitivity and arrogance of the presentation&quot;. Kasrils said the defence ministry had facilitated the mechanism (a &quot;nodal point&quot; in the SANDF) to secure the co-operation of SADF elements with the truth commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said the ministry, like the SANDF, was a 1994 creation which had neither the knowledge nor the power to force the truth from old SADF personnel. &quot;There is not much we can do except to make the right inputs in the right places.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasrils agreed many senior officers in the SANDF had been inherited from the SADF and former TVBC state forces, but said the ministry had to be &quot; sensitive to the nature of the transition&quot; - a process in which President Mandela had decided to appoint General George Meiring, also a senior officer in the former SADF, as chief of the SANDF - to ensure stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boraine said the submission would be carefully studied. &quot;Where there are omissions and where we think it was not at all balanced, we will contact the head of the SANDF... If we don't get satisfaction there, we will go to Modise and Kasrils and get them to ensure those (personnel whom the SANDF inherited from the SADF) will come forward, although we realise they can't do everything ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General Meiring himself must have some information and knowledge on what happened in the past. It is simply not good enough to say there was a raid and not say there were women, there were children, and that there were never any mistakes - and what about the much more sinister aspects?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boraine pointed out recent testimony by police officers has indicated deep military involvement in organised human rights abuses, and that the Civil Co- operation Bureau, also a military creation, had never been adequately exposed.  &quot;We will certainly be in touch with Meiring ... If we have no satisfaction, we will go to the ministry.&quot; Boraine said subpeonas also remained an option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former police officers Jack Cronj and Roelof Venter this week told the truth commission, during their amnesty applications on multiple counts of murder, that SADF special forces and military intelligence representatives had served on a top-secret committee together with police representatives to select targets for &quot;elimination&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Some city hall staff had to drag in a metal table from the kitchen so that all the lawyers in the house could be properly accommodated.  Long-awaited confessions from five security police officers were held up while a messenger went in search of a machine to photocopy reams of paperwork for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shambolic situation at the start of the truth commission's hastily arranged amnesty hearings in a drab corner of the Johannesburg council building this week prompted cynics in the media room to predict the organisation would falter in its first real effort to extract information from security force officers about their role in past human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then along came the former chief of police, Johan van der Merwe, who made some unexpected admissions about the bombing of Khotso House and booby- trapped handgrenades and suddenly the Truth and Reconciliation Commission lit up with the prospect of a breakthrough, even though it was in a bumbling kind of way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, long after the general made his confession and bolted out of the city hall, some of the sceptics in the press benches were still arguing, and with good cause, that the truth body hadn't come up with anything really dramatic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Merwe, they pointed out, had only admitted to two very specific crimes and he had done this simply because he knew that it was a question of time before some energetic prosecutors in the attorney general's office would force a couple of his men to implicate him in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why, they asked, did members of the amnesty committee not seize the opportunity to grill the general while they had him in the dock and try to squeeze out of him information about a whole range of other massacres and murders that the police have been implicated in, many of them in the early 1990s when Van der Merwe occupied the highest office in the police force?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was it not possible that the former general, a trained lawyer and wily strategist, had stolen a march on the commission by admitting voluntarily to what the commission was bound to hear when the Transvaal Attorney General's next big third force trial starts, and then sliding out of the hearing before the committee had a chance to cross examine him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth of the matter is that this week's hearing for the five police officers seeking amnesty for about 40 murders in the apartheid era was arranged with almost indecent haste by chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu and his deputy, Alex Boraine, because both of them are fairly desperate to show that their organisation is not a toothless organisation where victims come to express public grief while their tormentors stay in the shadows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Word is that the hearings were arranged with the police officers' lawyers even before their applications had been completed and processed by the commission. The commission's investigative unit had been preparing a subpoena for Van der Merwe and a long list of questions to grill him with but in the rush to get the show on the road all this preparatory work was apparently ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some members of the amnesty committee were evidently disgruntled because they were called away suddenly from their task of dealing with hundreds of other amnesty applications so they could take part in this high-profile hearing. They were not briefed or prepared to grab the opportunity the commission has long been waiting for and the consequences may well be worse than a couple of attorneys having to suffer the indignity of sitting at a rickety old kitchen table during the hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutu and Boraine are of the opinion that it is important to have a few high- profile amnesty rulings so that perpetrators can be encouraged to come forward and confess all before the December cut-off date for applicants. If this pressure induces members of the amnesty committee to make an early ruling in favour of the current applicants it will snuff out the attorney general's criminal proceedings against the five and disarm the most potent weapon in the arsenal of the truth process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because, if we look beneath the rosy statements of conciliation suddenly being expressed by the five applicants, it is clear these self-confessed murderers came to the truth body at the 11th hour only because it was their last chance at staving off the prospect of being prosecuted by the same team that hounded Colonel Eugene de Kock to the edge of life sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the rhetoric from their lawyer - &quot;we beg forgiveness ... it is a time of reconciliation ... we have full faith in the commission&quot; - it is patently clear the police strategy is to use the truth commission, and also the undue haste by some of its leading members to hold a high-profile amnesty hearing, in order to undermine and complicate the state's case against the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why their smart young lawyer is demanding that witnesses in the impending criminal case be called to reveal at the truth commission what they are going to say in court. And that is why Van der Merwe nipped in, made only the admissions that were absolutely necessary in the circumstances, and then scarpered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real agents of truth, in this case, are the backroom boys in the Transvaal Attorney General's office hellbent on sending the killers to jail and if this lickety-split hearing ends up quashing their efforts, the commission could end up defeating the ends of justice rather than fulfilling its mission to uncover the grim reality of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luckily for the truth body, though, the process is more complex and unpredictable. A team of six experienced lawyers, each of them representing the families of people who were murdered by the five amnesty applicants, is now sitting at the kitchen table in the city hall. They are armed with the experience required to interrogate these men and force from them details that may otherwise not have been forthcoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amnesty hearings have also already created the first chink in the armour that South African Defence Force officers have thrown around themselves since their victorious non-guilty verdict in the Magnus Malan murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence by Brigadier Jack Cronje, one of the five policemen seeking amnesty in Johannesburg this week, indicates the military was more deeply involved in covert operations than it admitted in its official submission to the truth commission on Monday (see accompanying story).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cronje revealed the existence of a top-secret &quot;counter-revolutionary information target centre&quot;, known as Trewits, which had the job of targeting anti-apartheid activists who needed to be &quot;intimidated or eliminated&quot;.  Military intelligence and the military's special forces had participated in this centre's monthly meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence about the 1986 murder of Dr Fabian Ribeiro and his wife, Florence, due to be given by Warrant Officer Paul van Vuuren, one of the amnesty applicants who participated in the killings, is also likely to show that members of the SADF's Civil Co-operation Bureau were involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the psychological impact of Van der Merwe's admissions this week. Even though he was economical about the dirty tricks in the spectrum that exists between the big bomb at Khotso House and the specific booby- trapped hand grenade attack on the East Rand, the former general's behaviour and announcement that he will apply for amnesty may well encourage more security force officers to come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus it may well be that this was the week in which students of the truth commission will be able to say with hindsight that Boraine - even though he and his colleagues didn't exactly plan it properly - was right when he said the dam wall was about to crack.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Government law advisers are searching for precedents to establish whether PW Botha could face a jail term if he defies a subpoena to testify before the truth commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mandela's office is already bracing itself for a set of civil claims against Botha in the wake of this week's sensational revelations about the former president's role in apartheid-era human rights abuses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shirley Gunn, an anti-apartheid activist accused by then law and order minister Adriaan Vlok of being responsible for the bombing in 1988 of Khotso House, intends including Botha in her claim for damages for libel and wrongful detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's advisers are concerned that the current president's office would be responsible for meeting the payments of damages and costs of any court judgment against Botha or any other previous president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Mandela's legal advisers told the Mail &amp; Guardian his office was investigating whether Botha would be covered by any presidential indemnities for criminal actions which he sanctioned.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our view on the matter from common law and supreme court precedents is that although there are certain indemnities for a president acting in that capacity these do not include immunity from civil claims in regard to criminal acts committed,&quot; the adviser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truth commission deputy chair Alex Boraine would not discount the possibility that Botha - who has in the past made no secret of his contempt for the commission - may be subpoenaed, but said that all other avenues would be explored first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of speculation that Botha was about to respond publicly to this week's testimony by former police commissioner Johan van der Merwe, he maintained his silence at his Wilderness residence, Die Anker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His secretary, Marlene Hartmann, said yesterday: &quot;He has given no comment until today. He is very quiet, he has said nothing yet ... He will react when he is ready.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she said Botha still maintained he had nothing to apologise about. &quot;If one looks at that man Thabo Mbeki, he stood up and said he had thrown bombs, but that he did it for his liberation struggle. In the same way, Mr Botha did what he did for his country, his people and his Lord.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hartmann said Botha was of sound mind and health in spite of his 80-year- old age. &quot;When he dictates letters, he does not even read from a piece of paper, he does it from his head - and he knows his Bible off by heart ... He is a person who looks after himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Merwe and his predecessor as police commissioner, Johan Coetzee, told the M&amp;G this week that they may give the commission further details of state involvement in apartheid misdeeds &quot;as the situation develops&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Merwe on Monday testified to the commision that the bombing of Khotso House had been an order from Adriaan Vlok, who had told him it had come from Botha. Van der Merwe was giving evidence in the amnesty application of five former police officers. Details also emerged of a top-secret state body, Trewits, formed in 1985 to select targets for &quot;elimination&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Merwe told the M&amp;G his mission was not to expose erstwhile colleagues or politicians, but that he would not hide anything. &quot;What it is about is the truth. There is no way that one can testify under oath and not tell the whole truth. Apart from the moral angle, it is also a serious offence ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My men know what I know, and they know I know what they know. If one doesn't tell the truth, people will lose respect for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the politicians, similarly, knew details of the past. &quot;All of them know the truth, and they know others around them know it. For them it is a matter of conscience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether there would be more revelations from his side implicating those above him, Van der Merwe said: &quot;I don't want to expose anyone, as that will mean I'd make myself guilty of despicable behaviour ... But if it comes to the truth, I will not hesitate to talk, no matter who is involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He confirmed he had talked to Botha on Tuesday, the day after he dropped his truth commission bombshell. He said he had told Botha &quot;what it was all about&quot;, and that he would send him a copy of his statement. But he said he did not recommend to Botha to go to the commission. &quot;I'd be the last person to recommend anything to Mr Botha - you know him ... But I have no doubt that a person of his integrity will act according to his conscience.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia's ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) is facing a rebellion around the country where some members aspiring for parliamentary seats have decided to challenge party nominees for the Nov.  18 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels include former Commerce Minister Dipak Patel, who is contesting his former Lusaka central constituency, pitting himself against the party's official candidate, MMD deputy national treasurer Sylvia Masebo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patel had resigned his cabinet portfolio along with former Works and Supply Minister Simon Zukas in protest against the constitutional amendments that bar second-generation Zambians from contesting presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendment has also affected former President Kenneth Kaunda because his parents were from neighboring Malawi. His leading opposition party, UNIP, is boycotting the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another prominent member, Austin Chewe, is challenging MMD deputy national secretary Paul Tembo, for the midlands town of Kabwe constituency. Tembo held the seat in the outgoing parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks ago, Chewe's supporters sparked off a riot at an MMD national rally addressed by President Frederick Chiluba at which he announced names of party candidates for the November elections. They were protesting Chewe's omission from the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's former high commissioner to Zimbabwe, Roger Sakuhuka, on Monday resigned from the ruling party and was expected to stand for his old seat in Zambezi, north-western Zambia, on the ticket of the opposition National Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sakuhuka had served as minister of tourism in Kaunda's last cabinet, voted out of power during the country's first multiparty elections in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Zambia's Lands Minister Peter Machungwa has been declared unopposed for the Luapula parliamentary constituency, in northern Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an announcement in Pretoria on Monday, the EU said the programme -- which is expected to fund about 100 water and sanitation projects during the next two years -- will be aimed at rural areas which do not yet have any such facilities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is part of the Mvula Trust, which is South Africa's largest non- government organisation financing water supply and sanitation projects. The latest EU contribution lifts total aid by the Union to the Mvula Trust beyond the 13 million dollars. It forms part of the EU's total annual contribution of 130 million dollars to South Africa's Reconstruction and Development Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's Ambassador to South Africa, Erwan Fouere, said the programme would concentrate on development of infrastructure. It would also intensify the development of local community involvement in addressing their own needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The empowerment of those communities will ensure a sustainable development process,&quot; he added, &quot;and will enable the people to stand tall with a dignity that was denied them in the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are fleeing to north Kivu. The road to Beni from Bukavu and Goma is not safe. There is too much fighting at home, &quot; the refugees told the paper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thousands are walking, fleeing the war in south Kivu. Others may die on the way,&quot; the refugees said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They told Ugandan security officials in Bushenyi and Kasese border districts that they were going to settle in Beni, Mutwanga and other areas considered to be safe in north Kivu province.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister Ali Asman Mohammed Taha said in an interview carried by the government daily, El Sudan El Hadith, on Tuesday that the government believes such talks could be aborted through intervention of third parties who have influence on SPLA, led by John Garang.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government has no intention at the moment to hold any direct talks with the SPLA because the SPLA is now under pressure from the northern Sudanese opposition represented in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and foreign powers that prevent it to talk independently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taha added that the SPLA was also plagued with internal conflicts that make it unable to come forward for a useful meeting with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further belittled the recent alliance declared between the SPLA and other armed opposition groups belonging to the NDA as &quot;an indication of the failure of the opposition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of the political parties outlawed by Gen. Omar Bashir when he seized power in 1989, the SPLA, and defecting army officers reportedly met in Asmara, Eritrea, last week and unified their armed forces under the command of the SPLA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - Kenya Airways will not pay dividends to shareholders in 1996, in spite of a record operating profit of 2 billion shillings (56 shillings = 1 USD) earned on a turnover of 10 billion shillings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the national carrier's annual report for the year ended March 31 1996, the management, however, hopes to pay shareholders a dividend during the next financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company made an after-tax profit of 1.42 billion shillings compared to the previous year's profit of 2.1 billion shillings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the profit was affected by the settlement of a labor dispute between the airline and its pilots resulting in a payment of 411 million shillings, reflected in the report as an exceptional expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the period under review, the airline paid a tax of 169.6 million shillings compared to nothing the previous year. The earnings per share after taxation and sundry expenditures stood at 3.07 per share compared to the previous year's 4.63 million shillings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenya Airways Chairman, Isaac Omolo Okero, says the year was the most significant in the carrier's history, when the government divested its 51 percent shareholding, and the purchase of a 26-percent stake by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The partnership with KLM will prove to be a good investment due to the experience the latter has in international routes&quot;, Okero said, adding that KLM's investment has brought with it the experience of one of the world's leading airlines. Kenya Airways was already benefitting from joint initiatives designed to improve the quality of service offered to passengers, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Airways Managing Director, Brian Davies, said in the report published last week, that the carrier's current profit margin were among the best in the industry worldwide, when measured against return on capital employed which stood at 25.3 percent or against net margin on sales of 13.8 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first half of 1990s saw airlines recover from the effects of the Gulf War, and by 1994/95, operating benefits were recorded by major international carriers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says the International Air Transport Association forecasts for Sub-Saharan Africa show an annual growth potential of 7 percent over the next five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As one of the few privatized flag carriers in Africa, we are uniquely placed to play a leading role in developing air transport links within the region,&quot; Davies said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The following statement reflects the views of participants from UN agencies and NGOs present at a meeting in Nairobi on 28 and 29 October 1996 which convened in order to agree on actions required in North and South Kivu, Zaire. The UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) called the meeting to review the present crisis and share information on humanitarian strategies, operational plans and constraints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the UN Secretary-General noted in his 24 October letter to the Security Council, the situation in North and South Kivu is already a grave political and humanitarian crisis for both Zaireans and refugee populations in the area, as well as for the stability of the region. During the last week, military activity in border areas has escalated, and an estimated 500,000 people are on the move throughout the Kivu sub-region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major effects of the conflict have been to disperse refugee populations, as well as to displace large numbers of Zaireans from their homes. At present it appears that the majority of refugees are remaining within Zaire, as large return movements to Rwanda and Burundi have not occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certain areas of North and South Kivu are war zones, and conflict and insecurity make the delivery of humanitarian assistance virtually impossible.  Humanitarian personnel seeking to work in the area have been subjected to death threats, have experienced acts of violence against their staff, had their vehicles stolen and property taken. Humanitarian organizations have had no positive responses to their demands for guarantees of security and access to vulnerable populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite these constraints, humanitarian organizations are ready to return to the region as soon as practically possible. The major constraints of lack of security and access must be addressed by discussions with the authorities in Kinshasa as well as local leaders. In order for humanitarian organizations to recommence work in Uvira, negotiations with local leaders will be necessary, while at the national level it must be made clear that these are for the purposes of humanitarian access only, and do not amount to political recognition of any local forces or put into question the territorial integrity of Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may also be necessary to undertake negotiations in areas held by rebel forces to allow safe passage for those refugees seeking to return to their country of origin. Discussions with other regional governments will also be needed to allow aid to be transported to these affected areas in Zaire, when that becomes possible. Humanitarian agencies will do all they can to impartially assist members of all vulnerable groups. Humanitarian organizations will also send the unequivocal message to the international community that a lasting political solution is vital, and will only be achieved once the nationality question, and other underlying issues including the presence of refugees, are addressed.</SPAN></P>
