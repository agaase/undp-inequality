<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - The visiting British Minister for Overseas Development and Africa said here yesterday that supporting the peaceful resolution of conflicts, the alleviation of poverty through sustainable development as well as sound governance and economic reforms are the guiding principles of her government s policy where this continent was concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a large gathering of diplomats and other prominent personalities at the OAU headquarters, Baroness Lyinda Chalker said the UK, is playing a leading role through its African peace-keeping initiative in helping Africans to respond to regional crisis. The support, she noted, ranged from contributing to the OAU Peace Fund and the new Conflict Management Division to training senior officers from a number of African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Minister, Great Britain and Zimbabwe co-organised a workshop for senior officers from 17 African countries to examine peace- keeping practices and principles. Britain has since hosted two African peace- keeping map exercises most recently, she said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Chalker revealed that the Zimbabwe Staff College has become the first regional &quot;centre of excellence&quot; for UN peace-keeping training, and said that her government assisted its development and in organising first peace-keeping course there. The Minister noted further that the UK is working on a similar centre n Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing the essence of a disciplined military in maintaining stability, baroness Chalker said the her government has this year allocated 6.5 million pounds sterling fro these programmes alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the problems go deeper than technical fixes. All my experience tells me that poverty is a major cause of conflict. No only does it give rise to localised squabbles which then escalate. But more importantly in Africa, and else where, it leads to large people s movement, often across borders,&quot; the minister said, and went on: &quot;The pressures these bring become a cause of conflict in themselves, as recent events in the Great Lakes region have demonstrated. An essential part of the British Government s task is to help reduce poverty and suffering by contributing to sustainable development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rationale in doing so is understood to be that the carefully planned development assistance prevents natural and man-made disasters and so contributes to building stability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Chalker described good governance as the best guarantor of peace in any society and said that the UK government s assistance in this area is aimed at helping promote stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalling that her government last year spend 400 million pounds on direct support for economic reform in Africa, the Minister appreciated Ethiopia and Uganda's stride in this respect. &quot;Rapid and sustained economic development as in Ethiopia and Uganda provide the only basis for reducing poverty,&quot; she noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baroness Lyinda Chalker earlier visited the OAU Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution Centre and met with secretary-general Salim A.  Salim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Ethiopian News Agency reported that Baroness Lyinda Chalker yesterday reiterated he government's support to build the capacity of the House of Peoples Representatives of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the national regional states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During talks with Ato Dawit Yohannes, Speaker of the House, Mrs. Chalker appreciated the way the Ethiopian Parliament was organized and the devolution of power to regional states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During talks with Ato Dawit Yohannes, Speaker of the House, Mrs. Chalkier appreciated the way the Ethiopian Parliament was organized and the devolution of power to regional states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Chalker also told the speaker that the democratization in the country is in the right track and reiterated her country's support to the strengthening of the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Dawit also said that more than 60 political parties are operating in the country out which most are organized representing nations and nationalities while few are national parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the international situation has facilitated conditions for Ethiopia and the United Kingdom to become development partners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The torrid drama surrounding the flight ET 961 disaster off the Comoros a week ago may now be said to be behind us. Not so the searing memory which it left behind for a horror-stricken public to ponder for quite some time yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Put aside for a moment the number of the innocent who were consumed in the cataclysm resulting from the plunge of the national carrier into the depths of the Indian Ocean, eve, though that rates among the highest in living memory. Forget even the anxiety undergone by families and friends of the 175 passengers and crew abroad the doomed airliner awaiting identification, however, almost indescribably unbearable it must have been. It was, rather, the cold- bloodedness of the whole episode that was so terrifying in its utter meaninglessness.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few incidents touch off spontaneous and massive outpourings of horror as do tragedies caused by callous disregard fro human life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such was the fate of flight ET961. The nation observed three days of mourning, with church and mosque joining in the bereavement. They were genuine and deeply felt; so deeply felt was the creation to the tragedy by a grief-stricken public. To the extent that the passengers - both the 125 who perished and 50 survivors - represented no less than 37 countries, it was natural that the grief should have been shared far and near.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts surrounding the tragedy have been dwelt upon at length already.  suffice it to recall that the pilot, ordered to change course to Australia while en route to Abidjan via Nairobi, Brazzaville and Lagos, had made it clear that this was quite simply impossible as he was running out of fuel.  The still unidentified trio of hijackers, desperadoes as it turned out, were not impressed in the least. And so the inevitable followed not long after, earring itself a secure niche in the dark annals of air piracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What, though, is the lesson to be derived from this grisly incident? It is unlikely that there will be an end to the litany of comments and suggestions that will keep pouring in. Streaks of lawlessness in the skies are in any case to be expected every now and then in this age of fast and casual air travel. Beyond renewed calls for still more stringency in international laws and conventions to curb air piracy, one thing would seem obvious: the need for tightening security not only at airports but abroad flights as well.  Innocent passengers such as those who perished or nearly did so off the Comoros last weekend deserve no less.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba today announced a new cabinet for Zambia with a promise to serve better the country so that at the end of his last five year term there will be something by which he will be remembered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the old faces returned to cabinet but quite a few were missing mostly because they had lost elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In remarks preceding the announcement and those made afterwards during a question and answer session with journalists at a State House press conference Mr Chiluba declared that he expected discipline and hard work from his new team of cabinet ministers so that after five years much of the poverty in the country will have been alleviated or drastically reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he did not expect inconsistencies, bickering and the washing of dirty linen in public. He particularly admonished his colleagues in the ruling Movement for Multi-partyt democracy to desist from commenting on Zambia's foreign relations when they had no specialised right to do so.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the new cabinet the obvious omissions are Dr Kabunda Kayongo who has been replaced by Enock Kavindele as Minister of Science, Technology and Vocational Training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another face is that of Dr Luminzu Shimaponda who has been replaced as Minister of Legal Affairs by Mr Vincent Malambo who was an adviser to President Chiluba before he won an election last month. Lt-Colonel (retired) Patrick Kafumukache has also been dropped from the Works and Supply portfolio after he lost his Kabompo seat in the elections of last month. His position has been filled with Sipakeli Walubita, who previously was at Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - The population of buffaloes in Marromeu game reserve, in Central Mozambique's Sofala province, has been drastically reduced by poaching and indiscriminate slaughter, reports Monday's issue of the Maputo-published daily paper, Noticias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noticias quoted the Sofala provincial director of agriculture and fisheries, Antonio Semente, as saying that of the 45,000 buffaloes that once roamed the area, only about 4,000 are left.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attributed the &quot;disastrous scenario&quot; to factors such as the war that affected the area and poaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To reverse the situation, Semente suggested that hunting in the reserve should be prohibited for a period of one year, coupled with &quot;intensified inspection&quot; to prevent poaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Safari operators and licensed hunters have already been made aware of the issue,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Semente explained that these measures will protect not only the buffaloes but other animals as well, such as various species of antelopes which, according to research done in the Zambezi delta, are also threatened with extinction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the uncontrolled abuse of resources did not affect only wildlife, but also forests, which cover an estimated area of four million hectares in Sofala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that in the 1960s and 70s, Sofala provided about half of the country's entire timber industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the years between 1970 and 1975 forest exploitation was increased, reaching 400,000 cubic meters a year. This means that virtually all the accessible forest was exploited with no attention paid to the future,&quot; said Semente.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The northern region of Sofala has a wide range of biodiversity and natural resources, particularly fauna and forests, of local, national and international importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think that it is by preserving these resources that the timber industry can grow and the province would return to what it was before the war,&quot; Semente added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - Leading Kenyan scientists have endorsed the proposed use of the beetle as a biological agent to combat the spread of the water hyacinth weed in Lake Victoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was made last week by top researchers from the Kenya Medical Research Institute, Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, Moi University, the International Center for Insect Physiology and Ecology and the vector borne diseases division of the Kenyan ministry of health.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experts expressed confidence that the beetle would effectively control the menacing weed. The rapid spread of water hyacinth on Lake Victoria, Africa's largest fresh water lake, is gradually becoming an impediment to fishing as well as marine vessel transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backing the government's biological control method against the hyacinth, they said they were ready to assist in the multiplication of the beetles in readiness for their release into the lake in January 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the researchers suggested that exhaustive research has to be conducted before the beetle is used against the weed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The use of the beetles should be cautiously undertaken since some biological agents are known to work well during experiments but fail when applied in the field,&quot; remarked one of the researchers, Dr. A.J. Oloo of the Kenya Medical Research Institute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MUTARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe's timber industry may consider introducing birth control in baboons to reduce their population in the timber- rich Manicaland Province. The acting general manager of the forestry commission, Edward Mutsvairo, said in an interview that the timber industry was losing millions of dollars to baboons which were destroying trees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutsvairo said the timber industry was already looking at ways of controlling the population which was growing at unprecedented levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there were only three alternatives which the timber industry could exploit to realize maximum benefits from their timber plantations and these were: killing the baboons, scaring them out of the forests using dogs and the introduction of birth control measures in the female baboons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The industry is currently losing millions due to the big baboon population that we have in the forests and we are currently looking at ways of how we can control them from destroying the trees. Maybe we will settle for the use of injections or something else...,&quot; Mutsvairo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chimanimani district, which is one of the country's major forestry areas with major sawmills like the Charter and the Chinhokwe Sawmill, has a population of over 2,000 baboons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - President Frederick Chiluba appointed a new cabinet on Monday, in which he retained his vice, Brig. Gen. Godfrey Miyanda and the ministers of defence, home affairs and finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he moved Gen. Christon Tembo from the foreign affairs ministry to the mines and minerals portfolio, and replaced him with a university law professor, Lawrence Shimba, as the new foreign minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others moved to new ministries include Edith Nawakwi, who swapped the ministry of energy with Suresh Desai of the ministry of agriculture.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ministers include Enock Kavindele, who takes over science and technology, David Mpamba (information), Vincent Malambo (legal affairs) and Eric Silwamba, former junior minister in the president's office, who becomes a full cabinet minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nawakwi is one of the two female ministers in the former cabinet who have been retained by Chiluba. Her colleague, Kabunda Kayongo, of science and technology was dropped from the new cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also dropped from the new cabinet is former legal affairs minister Luminzu Shimaponda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the cabinet, Chiluba said that he would demand loyalty and commitment from the new team to enable government make good its promises to the people. He added that the administration would continue to implement the country's current economic reform programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian president reiterated the ban on members of the cabinet and his ruling party from commenting on the country's relations with foreign countries, saying this would remain the prerogative of the foreign minister and himself as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government was recently embarrassed by outbursts by several senior officials against some leaders of neighbouring states who were accused of &quot; interfering&quot; in Zambia's internal affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former foreign minister, Vernon Mwaanga had told off South African President Nelson Mandela for calling for a postponement of last November's elections to allow time for Chiluba's government to reconcile its differences with opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba said Monday that his government will continue to maintain &quot;warm and friendly&quot; relations with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - In a week or so, Africa will come up with an alternative candidate or candidates for the post of United Nations Secretary- General now that incumbent Boutros-Boutros Ghali may not be elected for a second term, following a United States veto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Organization of African Unity (OAU) Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said here Monday that &quot;Africa should not lose the opportunity of having an African elected secretary-general by default&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa is expected to come up with another candidate or candidates before the selection process is thrown to the regions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim, on a tour of West African states, said in an interview with PANA in Dakar that he was consulting with African leaders on the issue and an alternative to Boutros-Ghali should emerge soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it is not necessary or desirable for Africa to have one candidate&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we need is an African secretary-general and we should not allow ourselves to be divided on the issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans should not argue among themselves on an alternative to Boutros- Ghali because the decision of who gets elected ultimately rests with the Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African countries that so far have expressed an interest in forwarding candidates include Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boutros-Ghali was endorsed for re-election by the OAU summit in Yaounde, Cameroon, last July. But his re-election was vetoed by the United States who cast the only negative vote in the 15-member council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the U.S. permanent representative to the U.N., Madeleine Albright, said that the U.S. did not have a candidate for the job but was &quot;waiting for the African countries to come forward with a list of viable candidates...We will like to see a secretary-general from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. objects to Boutros-Ghali's re-election because, it claims, he has been unable to carry out measures to reform the world body. But the former Egyptian foreign minister has won overwhelming support from other members of the U.N.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The Organization of African Unity (OAU) is seeking a durable solution to the crisis in the Great Lakes region that will be sensitive to both the territorial integrity and the legitimate rights of the people in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said in Dakar on Monday that the crisis in the Great Lakes region needs a holistic approach, confidence- building and prompt action to prevent tragedies from happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim, who is in the Senegalese capital to consult with President Abdou Diouf on a number of African problems and issues, said his meeting with President Mobutu Sese Seko in France last Friday &quot;was very good&quot; and the Zairean leader was &quot;very conscious of the need to restore normalcy in the region&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was impressed by his commitment to promote stability in the region and his understanding of the nature of the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said it was time to stop the &quot;fire brigade&quot; approach to African problems and step up measures to prevent calamities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appealed to the international community in the Great Lakes region to work with the OAU to provide the much-needed assistance and prevent problems from becoming tragedies. &quot;They should not be concerned only when a crisis erupts. They should work with us prevent a crisis from becoming a human tragedy,&quot; he said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said the creation of an African force -- to be deployed in crisis areas -- recently proposed by the United States was &quot;fundamentally very sound&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal was not new as the idea of an African peace-keeping force had been endorsed by the 1995 OAU summit and in the next few months a consensus on the nature of the force should emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think eventually it will take off, after consultations&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim departs on Tuesday for Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, for a France-Africa summit in which he hopes to continue his consultations with African leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the summit he will travel to Lome, Togo, to consult President Gnassingbe Eyadema on African problems, including the territorial dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria over the oil-rich Bakassi peninsula. Eyadema has been mediating in the peace talks between the two countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sipie Batignolles signed a contract for completing the Four Seasons Hotel with Ecotur, A Mozambique-South Africa joint venture that now holds the concession on the hotel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of the building work is estimated at 40 million U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French company will start work in January 1997, and the hotel should be completed in the second half of 1998, according to an agreement signed here Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hotel will have a 340-bed, five-star hotel complete with swimming pool, conference hall and casino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hotel will be managed by the Holiday Inn chain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS, New York (PANA) - Organization of African Unity Chairman Paul Biya has asked interested African countries to nominate candidates for the position of United Nations secretary-general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In order to preserve for Africa its chance at a second mandate, the African states should, should they desire, present other qualified candidates along with that of Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,&quot; he said in a letter dated Nov.  29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In it Biya, who is the president of Cameroon, said African states should present their candidates directly to the president of the U.N. Security Council and then inform the O.A.U. chairman.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya's letter has opened the way for Africa to present other candidates for the post, along with Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose bid for a second five-year term was vetoed Nov. 19 by the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the other 14 members of the council, upon whose recommendation the General Assembly elects a U.N. secretary-general, voted for the Boutros-Ghali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya said that his request was to ensure that Africa filled the secretary- generalship if the U.S. continued to veto Boutros-Ghali's candidature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the council have agreed to reserve the first and second stages of their selection process to African candidates to give the continent a chance of winning a second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current term of Boutros-Ghali, a 74-year old Egyptian diplomat, will expire Dec. 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its 32nd summit in Yaounde earlier this year, African leaders endorsed his candidature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At their meeting, African leaders also mandated Biya to consult with other U.N. member states to ensure that Africa would get a second mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have carried out my mission as mandated and I officially presented this position to the General Assembly at the debate on the U.N. on Oct. 24, 1996,&quot; Biya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A two-term tenure has been the past practice when the citizens of other regions occupied the position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the U.S. veto, the African group at the U.N. has said, consistently, that it will stick with Boutros-Ghali until the O.A.U. gives it further directives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Africans being mentioned as possible candidates include the foreign minister of Cote d'Ivoire, Amara Essy, the U.N. under-secretary general for peacekeeping operations, Kofi Annan of Ghana, the secretary-general of the O.  A.U., Salim Ahmed Salim, and the head of the International Peace Academy in New York, Olara Otunnu of Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. says it opposes Boutros-Ghali's candidature for a second-term because he has not carried out enough reform of the U.N.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total cost of the projects, expected to benefit up to one million people, in Bulawayo, Tsholotsho, Lupane and Bubi-Umguza, is about 36 million dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, the deputy minister of lands and water resources, Cain Mathema, said the funds, to cover 55 percent of project costs, would be in the form of a soft loan whose terms were yet to be discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathema, who returned from a business trip to Iran on Friday, said the Iranians had also agreed to provide technical experts for the construction of the dams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Iranians showed us their capacity to build most advanced dams in the world, and we met their syndicates in construction who showed willingness to come here and assist us,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathema said construction of the dams, whose designs were now ready, would begin as soon as cabinet approved the deal with the iranians.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) to His Excellency President Daniel Arap Moi, November 26, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) strongly protests the Nairobi High Court's decision on November 21, 1996, to ban Finance magazine from publishing allegedly libellous articles relating to Chairman Kuria Kanyingi of the Kiambu District. The ruling, which is effective until December 19, 1996, is in connection with articles published in the October 15 and November 15, 1996 issues of Finance magazine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan organization of journalists committed to the defense of our colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ condemns this action against Finance magazine and it's publisher Njehu Gatabaki, who has on various occasions been charged with sedition, as a blatant violation of press freedom. We respectfully remind your Excellency that Kenya ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 19 of which guarantees the right to &quot;seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kind.&quot; These rights are also guaranteed by Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, to which we again respectfully remind Your Excellency, Kenya is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPJ condemns the use of seditious libel statues because they are used exclusively to silence dissent against governing regimes. These laws do not have any place in a democratic society because democratic societies do not criminalize critical reporting - they tolerate and protect it. The right to speak freely without fear of government reprisal is at the very heart of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPJ considers the Nairobi High Court's November 21 ruling to be a serious infringement of press freedom in Kenya and calls for the immediate and unconditional revocation of the ban on Finance magazine. We urge Your Excellency to guarantee the protection of journalists' sources and the media's right to practice their profession freely and safely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA -- Torture and arrests are taking place in the capital and massacres are taking place in areas of intense fighting in Zaire in the growing climate of insecurity and lawlessness, Amnesty International's Deputy Secretary General Herve Berger said today at the end of a two-week investigation trip to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite the authorities&quot; tight control on travel to the country's trouble spots, reports of killings, torture and arbitrary arrest cannot be silenced,&quot; Mr Berger said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zairian authorities have created a climate of intimidation, where questions demanding the truth about the role of the authorities in the current crisis are repressed. People are afraid to talk about recent events such as the persecution of members of Tutsi and Hutu minorities and the role of the Zairian Armed forces in Eastern Zaire. Meanwhile the armed groups in Kivu are committing deliberate and arbitrary killings of Zairians and refugees.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Amnesty International team has documented violent human rights abuses committed by both the Zairian armed forces and the armed group who control much of North and South Kivu in eastern Zaire in a report released today in Kinshasa, (Zaire:Violent persecution by State and armed groups).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have received reports about the slaughter of hundreds of Rwandese refugees and displaced Zairians by Tutsi-led armed groups last week,&quot; Mr.  Berger said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization has obtained reports of hundreds of deliberate and arbitrary killings of Zairian civilians and refugees by members of the Tutsi- led armed groups, now known as L&quot;Alliance des forces democratiques pour la liberation du Congo-Zaire (AFDL) in Bukavu, Uvira and Goma as well as the forcible repatriation of refugees to Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Amnesty International's information, about 500 Rwandese refugees and displaced Zairians were massacred by AFDL members on or around 18 November. The massacre took place at Chimanga refugee camp, about 60 km south of Bukavu. The AFDL have also rounded up and forcibly expelled refugees from Burundi, handing them over to Burundi government troops at the border.  Hundreds of the returned refugees have been slaughtered by Burundi government soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFDL has also attacked the refugee camp of Mugunga, near Goma, causing the mass exodus of refugees to Rwanda. Hundreds of bodies have been found and buried in Mugunga camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today amidst international indifference, hundreds of thousands of Zairian civilians and refugees from Rwanda and Burundi are fleeing violence in eastern Zaire; they are without food, water or medicines,&quot; Mr Berger said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation also fears that severe human rights violations, such as extrajudicial executions are occurring in Kisangani, north central Zaire, which has recently become an operational zone as a result of the conflict in eastern Zaire. The delegation requested authorisation to carry out research in Kisangani, and though the Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Interior assured Amnesty International access, the authorisation was never delivered, raising questions as to whether the authorities had reasons to fear the delegation's presence in Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reports have been received by the organisation about killings, raping and pillage being carried out by the Forces Armees Zairoises ( FAZ), including violent attacks on families including beating and raping women and girls as young as 12 in Kisangani,&quot; Mr Berger said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International has continued to call on the Zairian authorities to end continued human rights violations committed by its own forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization has called both on the FAZ and on the AFDL to adhere to the principles of international humanitarian law through the respect of vulnerable persons (civilians and other persons hors de combat) and by giving access to the victims to humanitarian organizations such as the ICRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigations carried out by the delegation during the last two weeks reveal that the Zairian authorities are responsible for detaining dozens of political prisoners in detention centres throughout the capital. The prisoners are held without charge or trial and are denied access to visits by lawyers, doctors or family members. Some of them are believed to have &quot; disappeared&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is further concerned that the Zairian authorities continue to arrest persons exercising their right to freedom of expression.  Over the last two weeks the delegation has interviewed dozens of victims including parliamentarians, trade unionists, lawyers, journalists and members of NGOs. They told us of beatings, rapes and imprisonment for exercising basic rights. The organization has identified 10 possible prisoners of conscience currently being held in Kinshasa alone. Three human rights activists, Floribert Chebeya Bahizire, Harouna Mbongo and Bashi Nabukili, members of a human rights group La voix des sans voix (VSV), Voice of the Voiceless, were held incommunicado for six days before being released.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - In &quot;Zambia: Elections and Human Rights in the Third Republic,&quot; released today (27 Nov 96), Human Rights Watch/Africa charges that numerous human rights violations before the November 18 vote seriously undermined the legitimacy of the elections themselves and set a negative tone for the country's development over the next several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these parliamentary and presidential elections, the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) won a majority and President Frederick Chiluba was returned for a second term. The vote marked the second multiparty election since 1991, when twenty-seven years of authoritarian rule under Kenneth Kaunda was ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia had been heralded as a model for democracy in Africa after the peaceful transfer of power in 1991. The report details that although Zambia initially made overall progress toward respect for civil and political rights, with some liberalizing reforms, by 1993 the progress appeared to have stopped and the Chiluba government increasingly resorted to methods used under Kaunda rule to suppress criticism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The result is that Zambian citizens are plagued by restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly, intimidation of those in the legal system and harassment of opposition parties,&quot; said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director for Human Rights Watch/Africa and one of the authors of the report. &quot; Some of these abuses are the legacy of the Kaunda years, but in many cases human rights violations are the results of new initiatives by the Chiluba government. We are particularly concerned at increasing government efforts to undermine the NGOs and the judiciary. They are essential foundations of any democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In calling on The World Bank's Consultative Group for Zambia, the U.S.  government and Southern African Development Community countries to continue to pressure the Zambian government to improve its record on human rights, Takirambudde stated, &quot;The international response to the Zambia crisis has been impressive to date. Unity in pressing the government for improved human rights reforms is essential and general support for civic associations and in particular groups that lobby and campaign for human rights standards is needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fifty-three-page report details how state intimidation of the opposition increased significantly in 1995 when former president Kaunda announced a formal return to politics. The runup to the November 18 elections saw a number of abuses. There is evidence that duplicate National Registration Cards were been issued to some voters, that the names of others have been omitted from voters rolls and that duplicate National Registration Cards appeared on the rolls. The ruling MMD also deliberately blurred the distinction between party and state. In Lusaka's Soweto Market the MMD conducted a voter registration exercise, with MMD supporters pressuring voters to confirm their affiliation to the MMD. Human Rights Watch/Africa also obtained documentation proving a government plan to augment the police with MMD supporters prior to the elections. Government officials also threatened to deny state services and programs to constituencies that did not vote for the ruling MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main opposition party, the United National Independence Party (UNIP) also engaged in electoral abuses in by-elections. UNIP sympathizers assaulted MMD supporters and villagers they suspected of backing the MMD. Such inter- political clashes in the by-elections restricted freedom of movement among villagers in several constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government forced a radical amendment to the 1991 constitution through the MMD-dominated parliament in May 1996. Particularly controversial was a provision that imposed new requirements on persons seeking to become president. These included that a candidate be a Zambian citizen born of parents who are Zambian by birth or descent and that the candidate not be a tribal chief. These requirements appeared to be tailored to disqualify specific opposition leaders from running for president, including former president Kenneth Kaunda - who is partially of Malawian heritage - and UNIP's vice presidential candidate - a tribal chief. These restrictions violate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Zambia is a party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June and July 1996, a shadowy group called the &quot;Black Mamba&quot; was blamed by the government for a spate of bomb blasts in Zambia that killed one person.  Eight UNIP officials including its vice president were arrested in connection with the bombings and were committed to the Lusaka High Court charged with treason and murder. The trial provided little evidence to suggest that these UNIP members were involved in any violent conspiracy against the state. It appeared they were detained solely because of their political affiliation. They were acquitted of treason and murder charges by the High Court in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independent press was also the target of government intimidation. &quot;The Post&quot; newspaper has been under particular attack. In February 1996 police arrested three of its editors and banned edition 401 before its distribution because it reported that the government was secretly planning to hold a referendum on the constitution without giving the public time to prepare. The day's on-line edition was also banned, making it the first act of censorship on the Internet in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RECOMMENDATIONS To the Government: Human Rights Watch/Africa calls on the Zambian government to: * Guarantee the independence of the judiciary as required by Zambian and international law. In particular, the government should not orchestrate the appointment or dismissal of judges solely because of their political affiliations or regional origins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Publicly dissociate itself from and condemn any efforts by public officials to undermine the independence of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Facilitate debate of the Mwanakatwe Constitutional Review Commission proposals; call elections to a constituent assembly to review and as appropriate amend the 1991 Constitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Guarantee the right to a fair trial by a competent and objective judiciary in accord with international standards. In cases where this right has been violated, submit the case for retrial or release the defendant. No one should be detained solely for the nonviolent expression of his or her political beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* As promised by the MMD in its election platform in 1991 and in 1996, ensure that all Zambians may exercise their rights to freedom of expression and association, that the organizations of civil society may freely operate, and that checks and balances of the different branches of government are respected. Safeguards to this end should be enacted into law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Guarantee that people with diverse viewpoints are given appropriate access to state-owned radio and television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Ensure a strict division between the functioning of government and the MMD party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Stop providing state funds and facilities to support the MMD's political campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Investigate allegations of police abuse and improper treatment of those in detention, and hold those found responsible accountable before the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Guarantee that prisoners' rights are respected according to international law. This includes the right to be free from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the right to adequate medical and sanitary facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Enact into law the Munyama Commission's recommendation that a permanent human rights commission be established. Ensure that this commission is objective and nonpartisan to avoid the possibility of political bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Provide government officials and police with special training about human rights standards and protection, while instituting procedures through which violations of human rights are the subject of effective investigation and criminal prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To All Political Parties: Human Rights Watch/Africa calls on all Zambian political parties to publicly advocate protection and respect for human rights in their platform and promise to hold party members who commit human rights abuses accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the International Community: Human Rights Watch/Africa recommends that the international community:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Continue to pressure the government to improve its record on human rights as integral to good governance, especially with respect to government transparency and accountability for its actions, through formal communications and other measures such as the conditioning of balance of payments support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Support the efforts of civic organizations to play an active role in civil society, and in particular their efforts to monitor, lobby and campaign for improved human rights standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch/Africa calls on The World Bank's Consultative Group for Zambia (&quot;Paris Club&quot;) to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Continue the Bournemouth meeting's agreed pressure on the Zambian government for &quot;tangible progress on the governance issue,&quot; and include specific reference to human rights as integral to this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Maintain unity in the pressure for an improved Zambian government performance on human rights as integral to good governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch/Africa calls on the United States to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Encourage new U.S. ambassador Arlene Render to act on her commitment to vigorously promote human rights in Zambia by meeting regularly with the Zambia human rights community, publicly denounce human rights abuses, and use U.S. bilateral assistance to Zambia to achieve maximum leverage on human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch/Africa calls on The Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Continue to press the Zambian government to improve its human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Send an investigative team from the SADC Organ on Politics, Defense and Security to Zambia to report back to the Organ about how its member states can improve the human rights record in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Malawi must clarify its position over accepting the forced repatriation of alleged &quot;Malawians&quot; from Zambia, several of these individuals being prominent members of the Zambian opposition who appear arbitrarily to have been stripped of their Zambian nationalities in violation of international standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch/Africa calls on The Commonwealth Secretariat to send a fact-finding mission to Zambia to investigate human rights practices across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch/Africa calls on The African Commission for Human and Peoples' Rights to send a mission to investigate Zambia's current human rights situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - As of 25 November, 27 cases had been identified during the outbreak which started in late July. This includes 2 fatal cases detected through contact tracing of the Gabonese patient treated in South Africa in October.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total number of deaths is 19, and the last death dates back to 5 November. The declaration of the end of the outbreak will take place 42 days after the last death, i.e. on 17 December if no further deaths are registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The role of the Ebola virus has been confirmed by isolation of 2 strains by the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Pasteur Institute, Paris. These strains are very similar to those isolated from the blood of patients in Mayibout in February 1996. Serological results of IgG and IgM ELISA tests showed that infection without clinical symptoms occurred among the contacts. No new case has been diagnosed since 24 October in the Booue region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Reports from Kisangani, in eastern Zaire tell of an increasingly unstable situation in the town. BBC radio today said Zairean rebels claimed they were in control of the town, but this could not be confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire denied the rebels had taken the town and said its forces were in complete control. The situation however was rapidly deteriorating, according to NGOs who had recently arrived from the town. Aviation Sans Frontieres (ASF) are reported to be pulling out of the area after their aircraft came under fire yesterday. Crack troops from the Civil Guard and the Special Presidential Division were reportedly arriving in Kisangani and other parts of eastern Zaire to reinforce the Zairean army. Some 400 Zairean soldiers, who regrouped in Kisangani after fleeing the rebel advance in north Kivu, have remained in the town where shooting and looting are common occurrences.  Soldiers apparently have not been paid and are said to be demoralised as the rebels consolidate their gains. Aid workers who left Kisangani yesterday, said a military plane had arrived from the rebel-captured town of Beni bringing bodies of soldiers killed in the fighting. This added to the tension, heightening fears that insecurity in Kisangani will escalate still further.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kisangani area, home to some 500,000 people, also houses between 2,000- 3,000 displaced persons. Last Friday, WFP was granted a government permit to oversee a feeding programme, but due to the growing insecurity, staff are still in Kinshasa. In the meantime, WFP is arranging the transport of 500 MT of food stocks from Zambia by rail to Kindu, and then by barge to Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Amnesty International report also painted a grim picture of life in Kisangani, saying it feared extrajudicial executions were being carried out in the town. Authorisation was never received to visit the area, but reports spoke of violent attacks on families by Zairean troops, including beating and raping women and girls as young as 12. A field trip to Zaire undertaken by the organisation's deputy Secretary-General Herve Berge highlighted torture and arrests in Kinshasa and massacres in other parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After routing the Zairean army in Beni on Saturday, the rebels were still said to be advancing northwards towards Bunia where the situation was described as very tense. Missionary aircraft, attempting to land in Bunia and nearby Nyakunde today, had to abort as both places were deemed too insecure, while another missionary flight at Rethi, northeast of Bunia, was boarded by a soldier carrying out a search. Soldiers are not normally based in Rethi, which may indicate they are fleeing Bunia, according to a source in touch with the area. Local people on the ground told missionary groups by radio that the rebel focus was now on Bunia. &quot;We are told Zairean soldiers are fleeing in total panic,&quot; said one radio operator, quoted by Reuters. &quot;The rebels are advancing along the road to Bunia, there is complete chaos in Bunia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article over the weekend in the Zairean newspaper &quot;La Reference le Plus&quot; points to the low morale of the Zairean army. According to the report, Butembo - which fell to the rebels on Wednesday - was an easy gain. The lack of a military confrontation was surprising, the newspaper said, as soldiers had a three-day warning of the rebel attack. It questioned how a force 60,000- 10,000 strong was unable to mobilise enough troops to meet the rebel challenge and criticised the government's delay in sending reinforcements. &quot; La Reference&quot; went on to predict the fall of the mineral-rich Kasai region, to the west of Kivu. Another newspaper, &quot;Le Soft&quot; reported on Saturday that forces from the Masisi Hunde and Ngilima militia had allied themselves to the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the war looming on the Shaba-Kivu border, Reuters reports that the first private mining company to invest in Zaire since the 1970s signed a deal to mine copper and cobalt in Shaba. The Swiss-based Groupe Lundin, representing the Canadian company Consolidated Eurocan Ventures (CEV), won agreement from the Zairean government to mine the vast mineral resources at Tenke Fungurume in partnership with the state-owned Gecamines firm. Under the terms of the deal, signed Sunday, CEV will own 55 percent of the Tenke Fungurume project, and Gecamines 45 percent. Lundin chairman Adolf Lundin told Reuters the agreement signified the &quot;rebirth&quot; of Zaire's mining industry and he played down any risk of investing in the country. &quot;Taking risks too much into account is like competing in a marathon with a broken leg,&quot; he said.  Site studies have revealed that Tenke Fungurume could become one of the world's largest open-cast copper mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa is reported calm at the moment, but its dependence on food supplies from the Kivu region threatens to destabilise the situation as prices soar. Red beans have become scarce, increasing in price by 124 percent, while white beans have have increased by 88 percent. The prices of vegetables, usually imported from the Kivu area, have also been dramatically hiked. Potato prices are up by 117 percent, and maize and manioc by 55 percent. Bas-Zaire, and to a lesser extent, Bandundu, are now the main suppliers for Kinshasa but the quality and qauntity are said to be poor. A shortage of beans is expected to create problems for Kinshasa residents who had already substituted beans following an increase in meat prices. This, coupled with inflation, has eroded the purchasing power of many low income residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Raymond Chretien arrived in Nice last night, ahead of a planned meeting with Zairean President Mobutu.  According to AFP he told journalists earlier in the day in the Senegalese capital, Dakar, that Mobutu was &quot;the only one who can bring solutions&quot; to the eastern Zaire crisis. France meanwhile demanded that the immunity of Zairean ambassador Ramazani Baya be lifted so that he could be tried for running down and killing two boys in the southern town of Menton at the weekend. Mobutu is scheduled to meet the mayor of Menton today to discuss the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from the Minova area, south of Sake, concurred that 40,000 refugees discovered in the region had moved on. The UNHCR Goma head of sub-office said they had moved westwards rather than towards Goma as expected. Aerial surveillance showed that the refugee camp at Minova was now empty. Fighting in the area had prohibited access for several days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviewed by the Belgian daily &quot;Le Soir&quot;, Rwandan vice-president Paul Kagame alleged the planned multi-national force in eastern Zaire was merely a &quot;pretext&quot; for propping up Mobutu. He denied that the Rwandan army had taken part in supporting the rebels, but added he was &quot;not altogether unhappy about the events in eastern Zaire.&quot; He also rejected the idea that Rwanda wanted to revise its borders. &quot;We have neither the ability nor the desire to modify our frontiers. We want good relations and safe borders,&quot; he told the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The repatriation of Rwandan refugees from Tanzania could take place before the end of the month, UN sources said today. A UN official in Kigali said refugees seemed &quot;resigned&quot; to repatriation and it appeared the Tanzanian government was pressing for their departure by the end of the year. Of the approximately 500,000 Rwandan refugees in Tanzania, almost all from eastern Rwandan prefectures: 69 percent from Kibungo and 25 percent from Byumba/Umutara. Their return is likely to be through Rusomo in the southeast corner of Kibungo. NGOs said today there was no major movement from Ngara, but the trickle of returnees was increasing significantly and some refugees were selling their possessions. Doubts were cast however on whether a mass return would take place before the harvesting season in January, as many refugees had planted crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Canadian airforce has agreed to move plastic sheeting from Uganda's Entebbe airport to Mwanza in Tanzania, bound for Kasulu and Kibondo districts where a huge influx of refugees from Burundi and Zaire has been reported, according to a UNHCR update yesterday. A total of 46 MT of plastic sheeting for 50,000 people will be flown in aboard two flights scheduled for today, and another one tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR said registration of the estimated 500,000 Rwandan returnees was continuing in the communes without major disruption, according to the Office of the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Rwanda. After this first major batch of arrivals in mid-November, another 50,000 had been recorded since then.  Over the weekend, 1,475 Rwandan refugees arrived in Cyangugu from Bukavu bringing the total number of returnees on that route to some 8,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A two-day meeting in Nairobi on the Great Lakes crisis, convened by ActionAid, ended yesterday with agreement that NGOs should support processes which encourage reconstruction based on local people's initiatives. The conference, which grouped over 50 representatives of humanitarian agencies, the UN, African experts and academics, also believed NGOs should assist women, especially, to understand and enjoy their rights. It gave the example of Rwanda where the majority of households are headed by women, but under Rwandan law they are not allowed to own land, and therefore would have nothing to pass on to their children. The aim of the meeting was to identify the key implications for humanitarian work in the region and explore strategies for short-term relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heads of state and government from 11 central African states met in Brazzaville, Congo, today to discuss regional problems, including the situation in the Great Lakes. The meeting included Burundi's leader Pierre Buyoya, President Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda and Zairean premier Kengo wa Dondo who were meeting for the first time since the crisis broke out in eastern Zaire. A BBC reporter said the gathering was likely to be &quot;volatile&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response to the UN inter-agency flash appeal for the Great Lakes region reached a total of $86,531,222 as of yesterday. The appeal, covering the period 1 November 1996 - 31 January 1997, is trying to raise a total of $259, 466,214. Other donations (mainly to international NGOs) reported to DHA bring the total response to the crisis up to $109 million so far.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome - RWANDA: Over the weekend (30/11 - 1/12), 4,803 returnees entered Gisenyi from Goma. Approximately 1,000 crossed the border on 2 December, most having come from the direction of Minova.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1,475 returnees were registered in Cyangugu between 30 November and 1 December. Transit centres are still being used in Cyangugu for the distribution of WFP returnee food packages given the manageable level of repatriation through this prefecture.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A significant number of 'old caseload' returnees are being forced to give up the houses they have been occupying, as families recently returned from Zaire re-claim their properties. WFP is exploring ways to assist the 'old caseload' returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In anticipation of a significant influx of returnees from Tanzania, WFP is currently pre-positioning additional quantities of food in the prefectures of Kibungo, Cyangugu, Gikongoro and Butare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An FAO/WFP crop and food supply assessment mission will begin work in Rwanda this week. WFP is also participating in a World Bank/UNDP jointly coordinated mission, which will focus on reintegration and rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOMA: Distributions of WFP biscuits continue at road-side way stations, located at Sake, Mugunga, and Kulungu. Approximately, 0.7 mt was distributed on 2 December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of earlier indications given by aerial surveys, the UNHCR/WFP/NGO mission, which visited Numbi on 30 November, found few refugees in the area.  The several hundred refugees remaining in Numbi reported that an earlier concentration of refugees had moved north-westwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UVIRA: A UN/NGO assessment mission departed Bukavu for Uvira at 10:00am on 3 December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KISANGANI: WFP is still waiting for authorisation from the Zairian authorities to conduct an airlift directly from Entebbe to Kisangani. So far, clearance has only been given to fly via Kinshasa, an unfeasible route given the vast distances involved. 95mt of WFP food remains on standby at Entebbe airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP staff in Kisangani report that the security situation is highly unstable. A number of agencies have evacuated or dramatically reduced the level of international staff in the past few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TANZANIA: A meeting of the Tri-partite Commission (UNHCR, Governments of Rwanda and Tanzania) is likely to take place in Ngara or Kigali before the end of this week to discuss modalities for a repatriation of Rwandan refugees from Tanzania. This follows a statement by the Government of Tanzania that the Rwandan refugee problem in Tanzania should be resolved by 31 December 1996. It is likely that the meeting of the Commission will be followed by negotiations with refugee leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BURUNDI: WFP is pursuing all possible solutions to move food and fuel to Bujumbura on Lake Tanganyika from Kigoma, Tanzania. Only by opening up this route will WFP be able to deliver the 2,500 mt authorised by the RSCC, which is needed to feed the growing number of IDPs and returnees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Livingstone - The rogue elephant which killed a Zambian worker barely a week ago has again killed another man - this time a cyclist in the Zimbabwean tourist town of Victoria Falls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwean was killed on Sunday as he was passing on a bicycle near where the elephant was grazing in front of tourists and cross-border traders from Zambia who all watched helplessly as the crazed animal charged after the cyclist, snatched him from the saddle and dashed him to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then in full view of everybody it begun to trample on him until he was reduced to a mess of broken bones and tissue. Then as it went away it rammed several times into a stationery and unoccupied taxi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no further losses of life or injuries before the elephant escaped into the bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week ago the same elephant killed a worker with the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation as he and three other men were going to work in the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that the jumbo disappeared from sight and went to live for some days on an island in the middle of the Zambezi river, metres upstream of the world famous Victoria Falls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian game scouts talked to said the elephant has been provoked beyond reason and that was why it now considered every human being as its personal enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the incident in Zambia a bangling ranger is said to have shot at it three times but he only ended up wounding it and this has even heightened its temper towards human beings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before that some curio sellers and passersby are said to pelted the animal with stones and game scouts suspect that this was the start of its anger towards human beings as it used to live close to hotels in both Zambia and Zimbabwe happily before that.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Bwana-Mkubwa Mining Limited is to re-open the long closed Bwana Mkubwa copper mine near Ndola and bring it into production so it can bear profits for its new owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director of Bwana Mkubwa Mining Limited, Kwalela Lamaswala, says the construction of the project will take 15 months and it is expected that the mine will start production by April 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be the first privately owned copper mining project to come on stream in Zambia since more than 25 years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bwana Mkubwa Mining Limited is a private company registered in May 1996 in Zambia and owned by First Quantum Minerals Limited of Canada and according to the feasibility study undertaken by the company it determined that there is a tailings reserve of 8.4 million tonnes at 0.73c percent copper. The Batement study concluded that the project will be viable at a production rate of 9,954 tonnes of copper per annum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project will have an estimated capital cost of US$26 million for plant construction, and a further US$3 million of working capital allowance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metallurgical tests indicated a conservative copper recovery by acid- leaching of 82.5 percent of copper. The project will consequently use sulphuric acid to leach the copper from the tailings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lamaswala says the new mine is expected to earn Zambia US$21.8 million per annum from copper exports and one of the major innovations in the project design is the use of tanks made from local cement as opposed to imported stainless steel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bwana Mkubwa Mining Limited will also produce 100,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid per year. This will be a bonus increase on the sulphuric acid now coming only from Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines through its smelting of sulphide ores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously the level of this acid production was low resulting in Zambia importing net requirements to meet domestic needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the amount to be made by Bwana Mkubwa Mining Limited 40,000 tonnes will be consumed in the company's metallurgical processes. The excess 60,000 will be sold to local consumers including ZCCM.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The Organization of African Unity (OAU) is seeking a durable solution to the crisis in the Great Lakes region that will be sensitive to both the territorial integrity and the legitimate rights of the people in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said in Dakar on Monday that the crisis in the Great Lakes region needs a holistic approach, confidence- building and prompt action to prevent tragedies from happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim, who is in the Senegalese capital to consult with President Abdou Diouf on a number of African problems and issues, said his meeting with President Mobutu Sese Seko in France last Friday &quot;was very good&quot; and the Zairean leader was &quot;very conscious of the need to restore normalcy in the region&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was impressed by his commitment to promote stability in the region and his understanding of the nature of the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said it was time to stop the &quot;fire brigade&quot; approach to African problems and step up measures to prevent calamities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appealed to the international community in the Great Lakes region to work with the OAU to provide the much-needed assistance and prevent problems from becoming tragedies. &quot;They should not be concerned only when a crisis erupts. They should work with us prevent a crisis from becoming a human tragedy,&quot; he said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said the creation of an African force -- to be deployed in crisis areas -- recently proposed by the United States was &quot;fundamentally very sound&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal was not new as the idea of an African peace-keeping force had been endorsed by the 1995 OAU summit and in the next few months a consensus on the nature of the force should emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think eventually it will take off, after consultations&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim departs on Tuesday for Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, for a France-Africa summit in which he hopes to continue his consultations with African leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the summit he will travel to Lome, Togo, to consult President Gnassingbe Eyadema on African problems, including the territorial dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria over the oil-rich Bakassi peninsula. Eyadema has been mediating in the peace talks between the two countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS, New York (PANA) - Organization of African Unity Chairman Paul Biya has asked interested African countries to nominate candidates for the position of United Nations secretary-general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In order to preserve for Africa its chance at a second mandate, the African states should, should they desire, present other qualified candidates along with that of Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,&quot; he said in a letter dated Nov.  29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In it Biya, who is the president of Cameroon, said African states should present their candidates directly to the president of the U.N. Security Council and then inform the O.A.U. chairman.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya's letter has opened the way for Africa to present other candidates for the post, along with Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose bid for a second five-year term was vetoed Nov. 19 by the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the other 14 members of the council, upon whose recommendation the General Assembly elects a U.N. secretary-general, voted for the Boutros-Ghali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya said that his request was to ensure that Africa filled the secretary- generalship if the U.S. continued to veto Boutros-Ghali's candidature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the council have agreed to reserve the first and second stages of their selection process to African candidates to give the continent a chance of winning a second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current term of Boutros-Ghali, a 74-year old Egyptian diplomat, will expire Dec. 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its 32nd summit in Yaounde earlier this year, African leaders endorsed his candidature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At their meeting, African leaders also mandated Biya to consult with other U.N. member states to ensure that Africa would get a second mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have carried out my mission as mandated and I officially presented this position to the General Assembly at the debate on the U.N. on Oct. 24, 1996,&quot; Biya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A two-term tenure has been the past practice when the citizens of other regions occupied the position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the U.S. veto, the African group at the U.N. has said, consistently, that it will stick with Boutros-Ghali until the O.A.U. gives it further directives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Africans being mentioned as possible candidates include the foreign minister of Cote d'Ivoire, Amara Essy, the U.N. under-secretary general for peacekeeping operations, Kofi Annan of Ghana, the secretary-general of the O.  A.U., Salim Ahmed Salim, and the head of the International Peace Academy in New York, Olara Otunnu of Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. says it opposes Boutros-Ghali's candidature for a second-term because he has not carried out enough reform of the U.N.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An agreement for the transaction was signed November 26 at the Ghana Embassy in Washington D.C. by Tsatsu Tsikata, chief executive of the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), and Rita Rodriguez, member of Exim Bank board of directors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe on Wednesday conceded his country's doctors are poorly remunerated but said sick patients should not be used as sacrificial lambs in bargaining for higher wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officially opening the 47th annual general meeting and scientific conference of the association of surgeons of east and central africa (Asea), Mugabe said doctors should not be allowed to go hungry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is good cause in our circumstances of developing countries for surgeons to appeal, request and demand the most of comfort which will enable them to operate effectively. they should not be allowed to go hungry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our doctors are not well salaried and we should take care of them if they are going to take care of us well,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said the recent strike involving some junior doctors and nurses showed lack of concern for human life in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Surely it can never be right to use the sick patient as our sacrificial lamb in bargaining for higher wages. The medical profession's first responsibility is to serve as a trusted agent of and adviser of patients,&quot; said Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Junior doctors and nurses in Zimbabwe went on strike on Oct. 21 to press government for a general improvement on their conditions of service and an increase in various allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The striking nurses and doctors have since been dismissed, forcing the closure of some wards in major referral hospitals in Harare and Bulawayo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ASEA incoming chairman, Prof. Ignatius Kakande of Uganda's Makerere university, said the relationship between doctors and money was complicated and intricate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The relationship has been represented by triumphant aesculapius who appears as an angel when attending a patient, as a god when he cures and as a devil when he asks for payment for his professional fee,&quot; said Kakane, who took over from Prof. Josephat Mulimba of Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the fact that medical practice is an integral interpersonal relationship between the patient, the society in which we live and the doctor himself, the patient and society have also a duty to ensure that the doctor is facilitated to be able to perform his work efficiently and in peace of mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A hungry doctor is unlikely to perform his duties perfectly. however, since the health of the man is priceless, the surgeon should only demand for his efforts a payment which is adequate and suitable to his personal and family needs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said payment should never be so high as to cancel or neutralize the feeling of gratitude and the spiritual link which should be existing between the patient and his surgeon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The profession should not be turned into a market reality causing its dehumanization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association is composed of seven countries - Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof. Godfrey Muguti, who is president of the surgical society of Zimbabwe, said the annual meeting of the association provided a forum for members to discuss issues of mutual concern and share experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's Bonnie Mauchaza was chosen to be vice-president of the association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 150 delegates from member countries are attending the meeting which ends on Friday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Maputo daily newspaper, Noticias, reported Wednesday that the presiding judge of the Manica provincial court, Valentim Sambo, murdered the servant, only named as Joao, on Nov. 7, according to the provincial attorney's office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The office said the body of the dead man has not yet been found, but there are &quot;credible reports&quot; that it may have been buried or dumped somewhere in the districts of Gondola or Sussundenga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manica provincial attorney, Daniel Magula, told the press that investigations had brought to light evidence that Sambo did indeed murder his servant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the investigations we have carried out, involving the competent authorities and statements from relatives and neighbors, there is no doubt that the judge killed the deceased,&quot; he added. &quot;Whether he has hidden the body is irrelevant. What is relevant for us is that we have sufficient evidence to assert that the person was killed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magula expressed concern over the supreme court's delay in taking action.  Despite pressure from the attorney general's office, the supreme court has not yet suspended the judge. Almost a month after the servant's death, Sambo is still in full power as the Manica presiding judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a fight going on in Maputo between the attorney general's office and the supreme court, while the accused remains unpunished&quot;, accused Magula.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alemayehu and Matias were said to be high school drop-outs, while Sultan Nuru Hussein had completed training as a nurse in Djibouti. All three were unemployed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwean traditional healers who prescribe sexual intercourse with minors as an AIDS cure were blamed Wednesday by a women's rights pressure group for the increase in cases of child sexual abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomsa Ncube, a female lawyer in Bulawayo, said cases of juvenile rape had increased by over 100 percent since 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Traditional healers should be responsible, they are prescribing rapes of small children,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a member of the Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers Association (Zinatha), Lettie Moyo, denied knowledge of such practices. She said that traditional healers who made such prescriptions were not genuine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to regional court records, 90 rape cases were heard between January and November 1995. However during the same period in 1996, 350 cases went through the same court over the same, 90 percent of them involving children under the age of 16 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ncube said more cases were awaiting trial while others had gone unreported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This could just be the tip of the iceberg,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Employees who live with the HIV virus that causes the incurable AIDS face a precarious life in Cote d'Ivoire where tales of mounting discrimination against such workers have just emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a document obtained by PANA in Dakar, the discrimination is practiced under the collusion of employers, trade union officials as well as doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This type of exclusion, in Abidjan, the country's business capital, was revealed in a paper presented at a recent international symposium on Social Sciences and AIDS in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gathering, held from Nov.4-8 in Sali Portudal, Senegal, was sponsored by the French Overseas Organization for Scientific Research (ORSTOM) and the Dakar-based Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the paper's author, Laurent Aventin of ORSTOM, the discriminatory practices include the illicit testing for HIV and abusive job dismissals. He wrote that these practices &quot;probably&quot; exist in other West African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Health Organization statistics indicate that Cote d'Ivoire leads other West African countries in terms of HIV seropositivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As at May 31, 1995, Aventin wrote, Cote d'Ivoire had reported 25,236 cases of full-blown AIDS. The general seropositivity rate is currently estimated at 13.7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He found that employers engage in discrimination against HIV infected people to guard their firms against absenteeism or AIDS-related deaths among their workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his paper, Vantin says the root cause of the discrimination lies in the non-respect of the medical secret by the various AIDS-testing centers in Abidjan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This lack of confidentiality, the document notes, arises from the fact that only between five and six doctors possess specialized certificates in occupational health studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, most the occupation health matters is handled by doctors who reveal the HIV status of workers to the people who employ them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ORSTOM document quoted a study by a female medical student who discovered that out of about 30 doctors employed by firms, 30 percent confirmed passing the results of their tests to employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employers also get information about workers from hospitals, testing centers and the blood transfusion center. The practice of pre-employment testing is also mentioned in the ORSTOM study, although the Ivorian legislation does not demand for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once an employee has been identified to be living with HIV, some managers in Abidjan negotiated for his or her voluntary retirement, sometimes using some trade union leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other employers look for faults by the seropositive worker so as to eventually legally sack him or her on the basis of those mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his conclusion, Aventin makes an urgent appeal on Ivorian work places to stress on AIDS information and education to dispel the existing myths about the disease as well as its modes of transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also stresses the need to sensitize labor inspectors so that they can mete out punishment to discourage the ongoing discriminatory practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The author further urges the Board of the Cote d'Ivoire Medical Order as well as the country's juridical organs &quot;to play a role of prevention, surveillance and punishment especially in situation of non-respect of the medical secret.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United Nations (PANA) - UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros- Ghali has no objections to other African candidates vying for the job he occupies, his spokeswoman said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's always been an open question that anybody can submit their own names to the Security Council,&quot; spokeswoman Sylvana Foa told UN correspondents in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foa was reacting to a letter from the chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), president Paul Biya of Cameroon, urging interested African states to nominate other suitable candidates for the post, in addition to Boutros-Ghali.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that Biya's letter did not represent a shift in the position of the OAU, which endorsed Boutros-Ghali for a second five-year term at its last summit in Yaounde last July. His current term will expire on Dec. 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He (OAU chairman) is asking other heads of state within the OAU for their views on his proposal that other African countries be allowed to submit names directly to the Security Council while reaffirming that Boutros-Ghali is a candidate of the OAU,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the U.S., which is opposed to another term for the secretary- general, interpreted the letter to mean that Africa has abandoned Boutros- Ghali and urged other African candidates to come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were very pleased with the letter from president Paul Biya because in effect it now allows the Security Council to do its work,&quot; U.S. ambassador Madeleine Albright said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It broke the logjam and we think now that we'll be getting names of African candidates,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council members have agreed to give priority to African candidates to ensure that Africa gets a second mandate like other regions which had produced a secretary-general in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process of selecting a candidate to be elected by the 185-members General Assembly has been on hold since Nov. 19, when the U.S. vetoed the candidature of Boutros-Ghali, who received the support of the 14 other members of the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the letter, the African group at the UN had consistently said that it was sticking by the secretary-general pending further instructions from the African leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, after a three-hour closed-door meeting in New York Friday, reaffirmed its backing for Boutros-Ghali, in spite of Biya's letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though no other candidate has emerged so far, several possible candidates, including the OAU secretary-general, Salim Ahmed Salim, the head of the International Peace Academy in New York, Olara Otunnu of Uganda and the UN under-secretary for peacekeeping operations, Kofi Annan of Ghana, are being mentioned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian president Hosni Moubarak met yesterday in Tunis to discuss bilateral relations as well as regional and international issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the official presidential spokesman, Presidents Ben Ali and Moubarak agreed on the need to strengthen bilateral economic and trade relations and the exchange of experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in the region, particularly as regards the Middle East peace process, was also raised. The official spokesman indicated that both presidents reiterated their &quot;deep concern about the threats facing the peace process&quot;, adding that the &quot;international community must measure the consequences&quot; of these dangers on the future of the region and on international relations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official spokesman also said that the situation in Libya and the repercussions of the air embargo were raised by both presidents, who called for a settlement of the conflict opposing Libya to Western countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidents Ben Ali and Moubarak also discussed the situation in Iraq, expressing their &quot;satisfaction following signs announcing the end of the suffering by the Iraqi people,&quot; the official spokesman stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Moubarak, who arrived in Tunis mid-day, left to Cairo late in the afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tunisia Calls for Closer cooperation Between European and Southern Mediterranean Countries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali called for closer collaboration between European countries and those on the southern shores of the Mediterranean in a speech at a conference of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech delivered yesterday by Interior Minister Mohamed Jegham, before the Summit Conference of the OSCE, currently held in Lisbon, Portugal, president Ben Ali said &quot;it is our firm conviction that we should make use of the new world changes and of the possibilities they offer for communication, creative symbiosis and constructive cooperation, to favor closer relations among the partners in the Euro-Mediterranean region and to serve their goals with respect to stability and development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tunisia will continue, from the position it occupies, to work responsibly and with determination to serve these goals, and to guarantee the future of coming generations in our region,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing cooperation between the OSCE and the Mediterranean Countries Partners for Cooperation, president Ben Ali said that it is &quot;far short of expectations, for these countries cannot contribute effectively to dialogue on the subject of security and cooperation in the Euro-Mediterranean area if they do not participate closely ... in the mechanisms set up for that purpose.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Zine El Abdine Ben Ali said &quot;the concept of security is an indivisible whole that is not limited to the military aspect alone, but extends well beyond that to encompass the political, economic, human, social, environmental, and cultural dimensions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heads of governments from 54 countries are taking part in this summit, including the US and Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electronic Quotation System Inaugurated at Stock Exchange</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An electronic quotation system was inaugurated December 2 at the Tunis Stock Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set up in collaboration with the Paris Stock Exchange, the system brings added transparency in transactions and market liquid assets in addition to increased credibility of the Tunisian market, especially with the creation of the Fund for Market security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system is run by a central computer which collates the demand and supply of shares introduced by brokers from terminals set up at the Stock Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of companies listed in the Tunis Stock Exchange increased from 13 in 1990 to 30 companies in 1996. The number of investment companies increased from 18 to 126.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industrial Upgrading Program to Benefit 2,200 companies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 2,200 Tunisian companies will undergo production and managerial restructuring in the next five years as part of the national industrial upgrading program, M. Slaheddine Bouguerra, Minister of Industry told graduating students at the High Institute of Management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bouguerra said that by ratifying the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1989 and becoming a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, Tunisia will have to adjust fully to the requirements of free trade and foreign competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that Tunisian companies must reform their financial, managerial, personnel and production systems to be able to compete globally.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - INTRODUCTION: 1. The reality of life in Uganda today is that the northern one-third of the country is in a state of crisis. Rebels of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) are operating across the north of the country - from Arua, Moyo and Nebbi to Gulu, Kitgum and Apac. Their attacks against the population in the north constitute grave human rights abuses, while their activities are causing massive displacement of the Ugandan population and of Sudanese refugees, with very serious implications for their food security and health. Services such as health and education are in a state of collapse, while the rampant insecurity is undermining the efforts of humanitarian relief agencies to provide even basic emergency assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. This situation report follows a DHA fact-finding mission to Uganda which included visits to Gulu town and to the Kasese area in Kabarole district, scene of a recent rebel invasion from Zaire. It gives a detailed description of the current situation in Gulu district, as well as accounts of the situation in Kitgum and Arua. In looking at the Kasese conflict, it explores the links between this rebel attack and other rebel activities in Uganda as well as the situation in eastern Zaire. The report analyses the background to the current conflicts, setting them in their regional context, and concludes by looking at their implications for Uganda's wider development prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GULU: EPICENTRE OF A GROWING EMERGENCY</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The hospital at Lachor, 5kms from Gulu town, has recently started to receive a category of patient hitherto unseen even in an area which has witnessed barbaric human rights abuses for several years - young people whose feet have been hacked off by rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Four people can be seen in one ward, deprived of their limbs as punishment for riding their bicycles, which the LRA seeks to prohibit on the grounds that bike riders can provide military intelligence to the Ugandan Army. 'It is a miracle they survived', says the doctor in charge, noting that these patients reach the hospital only with the help of other people who risk their lives by providing such assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The hospital itself has 446 beds, each of which is in use, but every evening it is home to some 6,000 people who have left the countryside for the relative safety of the hospital grounds. They lie in the wards, on the concrete pathways which link them, and on every spare patch of ground in the garden and compound. In the morning they filter back to their homes and their fields, only to return again as dusk approaches. The same is true for every major public building in-between the hospital and the centre of the town; a recent census carried out by the local authorities and MSF-Holland found that 15,400 people enter the town each night and leave again the following morning.  In addition, some 30,000 displaced people live in Gulu town on a semi- permanent basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Lachor hospital is currently feeding 60 severely malnourished children, many of whom were caught in the measles epidemic which afflicted the district earlier in the year. In 1995 the hospital registered 184 patients suffering from measles; by October this year it had already registered 744 cases. The epidemic reflects the fact that the authority's immunization programme has been totally undermined by the rampant insecurity. The same is true for the range of health services - whether for treatment of disease or for assisting pregnancies and births. Of the estimated 45 health centres in the district, between 6 and 9 are believed to be still functioning in some fashion.  Qualified staff have fled to the relative safety of the towns, while resupplying centres with drugs and medicines is usually out of the question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Education has also been drastically affected by the conflict; only a handful of the district's 180 primary schools function at present. The targeting of schoolchildren by the LRA is believed to be one of the prime causes, with UNICEF estimating that 3,000 schoolchildren have been abducted by the rebels during 1995 and 1996. The problem is growing not only in Gulu district but also in Kitgum, Arua and Apac - increasingly rebels appear to see children as easy targets in their search to find recruits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Out of Gulu district's population of 390,000 people, between 100,000 and 200,000 are estimated to be displaced from their homes. The figures are guesswork, extrapolated from the levels of displacement observed in those parts of the district from which the local authorities still receive information. What is clear is that displacement, either on a daily basis for overnight stays, or on a semi-permanent basis further away from home, is a way of life for much, perhaps even most, of Gulu's population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. A major consequence for farmers who have left their plots is that they cannot harvest their crops just at the time they have become ripe. Although Gulu district received a bumper harvest this year, thanks to successful planting in August and plentiful rains, rice is rotting in the fields.  Farmers fear to return to their land, in case they are attacked by the LRA, or find themselves caught in the midst of fighting between the LRA and the Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF). This has implications not only for their day-to-day survival, but also for the population's medium-term food security, as they are not selling surpluses and building up the reserves that would see them through future lean times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Landmines are also a serious - and growing - problem. The LRA is using both anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, in fields and on major roads. Lachor hospital carried out 60 amputations on the victims of anti-personnel mines between 1 January 1996 and mid-November; in 1995 the total number was 20. The people who reach the hospital are the lucky ones, most people never make it.  If mines are one of the major problems preventing people in Gulu from resuming normal lives, they are also one of the reasons why none of the international relief agencies is currently working outside Gulu town, with the occasional exception of the ICRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The attention of the international humanitarian agencies has recently been focussed on the question of 'protected villages'. The local authorities characterize these as places, often close to UPDF posts, where people have spontaneously gathered together for their own protection. Displaced people interviewed in Gulu, however, report that UPDF soldiers told them that they would be regarded as rebels if they stayed in their home villages. Leading politicians and soldiers are on record as saying that protected villages will be an important part of their strategy to isolate rebels and deny them food, freedom of movement and the ability to re-group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Although a number of sites are reported each to have attracted several thousand people over the past few weeks, there are also reports that many of these people are already returning to their homes. Certainly, displaced people interviewed at a site designated by the authorities in Gulu expressed a reluctance to stay where they were; having found no food, water or sanitation facilities at the site they were talking about returning home.  Several people said that they felt unsafe in the sites, one of which is already reported to have been attacked by the LRA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Whether or not protected villages develop over the coming weeks will also depend on the ability of aid agencies to provide the services which are lacking, and certainly beyond the means of the local authorities. The LRA has already begun to issue threats against agencies working in the area, presumably aware that the protected villages would, if successful, make rebels much more vulnerable. If humanitarian agencies were seen to be working to the UPDF's agenda, they could easily find themselves the targets of rebel hostilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. At present the World Food Programme is trying to supply emergency relief food to Gulu, and is currently planning a programme for 100,000 people in Gulu town and Kilak, Nyowa, Omoro and Awsa counties (as and when they can be accessed) as well as in the Masindi - Karuma area. In Gulu town the organizations distributing the food are World Vision, Oxfam/Acord, the Church of Uganda and the Catholic diocese. The local authorities have also distributed a certain amount of food. MSF-Holland is helping the health authorities to monitor the health situation, as well as assessing and assisting the water situation in Gulu town. UNICEF is funding vaccination activities in accessible areas and has provided tented schools for Gulu town, while the ICRC and ACF also have teams on the spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KITGUM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. The LRA reportedly use Kitgum as a transit point into and out of Sudan, as well as a base from which to launch attacks in Gulu. Yet Kitgum is not merely an accessory to the conflict in Gulu, as the LRA is also carrying out abductions and killings there; in one incident earlier this year 106 Sudanese refugees were killed. Fighting between the UPDF and LRA is also a frequent occurrence. For these reasons Kitgum is experiencing many of Gulu's problems, notably population displacement and widespread disruption to agriculture, the latter manifesting itself in shortages of maize and millet. One international NGO estimates that half of the district's population, about 180,000 people, may suffer food shortages next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. Kitgum's health situation is also of great concern, as insecurity allows only intermittent access to rural health centres by would- be beneficiaries and the district health teams upon whom they rely. As in Gulu, the authorities have found it hard to attract and retain qualified health staff. Kitgum has experienced two minor cholera outbreaks this year, one from January to March and another in September and October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. Growing insecurity has also prompted a major change in the way humanitarian agencies in Kitgum operate; while at the beginning of the year they were travelling around by road and carrying out routine activities, today they fly in and out of the district and focus on essential needs. 'The quality and coverage in terms of health care in northern Uganda, particularly in Gulu and Kitgum, has declined in a drastic way in 1996', says Dr Viviane Van Steirteghen of UNICEF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE WEST NILE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. Arua has experienced insecurity for several years as it is the main district affected by the West Nile Bank Front's insurgency. At the beginning of this year, however, the situation was sufficiently stable for agencies working in the district to plan development programmes. Even until the end of September development agencies were working in rural areas, both with Ugandans and with approximately 190,000 Sudanese refugees (who are divided between Arua and the neighbouring district of Moyo to the east).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">18. Yet during October and November the local population has found itself the target of a growing number of killings, rapes and abductions by the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), whose modus operandi appears increasingly similar to that of the LRA. At the same time, attacks on Sudanese refugees and the agencies that are working with them have escalated dramatically. The result has been the large-scale displacement of the Ugandan population living close to the border with Zaire and the displacement from settled camps of tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">19. Sudanese refugees at Ikafe and Imvepi, camps which are home to 55,000 people, have been raped, abducted and killed. Their homes have been burnt to the ground and 25,000 people are known to be displaced. The agencies working with them have received threats and had their compounds repeatedly looted, while several Ugandan staff members have been abducted. Palorinya refugee camp in Moyo district has also been repeatedly attacked, while UNHCR's base at Pakelle was attacked and looted earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">20. The roads into and around Arua are increasingly difficult to use; anti- personnel and anti-tank mines are a major hazard, while one agency working in the district estimates that nine bridges have been blown in the last four weeks alone. The road from Pakwach which skirts the western edge of the district through Arua town and on to Koboko is described by WFP as 'very insecure'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">21. The message received by the Sudanese refugees has been plain, as this testimony from a Sudanese woman, displaced from her refugee camp, reveals: 'After the first attack, I moved from Point to Point; I was afraid to sleep in my own home. Sometimes I slept in the bush, sometimes with friends... My mind was badly disturbed. I had most of my things looted in the first attack, then when the rebels burnt Point J, I lost whatever was remaining. They told us that they didn't want to see anyone left in the camps; they said 'Even if you go to Bidibidi (transit centre), we'll chase you from there. We're giving you a warning. Go back to Sudan. I fear in my heart that I will be killed; any one with any responsibility is targeted. If I could find a way of going out, I would try... we didn't come here to die.'(1)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">22. Observers of Uganda believe that one of the reasons why refugees have been targeted is that the WNBF is believed to suspect them of supporting the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which is fighting a protracted war against the Islamic Government of Sudan. As the war rages on, many refugees fear that they will be conscripted if they return to Sudan. One young man, quoted in an internal NGO report said, 'Anyone aged 12-20 years, girl or boy, is handed a gun immediately they cross to the liberated areas; then young men up to 50 years are all called on to fight. It's the same in the government areas, except the age limit is 18 years.'(2)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">23. Arua town's population has been swelled by the influx of about 25,000 displaced people, while Koboko town to the north is home to 20,000 Sudanese refugees displaced from their camps. Although trading continues across the border with Zaire, supplying any part of the district with provisions from southern Uganda is exceptionally difficult under the present circumstances.  Meanwhile, aid agencies are confining themselves to Arua town, hoping that security will improve, thereby allowing them to resume their programmes.  There are, however, very few grounds for optimism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KASESE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">24. On the morning of 13 November, residents of Bwera town suddenly heard gunshots around the UPDF's base in the town. Panic-stricken, they fled their homes, leaving possessions and relatives elsewhere in the town behind. They reported seeing 'rebels', dressed in rags and dirty military uniforms, and speaking Baganda, Bankole and Bakanjo, the former being Ugandan languages and the latter the language of the border area between Uganda and Zaire that centres on the Ruhenzori mountains. An elderly woman was told either to get away from the fighting or to go behind the attackers; they were looking for UPDF soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">25. Bwera town fell to the rebels but was re-taken by the UPDF over the course of the following weekend. Mpondwe border post was also taken by the rebels, but recaptured by the UPDF early the following week. Meanwhile, some 25,000 people from around the area fled their homes and congregated in Kasese town and along and around the small road that links the main Kasese - Bushenyi road with Bwera and Mpondwe to its west. The displaced people were assisted by the ICRC and the Ugandan Red Cross, WFP and MSF-France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">26. The account from the Government-owned New Vision was that the UPDF death toll stood at 34 and that 'about 400' rebels had been killed. The UPDF response reportedly involved sending reinforcements from Mbarara and Mbale and soldiers from 4th Division, Gulu, as well as bombing the Zairean town of Kasindi which the UPDF alleged to be the rebel base. President Museveni visited the border area soon after security had been restored and was photographed on the spot with an AK-47 casually slung over his shoulder. As relative peace returned to the area, residents of Bwera began to make their way home, at first in small numbers and later with increasing urgency on hearing reports that their homes were being looted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">27. Throughout the duration of the conflict a series of conflicting reports and commentary made front page news on Uganda's leading papers - the New Vision and The Monitor. The rebels were described as being variously 450, 710 and 1,500 strong. They were said to be members of the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU), a small rebel movement that had caused skirmishes in the same area in the early 1990s, backed up by soldiers of the Zairean Army. Reports also emerged that the Rwandan Interahamwe and rebels from the West Nile Bank Front were involved. Later still there were reports that Salaf Tabliq Islamic militants had played a leading role and reference was made to a rebel group called the Allied Democratic Forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">28. On 19 November the New Vision linked the attack with information received from surrendered LRA fighters who had reported that the LRA, WNBF, Salaf Tabliqs and other rebel groups had held a meeting in the main LRA camp at Aruu, about 50kms south of Juba in south Sudan, the previous week, and agreed to coordinate attacks on the UPDF beginning in November. Under this agreement, Joseph Kony, leader of the LRA, would be the overall commander of the Allied Democratic Forces. In broad terms this view appears to be shared by Museveni, who was reported to have alleged at a recent press conference that 'Joseph Kony, Juma Oris, the Muslim tabliqs have done their coordination supported by Sudan'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">29. The close proximity of the crisis in eastern Zaire is already making its presence felt in Uganda, with the arrival of some 8,000 mainly Zairean refugees into the Kisoro area and another 3,500 to Matanda. Yet if the Banyamulenge forces continue their advance northwards along the Zaire-Uganda border, it appears likely that, as in the case of Uvira, Bukavu and Goma, there will be substantial displacement of populations in the border area. As the area further north is the stronghold of WNBF rebels, this could affect security in Uganda's border areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BACKGROUND TO THE CONFLICTS IN THE NORTH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">30. Certain points of comparison may be made between the two rebel movements now bringing insecurity to swathes of northern Uganda -the LRA and the WNBF. The north of the country was the major recruiting ground for soldiers in the Ugandan Army for several generations. While Milton Obote recruited his military elite from the Acholi and Langi ethnic groups in the Gulu area, Idi Amin favoured the Aringa and Kakwa people of Arua and many of his soldiers came from there. Both the LRA and the WNBF have drawn support from the defeated militaries of these previous regimes, and from two districts whose people feel they have lost power to the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">31. The districts which form the heartland of the WNBF and the LRA - the West Nile (Arua, Nebbi and Moyo) and Gulu/Kitgum - are among the poorest in Uganda. Uganda's recent economic success has been first and foremost a southern phenomenon - its effects have barely been felt in the north, in part because of the catch-22 of the current insecurity. But in terms of services such as health and education, in terms of infrastructure and economic opportunities, northern Uganda has lagged behind the rest of the country. Its soldiers, defeated in battle and returning home after spells as refugees in neighbouring countries, came back to an impoverished countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">32. Yet while the WNBF appears to have the goal of restoring Idi Amin to power (its chief is Colonel Juma Oris, once Idi Amin's Foreign Minister), the LRA's philosophy is difficult to comprehend. Its leaders, first Alice Lakwena and now Joseph Kony, claim inspiration from a holy spirit claimed to be 'the spirit of an Italian who had died during the First World War, aged 95, near the sources of the Nile'(3). This reincarnated being is supposed to have taken possession of the two successive leaders of the LRA, impelling them to fight the war they are now engaged in. The LRA's belief system reportedly echos strongly traditional belief systems among the Acholi.(4)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">33. The extent to which either the WNBF or the LRA receive the active support of the population in the West Nile and Gulu/Kitgum is a hotly debated issue. Neither group could have survived for the past ten years without a substantial measure of local backing - but to what extent is this the result of genuine support and to what extent the result of fear? The WNBF has, until recently, not resorted to abducting people as a means of recruitment, suggesting it has been able to find people in the area who are willing to join voluntarily (although there are frequent reports that WNBF recruits are offered money as an inducement to joining). The WNBF has not, to anywhere near the same extent as the LRA, targeted the civilian population in the West Nile; one of the main reasons why the Government of Uganda has consistently offered former WNBF fighters amnesty. The same offer has been extended to the LRA rank and file, but not to senior commanders such as Joseph Kony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">34. The LRA, however, has made abductions of children a central part of its recruitment strategy, and its killings and maimings appear designed to induce terror among the civilian population. One Ugandan employee of an international NGO, when asked whether people in Gulu support the LRA, said, 'the population is in a dilemma. They are very frightened. If they report on the rebels they fear the LRA will kill them, if they don't report they fear the UPDF will kill them. The army is near towns, people living out in the villages are unprotected. If the rebels come for food they have no way to say 'no'.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">35. Neither the WNBF nor the LRA could have survived without using neighbouring countries as bases for their operations. The WNBF has used Zaire, establishing camps along the border west of Arua and north to Koboko, as well as Sudan, and is alleged by Ugandan officials to receive the backing of the Sudanese Government. The LRA uses southern Sudan as its base, and people formerly abducted by the rebels report this is where they received their training. The LRA's operations have intensified during 1996 and their weapons have become more sophisticated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">36. At the same time, there are continued allegations that the Government of Uganda supports the SPLA. Reports of direct clashes between the UPDF and the Sudanese Army are not unheard-of. The Economist Intelligence Unit, in its third-quarter report of 1996, states that 'during an encounter with the pro- Idi Amin West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) rebels in the Uganda-Sudan- Zaire border region, the Ugandan army was drawn into an artillery exchange with the Sudanese army - a reminder of the continued hostilities between Kampala and Khartoum.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">37. Diplomatic efforts aimed at normalizing relations between the two countries, the most recent of which were mediated by Iran and resulted in an agreement on 8 September, appear to have made little difference to the realities on the ground. One of the central tenets of the agreement was that neither Uganda nor Sudan would allow its territory to be used to mount attacks on its neighbour. Yet, less than a fortnight later on 22 September, Sudanese Government aircraft bombed Moyo, apparently targeting the army camp there. Sudan at first denied the attack, then claimed it was the result of pilot error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">38. The growing crisis in the north currently dominates debate at the Parliament of Uganda, where the Parliamentary Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs is conducting an inquiry into the war. The Committee has been mandated to do this by the passage of a motion in Parliament in August calling for the committee to 'urgently look into all aspects of the war currently taking place in Northern Uganda with the aim of bringing it to a speedy end.' Among the issues which the committee is expected to address are the 'cause or causes of the war', the 'reason or reasons why the war has taken so long', the 'various solutions available to end the war' and 'allegations of external support or influence'. The committee is expected to report to Parliament sometime before Christmas, and its recommendations will then be debated. Meanwhile, observers point to the appointment of Museveni's half-brother, Major General Salim Saleh, to the position of overall commander of the military operations, and Museveni's stay in Gulu during October, as signs that the President takes the conflict seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCLUSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">39. The northern war is now high on the national political agenda, but will also be of growing concern to donors and would-be investors. Uganda's economy has been transformed over the past decade and during 1995/96 GDP was estimated to have grown by 8.2%, with 'a notable 18% expansion in manufacturing (the best for ten years) and an unprecedented 16% in cash crop agriculture.' (5) Yet while these achievements are recognized abroad, there is also concern that, as the Economist put it, '(T)he northern rebels are responsible for causing unacceptable levels of military expenditure and the problem of instability is diverting government energies from important development problems.'(6)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">40. These issues were raised by donors at the recent Consultative Group meeting in Paris, where donor countries failed to reach agreement on writing off part of Uganda's $3.3 billion debt. The problems in the north and rising military spending were cited as areas of particular concern, with a World Bank statement saying that donors expressed 'considerable concern' about the northern war and 'urged the Ugandan government to explore all possible initiatives which could bring a satisfactory resolution.'(7)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">41. The crisis in the north is now receiving the national political attention it deserves. Quick-fix solutions are difficult to envisage, given the complex mix of military, political and economic issues at stake. The regional dimension to the conflict is another central issue, implying that Uganda's relations with its neighbours will continue to be a major influence on how the situation evolves. The Parliamentary Committee investigating the war and seeking to come up with solutions is a most welcome initiative and deserves the attention and support of governments worldwide. It is very much to be hoped that its recommendations will foster initiatives which bring the conflict, with all its attendant human suffering, closer to an end.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Ugandan military sources say rebels in eastern Zaire have captured the town of Bunia, forcing looting and rampaging Zairean soldiers to flee further north. Reuters quoted the sources as saying the town fell on Monday night, and that yesterday rebels were clearing pockets of resistance.  Zairean refugees, arriving in the Ugandan border town of Kasese to escape the fighting, said soldiers pillaged Bunia, beat up residents and raped women before the rebel takeover. Missionary sources in the area appeared to confirm the reports, saying soldiers were looting from Sunday onwards and by last night all the FAZ troops had left. Some sources suggest the troops may head for Isiro, over 350km to the northwest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renewed clashes broke out in western Uganda yesterday after Zaire-based rebels crossed over the border, the &quot;New Vision&quot; reported today. It quoted fleeing civilians as saying there was fierce fighting between Ugandan soldiers and some 100 rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), who entered via Bwera. Ugandan military sources said there were casualties on both sides. The rebels invaded Uganda last month, but were pushed back into Zaire after a week of heavy fighting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean premier Kengo wa Dondo has accused Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi of aggression against his country, aimed at setting up a &quot;Tutsi empire&quot;, and called for the rapid deployment of a multi-national force to help &quot;a million Rwandese refugees&quot; in eastern Zaire. Speaking at the Congo summit of central African leaders yesterday, he also reiterated Kinshasa's opposition to food airdrops and to the establishment of the force's HQ in Uganda, saying it should be set up in Kisangani. Burundian leader Pierre Buyoya, in comments broadcast by Burundi radio yesterday, told the meeting the economic embargo against his country was the main obstacle to peace. Burundi, he said, was waiting for the world community and regional leaders to show &quot;active solidarity.&quot; &quot;The international community cannot bring about peace among the people of the Great Lakes without us,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From Congo, Buyoya has gone on to Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso to attend a Franco-African summit due to open tomorrow. Rwandan foreign minister Anastase Gasana, who is representing his country at the meeting, lashed out at UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali yesterday accusing him of presiding over &quot;failure after failure.&quot; According to a statement, issued in Ouagadougou, he said that &quot;under his mandate, Africa went through a horrible genocide, and that tragedy took place in Rwanda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali maintains that a military multi- national force is still required for eastern Zaire, despite the fact that prospective participants want to scale down or scrap plans for troop intervention. In a report to the Security Council, he said the humanitarian situation in the region was undergoing &quot;dramatic changes&quot; and was likely to evolve rapidly in the coming weeks. He warned there must be no return to the &quot; status quo ante&quot; and above all no re-creation of refugee camps in eastern Zaire. The immediate concern, he said, was the fact that hundreds of thousands of people were still facing hunger, disease and death in eastern Zaire and the only practical way to avoid a humanitarian disaster was to establish some form of international military presence in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the multi-national force Lt Gen Maurice Baril stressed that fighting in eastern Zaire was changing very quickly and could be &quot;extremely dangerous&quot; for any force attempting to aid refugees. Speaking from Uganda's Entebbe airport yesterday, according to Associated Press, he said 13 countries had promised air assistance to the multi-national effort and the force would be increased to 460 in the next 10 days, in addition to the 300 US troops operating separately from Entebbe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A question mark remained over the status of Kindu after Zairean rebels claimed today they had taken the town. However sources on the ground dismissed the claim, saying Zairean troops were in control. The rising insecurity and tension threatens limited relief operations mounted in the area. An ICRC update yesterday said the Committee was setting up a logistical base in Kindu where a group of 300 displaced people had already received assistance. A Zairean Red Cross truck carrying ICRC relief supplies left Kindu for Shabunda and a small ICRC aircraft landed at Kalima, between Kindu and Shabunda, to hand over relief items to the local Red Cross which is assisting some 500 displaced people. ICRC also said a team had managed to get through to Rutshuru from Goma. Further south, ICRC delegates reached Kalemie where over 8,000 people have sought shelter. They will receive assistance from Lubumbashi. Meanwhile, a source in Walikale confirmed the presence of large numbers of former Rwandan soldiers and Interahamwe militia and their families in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports continued to filter through of the unstable situation in Kisangani.  UNICEF pulled its last two staff members out of the town on Monday due to insecurity, Reuters reported. Steven Allen, UNICEF representative in Kinshasa, said that before they left, the staff members reported shooting between different elements of the Zairean army, apparently triggered by the arrival of wounded and dead soldiers from the rebel-captured town of Beni. At least 1, 000 soldiers, plus their families, are reported to be in the town and that number may be swollen by soldiers who allegedly do not want to be registered for fear of being sent back to the front. However the situation was described as relatively calm last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP said it was still waiting for authorisation from the Zairean authorities to conduct an airlift from Entebbe to Kisangani, but so far clearance had only been given to fly via Kinshasa - which WFP regards as an &quot; unfeasible route&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first UN/NGO team to visit Uvira since aid agencies pulled out on October 22 arrived in the town from Bukavu yesterday to assess the situation there. WFP said the team - comprising representatives from UNHCR, DHA, WFP, UNICEF, MSF, ICRC, IFRC - stayed overnight. Checkpoints were reported along the roads, but the road conditions were said to be good. Aid agency compounds within Uvira had been heavily looted, but the hospital appeared to be functioning relatively normally. All the refugee camps seen on the trip were empty. WFP said a request to visit the Uvira port would probably be granted later in the week. The border with Burundi is still closed on the Zairean side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 1,500 refugees from Zaire are reported in the Congolese capital Brazzaville, 85 percent of them ethnic Tutsis mostly from the Kinshasa area.  There are 10-40 new arrivals each day and WFP is preparing an assessment mission to the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP has said it is preparing for a possible influx of Rwandan refugees from Tanzania by prepositioning food at commune level in and biscuits en route.  Reports say the Tanzanian government has ordered all Rwandan refugees out of the country by the end of the year. WFP said a meeting of the tripartite commission (UNHCR, Rwanda and Tanzania) was likely to take place in Ngara, Tanzania, or Kigali before the end of the week to discuss modalities for repatriating the Rwandans. The multi-national force successfully completed four airlifts carrying a total of 10,000 plastic sheets to Mwanza in Tanzania.  The sheeting will be used by new Burundian arrivals further south.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome - UVIRA: A UN/NGO team (WFP, UNHCR, DHA, UNICEF, MSF, ICRC and IRC) visited Uvira on 3 December to conduct a brief assessment. The team met with the de facto authorities and were able to visit the town. While some WFP local staff are still in place, the WFP Office has been completely looted, as have the temporary warehouses. Access to the port was denied; however, the two cranes are reported to be more or less intact.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uvira town is reported to be very calm: markets have re-opened and are quite well supplied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial traffic on the escarpment road is reported to be quite normal.  No refugees were seen on the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further mission is planned Friday 6 December for a longer period (2 or 3 days). It is hoped that this mission can visit Fizi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TANZANIA: Tanzanian authorities have begun visiting the camps to inform refugees that repatriation must take place imminently. 275 refugees registered with UNHCR on 3 December for repatriation, the largest figure recorded on a single day in the region to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tripartite Commission (UNHCR, Governments of Rwanda and Tanzania) will meet shortly to discuss detailed plans for the return of the majority of Rwandan refugees. No firm date has been set for this meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns continue regarding the nutritional status of refugees arriving in the Kigoma region from Burundi. The malnutrition rate for children under five was recently recorded at almost 19 per cent in Mtendeli camp, which has received approximately 40,000 new Burundian refugees since the beginning of November. WFP is sending additional quantities of CSB to Kigoma region for supplementary feeding programmes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambian travellers to Britain will not require to undergo HIV/AIDS tests upon arrival there, Chief Immigration Officer Philip Mutantika clarified today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explanation may bring relief to most Zambians but it still leaves a bad taste in the mouth especially after receiving further 'punitive' news that one time friend of Zambia, Lynda Chalker, is now on a campaign trail lobbying the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to cut developmental aid funds to Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mutantika observed that the earlier statement by departmental spokesperson, Catherine Poso, was a slight misrepresentation of fact in that it was based on the information outline at the back of the 'Application for United Kingdom Entry Clearance' form JM2A (Revised 6/92) which reads in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An Immigration officer can ask anyone to be medically examined on arrival in the UK if he considers it necessary. If you intend to stay in the UK longer than six months you may be required to have a medical examination before your entry clearance is issued.&quot; It reads in part.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mutantika explained that this requirement does not make any medical examination compulsory to Zambian travellers nor any other foreign visitor to the United Kingdom adding that this is standard practice in many countries around the world and should not be misunderstood to be meant for Zambians alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also dismissed suggestions that his department could have adopted punitive measures against British teeanagers explaining that the requirement that children under the age of 16 acquire visas before they can enter Zambia was a reciprocal one which was equally applicable to Zambian youths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mutantika observed that in order to allow for a smooth transition the department to give a grace period of seven days from Monday - December 2 to December 9 in which British Nationals wishing to travel to Zambia can obtain their visas on arrival at any point of entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dismissed suggestions that application forms were in short supply at Zambian Missions Abroad saying since Zambia has been issuing visas all along to various nationals there can be no shortage of these forms at embassies abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Visa row, as it has come to be known by the Zambian press was ignited by Britain when the local office announced that with effect from this year it will be become a pre-travel requirement for Zambians to have visas enabling them even to transit through the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it was explained that the requirement was purely a follow-up to dictates of European Union requirements many Zambians were not convinced that the move was driven by a lack of harmony over what the Zambians themselves desired politically and what the British government wanted them to have as part of their colonial legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matters came to a head last May when bowing to growing internal pressure President Chiluba signed a Constitutional amendment which restricted the presidency to second generation Zambians and which in effect buried the leadership ambitions of former state president, Kenneth Kaunda, who only months earlier had been resurrected from the archives of history by his party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda was unhappy with his exclusion and so were the clutch of brief-case, 'one agenda' portfolios masquarading as political parties and which saw Kaunda as their last chance of amounting to something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the people have at last spoken through the ballot most Zambians were hopeful that bygones will be bygones and that the strained relations will be mended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to their amazement the reverse appears to be true and hence sthe acceptance that the British government now simply wanted to humiliate them for no apparent reason by demanding that they undergo AIDS tests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia National Oil Company Limited on Monday announced a fifteen percent fuel price rise which on Tuesday provoked a sharp reaction from farmers who feel the burden on them is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement from ZNOC gave the main reason for the increase as 'increased costs resulting from the depreciation of the Kwacha against international currencies and the increase in the international prices of petroleum products'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 15 percent price increase has been slapped on petrol, diesel and domestic paraffin (kerosene) and the new prices took effect at midnight on December 2.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zambia National Farmers' Union reacted by calling on government to exempt them from the universal national fuel levy as one way of reducing the impact of the increased fuel prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZNFU Executive Director, George Gray, observed that though farmers had anticipated the fuel price increase as far back as October the new prices will, never the less place an extra burden on farmers who use considerable amounts of fuel particularly at this time of the year when the rains are re- appearing and the farming season goes into top gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of fuel will impact not only on farmers cultivating the land but also on transporters who move food from farms to storage facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The end result will be considerably increased upward pressure on the price of food,&quot; Dr Gray lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of this the farmers were then suggesting that they be exempted from paying fuel levies which are included in prices of automobile fuel from the pump and which money is used to pay for the maintenance of the roads in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument advanced by farmers is that most of their machinery and implements rarely leave the farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The tractors that farmers use to work the fields seldom drive on roads and it is not right that farmers should be faced with a heavy charge to fund a service which they do not use,&quot; Dr Gray pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the fuel levy was removed then both farmers and consumers would benefit as there would be lesser costs on the production of food and this would result in stabilised prices for the consumer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The new Zambian cabinet was on Tuesday sworn into office at State House with a message from President Frederick Chiluba that he expects hard work and collective responsibility from all of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Collective responsibility is important for all of us and even if a minister holds a different view once a decision is taken in Parliament, there should be no contradictions or divisions because this would make it difficult to run government,&quot; he declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba also disclosed at the ceremony that he had nominated hard working Lusaka Province MMD chairman, Christopher Chawinga, to serve as a nominated member of parliament.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition he has also appointed Zambezi West MP David Saviye to the post of Deputy Minister in the office of the Vice-President. He was until a few months provincial information officer with the Department of Zambia Information Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other promotion is that of Mkushi South MP, Abel Chambeshi, who becomes Central Province Deputy Minister. Like Mr Saviye, Mr Chambeshi is also a former journalist who many years ago worked for the Zambia News Agency before he resigned to join the Times of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his timely warning Mr Chiluba revealed that several times he had been embarrassed, in his first term, by the tendency by some ministers to dissassociates themselves from collective decisions which they should have supported both in public and privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President also warned his cabinet colleagues against reporting for work late saying this was not a sign of seriousness in the work of government and it must be stopped immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Punctuality among cabinet minister, he emphasised, reflected the seriousness of the nation to achieve set goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the swearing in ceremony three ministers out-did themselves when they reported late though the function had been delayed by 30 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba, however, expressed confidence in his new cabinet saying it has the capacity to deliver goods. He is expected to preside over the swearing in of Deputy Ministers on Wednesday morning.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States warmly welcomes the peace agreement signed by President of the Republic of Sierra Leone Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and the leader of the Revolutionary United Front (RUE) Corporal Foday Sankoh in Abidjan on November 30.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">We salute President Kabbah and Mr. Sankoh for this milestone achievement that opens a new chapter of hope for all the people of Sierra Leone. This agreement ends a five-year civil war in Sierra Leone and creates the conditions which will allow over one and a half million internally displaced people and refugees to return to their homes. We also commend the Government of Cote d'Ivoire and the U.N. Secretary-General's Special Envoy to Sierra Leone, Berhanu Dinka, for their constructive roles in support of the Sierra Leone peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We encourage the rapid demobilization and reintegration of both RUF and Sierra Leone military forces. An arduous process of rebuilding the country's shattered infrastructure and economy lies ahead. The United States will remain engaged with Sierra Leone's rehabilitation and reconstruction program by providing food aid and other humanitarian assistance. In the spirit of national unity, we urge all Sierra Leoneans to support the Government of Sierra Leone's efforts to achieve reconciliation and economic development.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Text of President Clinton's December 2 letter to the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and the president pro-tempore of the U.S.  Senate, briefing both congressional leaders on the current crisis in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The humanitarian situation in Rwanda and the Great Lakes region of eastern Zaire has been a continuing source of international concern. Although approximately 600,000 refugees have recently returned to Rwanda from Zaire, the situation remains uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 200,000 or more refugees and displaced persons remain scattered in eastern Zaire likely without adequate food, water, shelter, or medical care. Repatriation is expected to continue in the foreseeable future.  Urgent action may still be required, however, to supply essential relief to refugees and displaced persons still located in eastern Zaire and to assist those refugees that have returned to Rwanda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1080 (1996), the United States plans to participate in a multinational effort, led by Canada, to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance and to facilitate the voluntary, orderly repatriation of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian aid organizations as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons. Pending final consultation with our allies, I expect the United States to contribute personnel and equipment to the headquarters, civil-military affairs and psychological operations units, and other support elements as required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In furtherance of UNSCR 1080 and the aim of the multinational effort, the United States has already positioned personnel and equipment in furtherance of &quot;Operation Guardian Assistance&quot; (approximately 400 personnel are currently in the region) to conduct non-combat missions, including airlift, air control, and related services in support of ongoing humanitarian efforts by Rwanda and private relief organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the U.S. assistance to the region has been helping locate groups of refugees and displaced persons to ascertain their movement and condition. The United States has used aircraft and other means in an effort to gain accurate and complete information. Although there has been sporadic fire from unknown sources at aircraft over-flying the Great Lakes region, including U.S. Navy aircraft, it is not clear that this fire was intentionally directed at U.S.  personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This past weekend the United States also deployed an AC-130U aircraft to the area to facilitate this effort through the use of aerial surveys.  Although its primary mission is aerial surveys, the aircraft is fully mission- capable and will be available for search and rescue or other force-protection missions, if required. The aircraft will be based in Entebbe Airfield, Uganda, and will conduct aerial surveys throughout the Great Lakes region. The aircraft will remain in the area as long as aerial survey efforts are required by relief efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States recognizes that the return of peace and security to the region will ultimately rest on the resolution of long-standing political and social differences and an end to the fighting. The United States is actively supporting the United Nations and the international community to achieve those ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian concerns, however, require that the United States take immediate action to relieve the suffering of innocent victims of the regional instability until those long-term political and social differences can be resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have taken this action pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. I am providing this report in accordance with my desire that the Congress be fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution. I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action to assist the international community in its humanitarian relief efforts in Central Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is deeply concerned about allegations of human rights abuses in eastern Zaire by elements of the rebel alliance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, there have been reports by refugees repatriating at Gisenyi of killings by rebel forces in northern Zaire, allegations of slayings of refugees in the southwestern part of rebel-held territory, and rumors of executions of Zairian officials in Bukavu, as well as allegations that returning young male refugees are separated before reaching the border, and disappear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We call on rebel leaders to act immediately to investigate all reports of human rights abuses, halt any ongoing abuses uncovered, and bring to justice those responsible. Finally, we urge all parties to allow the international community open access to eastern Zaire immediately so that these charges might be investigated directly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States welcomes the beginning of disarmament of the factions in Liberia's civil war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surrender of arms, which began November 22 in accordance with the Abuja Peace Accord, is an important step forward.  Disarmament is the cornerstone of the peace process and the key to ending Liberia's nearly seven-year civil war. The United States commends the leadership, performance and commitment of the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, in beginning the disarmament exercise. The United States calls on all factions and their leaders to continue on the path to peace at this critical moment in Liberia's history. We urge the factions to disarm fully and quickly, even before the January 31, 1997, deadline set in the amended Abuja Accord.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Text of remarks, as prepared for delivery, by Richard Bogosian, State Department coordinator for Rwanda and Burundi, before the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights of the House of Representatives Committee on International Relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the situation in the Great Lakes Region with you. The fast changing events in the region caused by the sudden exodus of refugees to Rwanda has shifted the center of gravity from concern over the refugee situation to the crisis in Zaire itself. The turmoil in eastern Zaire is both a product of years of neglect by the central government and the destabilizing effect of the former Rwandan Army and government-in- exile accompanied by a million refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RWANDA: POLITICAL SITUATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairian rebel advances have released refugees from the grip of the former Rwandan Army and Hutu militias (ex-FAR and Interahamwe). The estimated 600, 000 refugees from eastern Zaire have returned to their home communes relatively peacefully. A Rwandan Government (GOR) no-arrest policy has been in effect with the exception of some notorious alleged genocidists who the government claims would be attacked if left in the community. Ex-FAR have been given identity cards and remain at large in view of chronic prison overcrowding. Rwanda is expecting the imminent return of the estimated 535, 000 refugees from Tanzania, who have also been intimidated about returning home. The GOR is operating under the premise that Rwanda's security is less threatened by opposition inside the country than from across the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan Government remains wary of foreign intervention. It has, however, agreed bilaterally to give certain U.S. military personnel the same immunities and privileges as &quot;experts&quot; under our technical cooperation agreement. Rwanda is reluctant to agree to a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) for a Multinational Force, lacking a defined mission or clear rules of engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our principal objective in Rwanda remains to assist the government in making peace with its neighbors, reabsorbing refugees, and the reconstruction of civil society, as well as contributing to rebuilding a justice system that will help Rwandans cope with the past and adapt to the enormous challenges of political reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORS IN RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) currently has 107 Human Rights Monitors in Rwanda, at an annual cost of about $12 million. The monitors are stationed throughout the country and maintain regular relations with provincial government authorities and military units. They visit prisons, make regular trips through their provinces, organize human rights awareness meetings in local communities, and regularly file reports with the Human Rights Field Operation in Kigali. If human rights violations are discovered, the HRFOR raises them directly at a high level with the Rwandan authorities.  The government has transferred military officers and brought others before military courts for such violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the recent influx of refugees, the Human Rights Monitors have played an important role in monitoring the conduct of Rwandan Army (RPA) troops along the return routes. They have reported very few violations, indicating the Monitors' effectiveness or the discipline of the RPA, or both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The High Commissioner for Human Rights plans to deploy an additional 27 monitors to Rwanda by December 8, and 30 to 40 more by Christmas to deal with the immediate crisis. The High Commissioner hopes to have a total of 300 monitors in Rwanda by mid-1997, at a total annual cost of $30 million. The additional monitors are needed because the returning refugees include many who may have participated in the 1994 genocide, increasing the potential for ethnic tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the $3 million the USG has contributed to the HRFOR in 1995 and 1996, the U.S. has pledged $500,000 toward support of the additional monitors, to be paid upon passage of the 15-day congressional notification period for reprogramming ESF funds. Eight million dollars has been pledged by European donors for the HRFOR in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EASTERN ZAIRE: POLITICAL/SECURITY SITUATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the refugees have returned into Rwanda or have fled deeper into the interior of Zaire, the rebel alliance now claims to be focusing on a broader agenda to wrest political power from Zairian President Mobutu. Their capability to do so is uncertain and we remain deeply concerned about instability or worse in Zaire. The alliance has allowed humanitarian organizations access to eastern Zaire under controlled conditions. It has only agreed to allow a handful of military personnel -- U.S. or Canadians -- to assess humanitarian needs in the area under their control and has made it clear it would resist Multinational Force (MNF) intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ugandan government reportedly sent troops into Zairian territory last weekend to the town of Kasinde, which has effectively secured Uganda's border from Lake Edward to Lake Albert. About 100 missionaries, many of them Americans, have just evacuated Rethi near the Ugandan border, because of the conflict in the area. We are pressing the Ugandans to restrain their forces, even in the face of possible provocation by Uganda rebels operating from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are deeply concerned about reports of human rights abuses in eastern Zaire by elements of the rebel alliance. Refugees repatriating at Gisenyi tell of killings by alliance forces of military-age refugees in the southwestern part of alliance-held territory. Reports from Bukavu allege executions of government officials there. Limited access to some parts of eastern Zaire makes these allegations difficult to substantiate, but we have sent a strong signal to the alliance that it must exert discipline and bring a halt to any such human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZAIRE POLITICAL SITUATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crisis in the Kivus has emerged against a backdrop of Zaire's difficult political transition to a post-Mobutu era. President Mobutu remains in France recovering from surgery. His health and his return to Zaire remain uncertain.  Though far away, Mobutu still plays an important role. A succession of Zairian and international figures continues to seek him out in Nice.  Political posturing and maneuvering continue in Kinshasa. Last week, after a meeting with Mobutu, opposition leader Tshisekedi announced he had a mandate to form a government of National Unity. This was disavowed by close advisers of Mobutu and denounced by Prime Minister Kengo, who remains in charge of the government and has been doing a fairly good job under difficult circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FAZ -- the Zairian Army -- has been thoroughly discredited in eastern Zaire, having fled in the face of rebel attacks. Tension is rife in Kisangani, almost 500 km west of Goma, where the FAZ is regrouping. Some reshuffling has taken place in the FAZ leadership and the army has vowed to retake the Kivus. Generals still could play a role in the future political dispensation in Zaire. As the Zairian Government (GOZ) rankles at Ugandan and Rwandan border incursions, there are reports that the GOZ may be seeking to hire foreign mercenaries to help the Zairian military. The unstable security situation in the East could be prolonged and further deteriorate should the Zairian authorities mount a counterattack to dislodge the rebels or if the rebels continue their advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The democratic transition, with elections scheduled for mid 1997, is at risk of further significant delays as a result of the security situation in the Kivus. It is likely local political leaders will resist proceeding with the elections until central government authority is established in eastern Zaire. We can expect key reform-minded leaders to devote less attention and political capital to maintaining the elections on schedule. More money will go to buy military equipment, less to support elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. policy is to promote a cessation of hostilities between Zaire and the alliance and assist the repatriation of all remaining Rwandan refugees. We recognize Zaire's sovereignty and territorial integrity and urge keeping the democratic transition on track, including granting citizenship to the Banyamulenge and their inclusion, with other rebels, in the political process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire remains opposed to an MNF headquarters in Uganda; instead it favors direct MNF intervention in the Kivus to restore eventually Zairian control of the region. Zaire took strong exception to U.S. and Canadian officials meeting with rebel leader Laurent Kabila, as we sought access for aid agencies and survey teams to determine the location and conditions of refugees in the East. Likewise it opposes the concept of airdrops as &quot; undignified,&quot; but wants humanitarian aid to flow from the West toward the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BURUNDI: POLITICAL SITUATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the situation in Burundi has been overshadowed by events in eastern Zaire, the fundamental problems remain. The Tutsi-led self-proclaimed interim government remains in conflict with the predominantly Hutu National Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD), a conflict whose main victims continue to be innocent civilians. Both sides are guilty of human rights abuses, although recent reports implicate the Armed Forces of Burundi (FAB) in recent gross human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our goals remain the same: a negotiated cease-fire followed by talks aimed at the restoration of constitutional government. The regional states have imposed economic sanctions on Burundi although their effect has diminished since the July 26 coup. Our position remains that sanctions again the Buyoya government need to be calibrated to the progress made towards the goals set forth in the latest Arusha communique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Buyoya camp has made some progress in partially unmanning political parties and allowing the National Assembly to meet, there is no climate inside Burundi for the conduct of free political activity. The president of the National Assembly continues to be harassed and has been denied permission to travel overseas. President Ntibantunganya has been in our ambassador's residence since before the July 26 coup. We do not believe that the present authorities are capable of ensuring his security nor will they allow him to depart the country immediately and unconditionally ..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MULTINATIONAL FORCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration supports the Canadian proposal to establish the multinational headquarters for a humanitarian mission to Central Africa with a watching brief on eastern Zaire. The MNF mission under UNSCR 1080 was to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the return of refugees to Rwanda. Given the mass repatriation of refugees last month and the scattering of those remaining, the scope of the mission has become substantially more limited than originally contemplated. Canada has established the rear MFN headquarters in Stuttgart and is in the process of setting up the main command post in Entebbe, Uganda. The small U.S. task force in Kigali has just relocated to Entebbe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are in close consultations with Canada on planning for airdrops to vulnerable groups; final approval of airdrops would require a consensus agreement by the MFN Steering Board. Lacking agreement from the Zairian government and rebel leader Kabila, airdrops remain problematic. Kabila is reserving agreement until he is informed of a large concentration of refugees in need. There is concern that relief supplies would fall into the hands of the FAR/Interahamwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We remain open-minded to an MNF operation with a clearly defined mission.  On the other hand, we do not want to commit to an operation without knowing, for example, the whereabouts of the target population, for the sake of &quot;doing something.&quot; Resolving Zaire's internal conflicts requires attention, but it falls outside the mandate of UNSCR 1080.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various initiatives are being explored to resolve conflicts in Central Africa and mitigate the social, political, and environmental impact of such conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The U.N. Secretary-General's) Special Envoy Chretien has just spent four weeks in the region seeking solutions. He will submit his recommendations to the (U.N. Secretary-General) next week. I have recently returned from Rwanda, where I was in close touch with (the) Rwandan Government and also met with rebel leaders in an effort to get access and safe passage for relief agencies to reach refugees in eastern Zaire. The parties all committed to providing access. Special Envoy Wolpe has also been in the region, attending the Nairobi Summit and presenting U.S. positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African initiatives include a conference on the situation in Zaire/Rwanda called by Congolese President Lissouba in Brazzaville this week, which provided an opportunity for high-level Rwandan and Zairian contact. Both Zairian PM Kengo and Rwandan PM Rwigema will be attending the Ouagadougou Franco-African Summit December 4-6. With strong support from OAU Chairman Biya, Kenyan President Moi is setting up a Nairobi II conference of regional leaders later this month to seek solutions to regional conflicts. It is important to get the government in Kinshasa and the rebel alliance talking to each other to find political solutions to their problems. We are trying to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We support the French and other nations' call for a well-prepared U.N./OAU- endorsed diplomatic conference to resolve the myriad political, refugee, security, and other problems facing Rwanda, Burundi, and their neighbors. One long-term result of the current crisis in eastern Zaire is a heightened awareness of the need to put in place conflict response mechanisms such as the U.S.-proposed African Crisis Response Force (ACRF). At the recent OSCE Summit in Lisbon, Canadian Prime Minister Chretien told leaders from 50 nations that the international community had shown it was willing to cooperate on the eastern Zaire crisis but needed to be prodded by a more solid framework for reaction. We believe the ACRF proposal would provide a solid alternative to ad hoc solutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The survival of 50 passengers from the crashed airlines flight ET 961 is a proof to the calibre and efficiency of the ETHIOPIAN and its pilots, winning the admiration of papers around the world as one of Africa's most respected airlines, General manager Ahmed Kello said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It takes an extraordinary talent to save lives while receiving punches under threats of all sorts by the hijackers forcing the airbus to divert to Australia even after being told that it has ran out of fuel,&quot; Dr. Ahmed told journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier last week, Captain Leul, the pilot of the hijacked airliner said: &quot; I have tried to exploit my know-how and experience. I have nothing to regret about&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ETHIOPIAN has as usual continued its international flights after the disaster with no looked passenger cancelling his/her flights, the General Manager of the airlines said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airlines has build up its reputation, free of technical failures, constraints common among many of the airlines, flying wide as one of the safest in Africa, he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Ahmed said: &quot;This accident was not brought about by Ethiopian Airlines as such and it does not call the safety record of the airline into question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Vision, a Kenya newspaper, in its Nov. 26 issue said: &quot;The African airline Association defended Ethiopian Airlines, arguing the crash had nothing to do with its safety record&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline flies to 40 cities located in Africa, the Middles East and Asia in addition to the 40 destinations in its domestic flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to its objective &quot;Bringing Africa Together,&quot; ETHIOPIAN has over two third of its flight routes in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among its destinations are included Abidjan, Accra, Athens, Beijing, Cairo, London, Frankfurt, Rome and New Delhi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highly modern aircraft maintenance centre has helped the EAL to become one of Africa's most respected airlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre, with 1,400 ground technicians, is recognised by the US Federal Aviation Administration, the British Civil Aviation authority and aviation supervision agencies in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the airlines Sunday said identification of crash victims is well underway and the corpses will be delivered to their families in a week's time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a telephone interview with the Ethiopian News Agency head of the ETHIOPIAN Medical Department Dr. Ayinalem GebreMariam who is presently in the Comoros said the medical team dispatched to the Comoros is engaged in identifying and preparing the bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the delay in evacuating the corpses, he said &quot;we were first preoccupied with recovering the bodies from the wreckage, which have to be identified and this has taken time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further said the process of identifying the corpses from such a place crash with documents like passports and identification cards mission is a painstaking job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absence of experts at the crash site has complicated the identification process, he said and mentioned that the airlines has employed additional foreign experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Identification demands patience and is time consuming as it includes cross- checking of personal data obtained from families with marks on the bodies, documents and cloths the victims have present at the prayer service, has also laid wreaths, the radio it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to latest information obtained from the EAL, bodies of 40 victims of the air crash will arrive here tomorrow morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the spokesman of the ETHIOPIAN, the corpses have passed through the identification process being carried out in the Comoros by experts the airlines has deployed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman urged the five persons from each family of the deceased to granted permission, to appear at bole International Airport at 8 a.m. tomorrow and identify the bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extreme care taken in identifying and preparing the corpses was also meant to fulfill requirements in line with regulations pertaining to life insurance, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be a special reception ceremony at the airport organised by the Ethiopian government, he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe on Wednesday conceded his country's doctors are poorly remunerated but said sick patients should not be used as sacrificial lambs in bargaining for higher wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officially opening the 47th annual general meeting and scientific conference of the association of surgeons of east and central africa (Asea), Mugabe said doctors should not be allowed to go hungry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is good cause in our circumstances of developing countries for surgeons to appeal, request and demand the most of comfort which will enable them to operate effectively. they should not be allowed to go hungry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our doctors are not well salaried and we should take care of them if they are going to take care of us well,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said the recent strike involving some junior doctors and nurses showed lack of concern for human life in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Surely it can never be right to use the sick patient as our sacrificial lamb in bargaining for higher wages. The medical profession's first responsibility is to serve as a trusted agent of and adviser of patients,&quot; said Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Junior doctors and nurses in Zimbabwe went on strike on Oct. 21 to press government for a general improvement on their conditions of service and an increase in various allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The striking nurses and doctors have since been dismissed, forcing the closure of some wards in major referral hospitals in Harare and Bulawayo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ASEA incoming chairman, Prof. Ignatius Kakande of Uganda's Makerere university, said the relationship between doctors and money was complicated and intricate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The relationship has been represented by triumphant aesculapius who appears as an angel when attending a patient, as a god when he cures and as a devil when he asks for payment for his professional fee,&quot; said Kakane, who took over from Prof. Josephat Mulimba of Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the fact that medical practice is an integral interpersonal relationship between the patient, the society in which we live and the doctor himself, the patient and society have also a duty to ensure that the doctor is facilitated to be able to perform his work efficiently and in peace of mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A hungry doctor is unlikely to perform his duties perfectly. however, since the health of the man is priceless, the surgeon should only demand for his efforts a payment which is adequate and suitable to his personal and family needs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said payment should never be so high as to cancel or neutralize the feeling of gratitude and the spiritual link which should be existing between the patient and his surgeon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The profession should not be turned into a market reality causing its dehumanization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association is composed of seven countries - Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof. Godfrey Muguti, who is president of the surgical society of Zimbabwe, said the annual meeting of the association provided a forum for members to discuss issues of mutual concern and share experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's Bonnie Mauchaza was chosen to be vice-president of the association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 150 delegates from member countries are attending the meeting which ends on Friday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Maputo daily newspaper, Noticias, reported Wednesday that the presiding judge of the Manica provincial court, Valentim Sambo, murdered the servant, only named as Joao, on Nov. 7, according to the provincial attorney's office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The office said the body of the dead man has not yet been found, but there are &quot;credible reports&quot; that it may have been buried or dumped somewhere in the districts of Gondola or Sussundenga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manica provincial attorney, Daniel Magula, told the press that investigations had brought to light evidence that Sambo did indeed murder his servant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the investigations we have carried out, involving the competent authorities and statements from relatives and neighbors, there is no doubt that the judge killed the deceased,&quot; he added. &quot;Whether he has hidden the body is irrelevant. What is relevant for us is that we have sufficient evidence to assert that the person was killed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magula expressed concern over the supreme court's delay in taking action.  Despite pressure from the attorney general's office, the supreme court has not yet suspended the judge. Almost a month after the servant's death, Sambo is still in full power as the Manica presiding judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a fight going on in Maputo between the attorney general's office and the supreme court, while the accused remains unpunished&quot;, accused Magula.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alemayehu and Matias were said to be high school drop-outs, while Sultan Nuru Hussein had completed training as a nurse in Djibouti. All three were unemployed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomsa Ncube, a female lawyer in Bulawayo, said cases of juvenile rape had increased by over 100 percent since 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Traditional healers should be responsible, they are prescribing rapes of small children,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a member of the Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers Association (Zinatha), Lettie Moyo, denied knowledge of such practices. She said that traditional healers who made such prescriptions were not genuine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to regional court records, 90 rape cases were heard between January and November 1995. However during the same period in 1996, 350 cases went through the same court over the same, 90 percent of them involving children under the age of 16 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ncube said more cases were awaiting trial while others had gone unreported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This could just be the tip of the iceberg,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Employees who live with the HIV virus that causes the incurable AIDS face a precarious life in Cote d'Ivoire where tales of mounting discrimination against such workers have just emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a document obtained by PANA in Dakar, the discrimination is practiced under the collusion of employers, trade union officials as well as doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This type of exclusion, in Abidjan, the country's business capital, was revealed in a paper presented at a recent international symposium on Social Sciences and AIDS in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gathering, held from Nov.4-8 in Sali Portudal, Senegal, was sponsored by the French Overseas Organization for Scientific Research (ORSTOM) and the Dakar-based Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the paper's author, Laurent Aventin of ORSTOM, the discriminatory practices include the illicit testing for HIV and abusive job dismissals. He wrote that these practices &quot;probably&quot; exist in other West African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Health Organization statistics indicate that Cote d'Ivoire leads other West African countries in terms of HIV seropositivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As at May 31, 1995, Aventin wrote, Cote d'Ivoire had reported 25,236 cases of full-blown AIDS. The general seropositivity rate is currently estimated at 13.7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He found that employers engage in discrimination against HIV infected people to guard their firms against absenteeism or AIDS-related deaths among their workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his paper, Vantin says the root cause of the discrimination lies in the non-respect of the medical secret by the various AIDS-testing centers in Abidjan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This lack of confidentiality, the document notes, arises from the fact that only between five and six doctors possess specialized certificates in occupational health studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, most the occupation health matters is handled by doctors who reveal the HIV status of workers to the people who employ them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ORSTOM document quoted a study by a female medical student who discovered that out of about 30 doctors employed by firms, 30 percent confirmed passing the results of their tests to employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employers also get information about workers from hospitals, testing centers and the blood transfusion center. The practice of pre-employment testing is also mentioned in the ORSTOM study, although the Ivorian legislation does not demand for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once an employee has been identified to be living with HIV, some managers in Abidjan negotiated for his or her voluntary retirement, sometimes using some trade union leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other employers look for faults by the seropositive worker so as to eventually legally sack him or her on the basis of those mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his conclusion, Aventin makes an urgent appeal on Ivorian work places to stress on AIDS information and education to dispel the existing myths about the disease as well as its modes of transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also stresses the need to sensitize labor inspectors so that they can mete out punishment to discourage the ongoing discriminatory practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The author further urges the Board of the Cote d'Ivoire Medical Order as well as the country's juridical organs &quot;to play a role of prevention, surveillance and punishment especially in situation of non-respect of the medical secret.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United Nations (PANA) - UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros- Ghali has no objections to other African candidates vying for the job he occupies, his spokeswoman said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's always been an open question that anybody can submit their own names to the Security Council,&quot; spokeswoman Sylvana Foa told UN correspondents in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foa was reacting to a letter from the chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), president Paul Biya of Cameroon, urging interested African states to nominate other suitable candidates for the post, in addition to Boutros-Ghali.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that Biya's letter did not represent a shift in the position of the OAU, which endorsed Boutros-Ghali for a second five-year term at its last summit in Yaounde last July. His current term will expire on Dec. 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He (OAU chairman) is asking other heads of state within the OAU for their views on his proposal that other African countries be allowed to submit names directly to the Security Council while reaffirming that Boutros-Ghali is a candidate of the OAU,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the U.S., which is opposed to another term for the secretary- general, interpreted the letter to mean that Africa has abandoned Boutros- Ghali and urged other African candidates to come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were very pleased with the letter from president Paul Biya because in effect it now allows the Security Council to do its work,&quot; U.S. ambassador Madeleine Albright said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It broke the logjam and we think now that we'll be getting names of African candidates,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council members have agreed to give priority to African candidates to ensure that Africa gets a second mandate like other regions which had produced a secretary-general in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process of selecting a candidate to be elected by the 185-members General Assembly has been on hold since Nov. 19, when the U.S. vetoed the candidature of Boutros-Ghali, who received the support of the 14 other members of the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the letter, the African group at the UN had consistently said that it was sticking by the secretary-general pending further instructions from the African leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, after a three-hour closed-door meeting in New York Friday, reaffirmed its backing for Boutros-Ghali, in spite of Biya's letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though no other candidate has emerged so far, several possible candidates, including the OAU secretary-general, Salim Ahmed Salim, the head of the International Peace Academy in New York, Olara Otunnu of Uganda and the UN under-secretary for peacekeeping operations, Kofi Annan of Ghana, are being mentioned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe's education minister, Edmund Garwe, resigned Thursday, two days after admitting his 14-year-old daughter was responsible for the leak of a Zimbabwe Junior Certificate (ZJC) examination paper at the Dominican convent high school in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing what he said was the &quot;shame and tarnish&quot; that the leak caused, Garwe said he had requested President Robert Mugabe to relieve him of his post to which he was appointed six months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it was only honorable for me to take this course,&quot; he said and stressed that it was a sole decision which he made on Wednesday night and no pressure had been brought to bear on him from any quarter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garwe's resignation became the second incident since independence in April 1980 that a minister has left cabinet voluntarily after being involved in a scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first incidence, three ministers resigned in 1989 after being implicated in scandal involving the abuse of a facility to acquire scarce new vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garwe accepted that his resignation was necessary to save the integrity of the country's schools examinations, some of which were now being localized from British universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Professionally, there's no other way,&quot; he said. &quot;Even if it were not the exams, I...would have taken that course of action. But the question of exams is very important because we are going to localize these exams.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Garwe admitted in an interview that his daughter had accessed a ZJC examination paper which he had taken home after a meeting to discuss printing errors in the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the leak was discovered, he voluntarily withdrew the girl from sitting the examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made a public apology which he also repeated on Thursday, saying he deeply regretted the sham and tarnish the leak had caused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admitted that the pressure on his family was unbearable and that his daughter had been most remorseful and had to be put under guard to prevent her from committing suicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garwe is a former envoy to Nairobi and Washington, chief of protocol in the president's office and governor for Mashonaland east province before his appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about his future plans, he said: &quot;I will remain a member of parliament. I think I will survive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said after he came out in the open about the leak, he had received overwhelming expressions of sympathy from the public although there had been others who called to say &quot;we got you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of them had racial overtones,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The South African President Nelson Mandela will Tuesday sign into law his country's long-awaited post-apartheid constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The signing ceremony will coincide with the International Human Rights day, which is annually observed on Dec. 10.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows the order by the Constitutional Court Wednesday that the final constitution may now be certified, after amendments on the original text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela said the court's judgement signalled the end of a chapter which had been started under the most trying times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hailed the constitution as &quot;a fitting tribute to the sons and daughters of our land, from all political parties, who contributed in making every South African a signatory to this magnificent piece of history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For me personally,&quot; said Mandela, &quot;it brings the satisfaction of witnessing the irony of the summation of a democratization process which commenced under the most restrictive conditions -- in prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his judgement, with which all 11 constitutional court judges concurred, Constitutional Court President Arthur Chaskalson said the Constitutional Assembly's amended draft met all 34 constitutional principles contained in the interim constitution, and so could be certified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally, on Sept. 6, the Court had sent back the Constitutional Assembly's first draft after rejecting certain aspects. The Assembly finalized its amendments and presented the new draft in November.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the ban, the chief said these night ceremonies were boosting criminal activities in the area including mugging, robbery, rape, adultery and sexual frolics, which was promoting AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, (PANA) - Retired Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere on Wednesday blamed the Zairian government for causing the latest crisis in the Great Lakes region by seeking to expel the ethnic Rwandans who have lived within its territory for centuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in New York, at a roundtable organized by the International Peace Academy, Nyerere said that the ethnic Rwandans, called the 'Banyamulenges', had been living in eastern Zaire since the time that region was a part of Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have always been there before the partitioning (by colonialist powers- Germany and Belgium),&quot; he told an audience of UN ambassadors, representatives of UN agencies as well as journalists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No government has a right to deny them their right of citizenship&quot;, said Nyerere, who has been the chairman of the south center since 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the Banyamulenges, as well as another group of Rwandans who were recruited by the Belgians to work for them in Zaire decades ago, were Zairians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can't go back to Rwanda...they don't know where their ancestors came from,&quot; Nyerere said, adding: &quot;Zaire is a huge country, it can absorb them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ethnic Rwandan Tutsis, joined by other discontented groups in the region, have been fighting the Zairian forces since October, forcing the 1.2 million mostly Rwandan refugees in the area out of their camps and creating a humanitarian nightmare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 500,000 of the refugees have since returned to Rwanda, with an estimated 750,000 others still scattered in the hills around the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former president said that the priority of the international force that had been approved by the Security Council for the region should be to help the refugees, most of whom are Hutu who fled Rwanda after the 1994 massacre, to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most important job for the international community is to help the refugees to go back,&quot; he said &quot;as long as they are in Zaire, they will constitute a potential security problem between the two countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Burundi, where he has been facilitating peace talks, the Nyerere said that only negotiations between the government and the Hutu opposition group could end the crisis in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere, who led his country from 1961 to 1985, warned that the economic sanctions imposed on Burundi following Maj. Pierre Buyoya's military coup on July 25, would continue unless the minority Tutsis conduct &quot;serious negotiations&quot; with the majority Hutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As soon as it is quite clear that they are willing to talk, I will be talking to the east African leaders about relaxing the sanctions,&quot; he said. &quot; I don't like sanctions at all&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi's ambassador to the UN, Terence Nsanze, who attended the session, had said that the sanctions were hurting the country's economy and urged the leaders to lift them immediately to alleviate the suffering of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In introductory remarks, the president of the New York-based International Peace Academy, Olara Otunnu, said that the roundtable, on the theme &quot; Responding to the growing crisis in the Great Lakes Region,&quot; was part of activities marking the 26th anniversary of the academy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - About 9.3 million Ghanaians go the polls on Saturday to vote for a President and 200 members of parliament in the second general elections since the inception of the Fourth Republic on Jan.7, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elections mark the first time in 30 years that a constitutional government will have served its first full term in office and the electorate offered the opportunity to decide on who rules the country. All the previous attempts at constitutional rule were cut short by military coups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The electorate will choose from three presidential candidates and 739 parliamentary candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those vying for the presidency are the incumbent, President Jerry John Rawlings, 49, whose National Democratic Congress (NDC) swept the polls in 1992 in an alliance with the EGLE Party and the National Convention Party (NCP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time the Progressive Alliance, as the party of the president is known, includes the Democratic Peoples Party (DPP) following the withdrawal of the NCP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former boss of the Internal Revenue Service, Professor Joseph Evans Atta Mills, is running-mate of Rawlings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Agyekum Kufuor, 58, is presidential candidate of the Great Alliance which comprises his New Patriotic Party (NPP) and People's Convention Party (PCP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer and politician, Kufuor's chances seem to have been enhanced by the alliance with the PCP, a long-time political rival of the NPP. By that deal Kow Nkensen Arkaah, the estranged vice-president, is Kufuor's running-mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third Presidential candidate is Dr Edward Mahama, 51, a medical doctor, who will be contesting on the ticket of the People's National Convention (PNC) which was founded by former President Hilla Limann.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Dedo Mate, a broadcaster who was deputy minister of Health in Limann's government, is Mahama's running-mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Electoral Commission (EC) has distributed 40,000 transparent boxes and about 10 million ballot papers to the constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, 136,000 agents of candidates will be manning the 20,000 polling centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observer missions including those from the United Nations, the Commonwealth, the U.S-based National Democratic Institute, OAU and about 5,000 local ones will be monitoring the elections. John Larvie, Public Relations Officer of the EC, said that full results could be known within 72 hours of the close of polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hopefully, by midnight of the seventh, we would have known about half of the total results,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected that the election will be a straight fight between Rawlings and Kufuor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A winner will have to win over 50 percent of the total ballots cast. Should any of the candidates fail to make that mark, a second ballot between the two top candidates will be held on Dec. 28, the EC said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As members of the Commonwealth, British nationals did not require a visa to enter Zambia. But last week Lusaka imposed the visa requirement as a retaliatory measure when London issued an order requiring Zambians to obtain visas to enter Britain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines made a staggering loss on both sales of copper and cobalt resulting in a combined operating loss of K55, 539 million for the quarter ending September 30, 1996 against a profit of K40, 744 million in the corresponding quarter of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major loss has resulted in the Board of Directors not declaring a dividend in respect of the quarter ended September 30 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement issued by the company in Lusaka says the average sales realisation at K2.032 million per tonne for copper was 23 percent lower than the K2.649 million per tonne realised in the corresponding quarter of 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means that total sales revenue for the quarter was K290, 125 million against K397, 364 million achieved in September 1995 representing a decrease of 27 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales from the ZCCM production amounted to 73, 575 tonnnes against 79,414 tonnes sold during the same and this represented a deficit of 5, 839 tonnes.  Much of the problem has been placed by the company on troubles experienced by Tanzania-Zambia railway line which included a prolonged strike by workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales, including metal bought-in, were 94, 292 tonnes for the qurter compared with 133, 305 tonnes in the corresponding period of the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand cobalt production at 1, 155 tonnes for the quarters was 73 percent higher than the 667 tonnes produced in the corresponding quarter of the previous year due to the availability of high grade Nchanga cobalt concentrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales of coabalt at 1146 tonnes were also 125 percent higher than the 509 tonnes sold in the same period of 1995 reflecting improved demand for the metal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly the company chalked up results in revenue from sales of precious metals which amounted to K1, 491 million during the quarter, compared to sales of K448 million during the same period of 1995.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambian parliament starts its five-year journey tomorrow, December 6, following the controversial elections of November 18 which saw the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy returned to office with a resounding majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clerk of the National Assembly, Mwelwa Chibesakunda, gave out notification of the date last week and since Monday the new Members of Parliament have been milling around parliament motel for their registration, identity cards and other vital procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new national assembly, which is the second under resurrected multi- party rule, has by far the biggest number of political parties represented since Zambia gained political independence from colonial master, United Kingdom of Queen Elizabeth the second on 24 October 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other than the ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy, which has 129 seats in the new assembly, the National Party too is represented with five seats and the Zambia Democratic Congress and newly formed Agenda for Zambia each of which has two seats in the assembly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are also the independents, the ambitious politicians who defied their parties and stood for votes on their own 'recognisance' and who represent political inclinations ranging from MMD down to United National Independence Party, who in their wisdom had decided to boycott the November 18 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the combined total of these interest groups, which are against the MMD, is still less potent than it was in 1991 when there was only UNIP in opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That time UNIP had 27 seats in parliament when parliament met for first business on 19 November 1991 against 123 seats for the MMD. Two years later oppositon seats rose to 32 after National Party picked five seats from the by- elections which followed its formation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by October this year when elections were being announced there were only about 30 seats in opposition hands after the see-saw competition for seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political pundits in Lusaka are convinced that the total number of seats in political hands and those of the independents would have been higher had opposition UNIP not listened to the out-dated strategies of its leader, Dr Kenneth Kaunda, that they boycott elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With UNIP fielding candidates at least for the position of Member of Parliament it is assumed that many of the seats which the party had clung to over the past five years would have been returned to its grip while others which went the way of the ruling party could have gone to its collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the pressing business to be resolved tomorrow is the administration of the oath of office on all MPs. Then this will be followed by the election of the Speaker of the National Assembly who is the de facto president of the institution and his deputy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter the MPs will be divided into their respective committees - each of which will take care of affairs of state. The new MPs will also be given some lessons on how they are expected to conduct themselves whilst in boundaries of parliament and at their living quarters - Parliament Motel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that they may break up for Christmas and the New Year holidays before reconvening for serious business in the New Year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the National Assembly meets tomorrow it will be doing so with a down cast face following the death of Itezhi-tezhi Member of Parliament, Dr Lumizu Shimaponda, who died in a South African hospital after an illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assembly will also be wondering which way the altercation over whether Zambia Democratic Congress should surrender its hard won seats in Western Province or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incumbent Members of parliament for ZDC, party vice-president Dr Kasuka Mutukwa and Mr Walusiku Situmbeko of Nalolo and Nalikwanda seats respectively are adamant that they cannot surrender the seats on moral grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, they argue, they were voted in all fairness and to deprive the people of these two areas out of childish party stands will be detrimental to the very foundations of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is therefore totally unacceptable and extremely dictatorial for any party member or a clique in the leadership of our democratic party to force eleceted MPs to abandon the people of Nalolo and Nalikwanda now or in future,&quot; Dr Mwauluka declared recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC deputy secretary, Azwell Banda, had astounded the nation with his childish declaration that the two MPs should abandon the two seats won in elections because those November 18 elections were allegedly rigged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Electoral Commission has reacted sharply to the decision by the independent newspaper, the Post, to credit unverified material to its name when opportunities were there for the newspaper to publish correct government records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electoral Commission Public Liaison Officer, Differ Mulimba, says there is absolutely no justification for the Post to publish falsified information when accurate figures were available.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He observed that even during the peak electoral period most media organisations had found it necessary to send reporters to the Electoral Commission offices so that they could get first hand receipt of results from the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this way the Post could have had accurate and verified provisional results which could have been supplemented by the actual results which are now on display.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mulimba suggests that political parties which are in doubt together with their candidates and members of the general public can inspect the results from the electoral offices in districts and compare them with those at the Commission's office to prove for themselves that the allegations by the Post were either genuine or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Commission will soon advertise the provisional results of the elections for inspection by political parties, candidates and general members of the public,&quot; he pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mulimba further observed that it had not been one of his organisation's wishes to reply to allegations from the Post on the provisional results of the November 18 presidential and parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He maintained that at no time did the Commission change any results but merely verified them as received from the source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its lead story for Thursday the Post is claiming that the Commission had changed some results to please the government a thing which Mr Mulimba strongly denies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dakar - While this month Taiwan lost the recognition of Africa's most powerful nation, South Africa, Taiwan and mainland China are conducting a diplomatic war not just about powers but numbers, in which the world's weak nations also count. And they are likely to continue to play one China off against the other. They stand to gain millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many nations may think that China's claim to Taiwan is little more than brute expansionism. Yet eager to increase their exports, industrialized countries now recognize China and its huge markets. Not so, however, the 29 mostly impoverished countries of Africa and Central America. They have few exports. For them Taiwan has something more enticing than markets -- money.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1990-95 Taiwan provided $400 million in official overseas development aid, not to mention military assistance, technical cooperation and plenty of unofficial kickbacks. China calls Taiwan attempts to win recognition 'dollar diplomacy.' For Taiwan it says it just wants to be accepted back into United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month saw two fresh blows to Taiwan's diplomatic dream. One, the announcement that the US and China will exchange presidential visits over the next two years. The other, that South Africa, one of Taiwan's oldest supporter (but also Africa's largest exporter) slipped into the China camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight African countries do still recognize Taiwan, some having only switched in recent months. Liberia is one that maintains relations with both Chinas with the various rebel governments each recognizing one or the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Gambia, Chairman Captain Yahya Jammeh recognized Taiwan soon after coming to power in military coup in 1994. In exchange he got funding for his tiny country's revolution, to the tune of $30 million, which is about a third of his government's annual expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, while capitalist governments flirt with communist China, revolutionary governments seeks support from capitalist Taiwan. Taiwan even funded Gambia's new July 22 revolutionary arch, which looks like a throwback from China's cultural revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In nearby Guinea Bissau, the once staunchly Marxist government also recently switched from China to Taiwan but only after dropping most of its ideological rhetoric. In Burkina Faso too, the revolutionary military government only made the switch a few years ago after assassinating its charismatic leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some African countries, trying to cut the best possible deals, have switched sides several times. Earlier this year Senegal flipped back to Taiwan for the third time. Senegalese officials are reported to have received millions of dollars in their foreign bank accounts. The government will also receive at least $50 million for two projects the government had been promising its people for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Senegal and The Gambia the move to Taiwan came at a particularly unfortunate time for China. It had invested heavily in both countries, in each case donating giant sports stadiums just before storming out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Chinese diplomats all left, Chinese business has quietly stayed.  China donated the buildings to gain diplomatically but, at the same time, it also set up commercial construction companies to gain financially as well.  The companies employ mostly low paid Chinese workers and can often outbid African and Western companies. ''They may no longer have diplomatic relations with us but they are winning all the major public and private contracts,'' said an unemployed Senegalese architect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, China has developed its own form of 'dollar diplomacy' and it is effective, particularly with governments of questionable repute like Nigeria, Sudan and Zaire. China is reported to have given a 'gift' of $3.6m to Zaire in September and offered $10 million for a joint mining venture. In Sudan it also announced an investment of $24 million in gold mining, despite UN Security Council sanctions to counter that country's terrorist activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiwan is certainly feeling China's pinch. This year Niger also went back to China after only four years with Taiwan and, according to Andrew Yang of the Taipei-based Chinese Center for Advanced Policy Studies, Botswana and Swaziland, which currently recognize Taiwan, may not do so for long, implying that other African countries may also follow South Africa's lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not all analysts agree. Some even question whether improved ties between Washington and Beijing automatically mean Taiwan's interests will be sacrificed. They say China's president, Jiang Zemin, is so anxious to have a state visit with President Clinton to shore up his standing within the Chinese Communist Party that he will try to reduce conflict with Taiwan for fear of jeopardizing the meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiwanese officials like to point out that the number of countries that recognize it has been growing. In 1971 when Taiwan was first excluded from the UN ''South Africa was the only African country,'' said Hein-Sheng Hsu, a senior Taiwianese official in the Senegalese embassy. ''Yes we have now lost South Africa but there are plenty of other African countries and we fully expect many to look our way,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Hsu claimed that while ''China has markets, Taiwan can show poor countries how to create the exports for those markets,'' pointing out that his country, not China, is what most developing countries hope to emulate.  ''Our technical assistance is far more valuable than markets or money,'' he said, though asked whether these poor countries may go back to China once Taiwan helps them develop, he admitted that ''No man knows what the future holds.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gambia's young president visited Taiwan for the first time this month.  He pledged to strengthen bilateral ties between the two countries while Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, announced further aid packages to The Gambia. President Jammeh, who said that American-style democracy is not suited to African people, also said it is unfair for Taiwan to be excluded from the United Nations because, unlike China, it is ''a model democracy,'' and because it is so willing to assist developing nations build their economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jammeh stressed that his country's friendship with Taiwan is not based on money. &quot;Friendship comes from the bottom of the heart and not from the pocket.  Friendship based on money will be short-lived,&quot; he warned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - Tanzanian authorities late today announced that Rwandan refugees would have to return by the end of this month. The Tanzanians also stated that they would not send anybody back by force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In preparation for a major return of refugees from Tanzania ACT has been propositioning food, plastic sheeting and other relief items along with transport vehicles in Kibungo, Rwanda. ACT/LWF is aiming at being able to assist up to 100.000 returnees in way stations and transit camps in Rwanda across from major refugee camps in Tanzania. Tanzania is currently host to some 530.000 Rwandan refugees (UNHCR figure).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Wednesday UNHCR in Kibungo had registered only 618 returnees from Rwanda but the likelihood of a major return has increased dramatically with the announcement today. &gt;From Tanzania ACT has learned that officials there have been informing the refugees informally about their return for quiet some days already. A cancellation of the &quot;group determination&quot; under which most were automatically regarded as refugees in Tanzania, will probably &quot;trigger&quot; a major return as this will seriously affect the service to the refugees in the camps by UNHCR and NGOs. A large proportion of the refugees now living in Tanzania are from Eastern parts of Rwanda e.g. Kibungo Prefecture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In several parts of Rwanda ACT partners continuously work with facilitating the return of the refugees who have arrived from Zaire. In all together 19 communes of Kibuye, Gitarama, Umutara and Kibungo Prefectures ACT is doing distributions of one months rations of food (maize, peas, biscuits, oil &amp; vegetable seeds) along with plastic mats &amp; sheeting, hoes, blankets, jerrycans, kitchen sets and soap to returnees. In Gitarama ACT is also involved in construction of houses for either refugees or people having to evict homes belonging to returnees. As of today there are 8.000 returnees in Kibuye, 20.000 in Gitarama. Kibungo has seen 4.184 returnees from Zaire apart from the recent Tanzanian arrivals mentioned above. UNHCR reports that 800 refugees returned to Rwanda through Goma Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACT continue relief efforts for Zairian displaced in Kivu Despite press reports to the opposite ACT sources today report the Eastern Zairian town of Kisangani calm. ACT partners there are planning to part take in a larger convoy tomorrow to the town of Lobuto south-east of Kisangani. 25.000 internally displaced Zairians and some Rwandan refugees are assumed to be in and around Lobuto. ACT partners NCA and CEPZa/CELPa is preparing to take food and medicine to Lobuto for immediate emergency work to be implemented now and followed up by further supplies in coming days. Elsewhere in Eastern Zaire the rebel forces apparently are still on the advance. The rebel Alliance claim to have taken Kindu as well as being on the outskirts of Kisangani.  This has not been confirmed by sources on the ground. If they were to take over control of Kindu they would control part of the important Zaire river - a major supply and trade line to Eastern Zaire. Kisangani too would be of major importance - not least from a military and morale point of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACT partners have assessed the situation in and around Bukavu with local churches there and are preparing to step up work for displaced in near future.  One ACT partner is already involved in running a basic health clinic in Bukavu for the local population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Despite rumours that Kindu had fallen to the rebels, residents said yesterday it was still in government hands. According to Reuters, local people described Kindu as a &quot;virtual military fortress&quot; with large numbers of soldiers in town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is speculation that rebels are announcing the capture of towns to throw Zairean troops off balance and frighten them out. ICRC pulled its last two staff members out of Kindu for security reasons yesterday. In a statement, ICRC described the situation as &quot;precarious&quot; and said it had been the only international aid organisation working in the region for weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Displaced Zaireans arriving in Kindu to escape fighting were reported to be in extremely poor health. The statement cited the example of an exhausted nineteen year-old girl who arrived from Bukavu with her six-month old baby too tired to speak and suffering from malaria, dehydration, malnutrition and shock. She had wandered around without help for weeks. The statement also expressed concern over tens of thousands of civilians, displaced people and refugees in the Shabunda area who have been deprived of humantarian assistance for weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in Kisangani is still unclear, but some media reports say the local military authorities have begun disarming soldiers who arrived from the Kivu region. These soldiers have been creating insecurity in the town due to food-related problems. More soldiers are said to be arriving from the direction of Walikale, along with their families, and attempts to disarm the Kivu soldiers appear to be increasing tension in the town. Reports say that until the Kivu soldiers have been definitively disarmed and fed, humanitarian aid in the area risks being looted and security for international staff cannot be assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire has called on the UN to stop what it describes as Uganda's armed incursions into Zairean territory. In a statement to the Security Council, dated 1 December, it accused the Ugandan army of &quot;involvement in the war which Rwanda is imposing on Zaire&quot;. The statement, signed by Zairean deputy premier and Interior Minister Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda, said Ugandan troops entered Zaire on November 30 by way of the Kasindi border point. The incursion followed repeated attacks against Zairean territory by the Ugandans earlier in the year, the statement added. It denied Zaire was backing Ugandan rebels of the Allied Democratic Front (ADF). The statement said that because of its &quot;involvement&quot;, Uganda should be disqualified from serving as a base for the multi-national force (MNF). It urged the Security Council and Secretary-General to take &quot;energetic measures&quot; against Uganda's &quot;incursions&quot;.  In Kinshasa, the authorities have reiterated that the MNF should be stationed on Zairean territory and that any aid flights should go via Kinshasa for reasons of cargo verification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report in the Ugandan 'New Vision' newspaper today said 50 rebels were killed in the mountains of Kasese province during heavy fighting yesterday.  Rebels of the Allied Democratic Front infiltrated from Zaire on Monday night and rampaged through the Kanyansi area, setting houses on fire, the newspaper said. It quoted military sources as saying the rebel &quot;remnants&quot; fled back to Zaire and Ugandan soldiers were conducting mopping up operations. Hundreds of exhausted displaced people trekked to Bwera trading centre, about 10 kms away from Kanyansi, the paper said. Three civilians were reportedly wounded in the crossfire. Five Ugandan soldiers were also injured. Meanwhile, presidential adviser Maj Gen David Tinyefuza resigned over remarks criticising the government's handling of the rebellion in the north, the independent daily 'Monitor' reported today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Special Envoy Raymond Chretien, who met President Mobutu in the south of France yesterday, said the Zairean leader was &quot;the only one who can deal with the situation&quot; in eastern Zaire. According to Chretien, Mobutu himself wanted to return home. &quot;Zaire is ready to play its role again and does not intend to use an 'empty chair' policy, Mr Mobutu has assured me,&quot; Chretien added. He said Mobutu was in charge of all important decisions concerning the country and that the Zairean leader had stated his readiness for talks with Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel leader Laurent Kabila called on Mobutu to resign. In a 27 page open letter, he claimed that the &quot;incompetence&quot; of the Mobutu regime was comparable to &quot;natural disasters such as droughts, floods and earthquakes.&quot; At least the bombing of Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Nazi Germany did not destroy the sociological basis on which their societies were founded, AFP reported him as saying. Meanwhile, the rebels yesterday announced the defection to their side of a senior Zairean officer. According to AFP, rebel security adviser Jean Kabongo said Lt Col Lokilo Nene Boseka had gone over to the rebels and was preparing an appeal to fellow officers to follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are indications that life is inching towards normality in rebel- captured territory. An Associated Press article yesterday spoke of crowded markets, the sale of farm produce and businesses re-opening their doors. The report gave the example of Goma, where there was a &quot;growing sense of optimism&quot; . Water was again being supplied for part of the day and electricity would soon be restored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Franco-African summmit, opening in Burkina Faso today, has prepared a draft declaration on the Great Lakes crisis, although the topic is not officially on the agenda. The declaration stresses the inviolability of Zaire's borders. AFP said the declaration was drafted during 12 hours of preparatory talks late Tuesday which were peppered by charged encounters between the representatives of Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania. A regional meeting in Brazzaville, Congo, on Tuesday appeared to yield few results and was boycotted by both Rwanda and Uganda. A final communique called for lifting regional economic sanctions against Burundi &quot;noting steps taken by the Burundian government towards re-establishing democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu warned that the road ahead would be difficult and that the emphasis now must be on rebuilding Rwanda, both materially and psychologically. In a presidential message, broadcast by Rwandan radio last night, he said there was no alternative to &quot;unity to write our country's history afresh&quot;. Bizimungu announced that committees would be set up at all levels, in which the church would be involved, aimed at reconstructing the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN human rights monitors in Rwanda say they have received reports of Rwandan returnees killing genocide survivors. A UN spokeswoman on Tuesday, quoted by Reuters, said the head of the UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda Javier Zuniga had called for a thorough investigation into the incidents and for follow-up action. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Jose Ayala-Lasso, is due in Kigali today for a three-day mission. So far, some 2,000 ex-soldiers have been registered and 38 people arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UNHCR nutrition survey indicated that the refugees who have returned to Rwanda are generally in good health, but they are worried about food shortages and housing issues. The UNCHR's daily update pointed out that the next harvest will be in February and local authorities are predicting difficulties ahead. A seven-day food ration, which returnees collect after registration, consists of 400 grams of flour, 120 grams of peas or beans, 20 grams of oil, 5 grams of salt and some biscuits. The Rwandan government has offered new plots of land to people who have to leave their houses so that returning owners can move back in, Reuters reported. The authorities have set a 15-day deadline for families to move out after registration by the rightful owners, but the government was due to initiate a housing programme today to lessen the impact. &quot;The aim of the house-building programme is not for people to wait for government to build them houses, but to foster a spirit where people will not leave vulnerable groups stranded on the hillside,&quot; said Christine Umutoni, deputy rehabilitation minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR has urged Rwandan refugees in Tanzania to start making preparations to return home as soon as possible, after the Tanzanian government's demand that they leave the country by the end of the year. The government had informed UNHCR it was confident the refugees could return to their country in safety and that the repatriation would be conducted in an orderly and humane manner under the aegis of the Home Affairs Ministry. WFP said the Tanzanian authorities had begun visiting the camps to inform refugees that repatriation must take place imminently. On Tuesday, over 230 refugees were repatriated to Rwanda, which UNHCR described as the biggest figure in a single day. It said the figure almost equalled the number of returnees for the whole of October.  More refugees were expected to return today. The Rwandan government, in conjunction with UNHCR, was making preparations for the returnees.  Unconfirmed reports cited an NGO as saying yesterday that refugees from the Ngara camps were gathering at the border waiting to cross to Rusomo.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is the prepared text of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for African Affairs Vincent Kern, in testimony December 4 before the House of Representatives Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss the refugee situation in eastern Zaire and Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several weeks of massive refugee repatriation, we see many signs of progress and hope. More than 620,000 Rwandan refugees have returned home over the past month. U.N. humanitarian agencies and NGOs/PVOs are slowly re- establishing their operations in eastern Zaire and now have access to a 70 KM area around Bukavu and 30 KM radius around Goma. Earlier this week, for example, UNHCR organized the successful return of about 15,000 refugees from a remote site north of Bukavu. Nevertheless, after nearly a month of continuous, extensive aerial reconnaissance, we have located three large concentrations of refugees and internally displaced persons that may number up to 240,000. Although we do not have evidence to support it, several international groups insist that an additional 250,000 may be unaccounted for.  We continue to conduct daily reconnaissance missions in a thorough attempt to locate refugee concentrations in eastern Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the humanitarian crisis initially exploded in late October, the United States quickly took the lead and helped to organize an international response.  Our efforts culminated in UNSCR 1080 that authorized the establishment of a multinational force (MNF) with the mission to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the voluntary repatriation of Rwandan refugees and Zairian internally displaced persons. For its part, DoD played an important role. Anticipating a major humanitarian relief operation under UNSCR 1080, we promptly prepositioned assets and personnel to the region in order to establish an airbridge and facilitate repatriation. We quickly initiated extensive aerial reconnaissance and passed this information to locally based humanitarian agencies and to UNHCR. We also quickly deployed to the region our Humanitarian Assistance Survey Team (HAST) from the European Command that immediately engaged regional governments and humanitarian organizations. When the President agreed in principle to participate in the U.  N.-authorized MNF, DoD earmarked units and prepared to dispatch nearly 4,000 soldiers to eastern Zaire in order to secure regional airfields and maintain a humanitarian corridor. Then, we joined military planners from more than twenty-five countries and international organizations at our European Headquarters in Stuttgart last month and developed a general framework for a military concept, a mission statement, and five possible response options to the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday in Ottawa, the Canadians hosted the first meeting of the MNF Political Steering Board. In addition to standing-up the MNF HQ, the Board agreed to include planning for the aerial delivery of emergency humanitarian food supplies, or airdrop, in eastern Zaire as a possible MNF mission. As Secretary Perry stated publicly last week, if airdrops are necessary and if the Steering Board agrees, DoD intends to play a significant role. Some in the international community have expressed doubts about the usefulness of airdrops and urge them only as an absolute last resort. Based on earlier experiences, they indicate that airdrops are inaccurate, present serious physical risks to target populations, and will serve only to strengthen the control of ex-FAR/Interahamwe over vulnerable refugee groups. While we share many of their concerns, DoD is actively looking at the feasibility of performing airdrops as part of our ongoing efforts to support international relief operations in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the MNF Force Commander, Lt. Gen Maurice Baril, consulted with regional governments and received approval to establish his MNF Headquarters in Uganda with a forward Headquarters in Kigali and a rear HQ in Stuttgart.  He is also working with regional governments to obtain a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) and with us and other international troop contributors to develop appropriate rules of engagement (ROE). The Joint Staff has been working actively with the Canadians to develop comprehensive command and control arrangements. While we await a final decision on U.S. military participation, I can assure you that our forces will remain under the command of a senior U.S. military officer. Once Gen. Baril concludes these negotiations, we stand ready to participate in the MNF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, we have 446 personnel in the region, including 328 in Entebbe, 22 in Kigali, and 96 in Mombasa. We have a Joint Task Force headquarters staff, a TALCE, three reconnaissance aircraft, and force protection units in Entebbe; a small forward headquarters, a Civil-Military Operations Center, and a media information team in Kigali; and a TALCE in Mombasa. With an airbridge and civil-military elements in place, our forces are ready to assist with humanitarian relief operations and to fashion a comprehensive media campaign message with UNHCR that will facilitate refugee repatriation and resettlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will continue to consult with Congress as details of the mission are finalized. Pending your questions, I thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The Immigration and Nationality Affairs Department of the Ethiopian Security, Immigration and Refugee Affairs Authority said it gave passports and visa services to over 142,000 Ethiopians last year while the Administration for Refugees and Returnee Affairs revealed that Ethiopia hosts over 375,000 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his report to the House of Peoples' Representatives yesterday, Ato Hailu Berhe, head of the Immigration and Nationality Affairs main department said the efforts of the department during the past years to give efficient service to the public were successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Hailu said 30,000 people on average were given passport and visa service annually during the past regime and the figure reached 170,000 annually in the past five years. He added that it took one to two months for an individual to get passport or visa service during the past regime and such unfavourable working system has now been avoided to the extent that it takes only three days to obtain passport and only one day to obtain visa now provided that the person submitted the required documents.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Hailu told the parliament that his department is giving visa services to 20,000 to 30,000 foreigners and gave new residence permit to 834 people last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, 474 foreigners whose residence permit expired were made to pay fines amounting to about half a million birr by court verdict for illegal movement in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added the department is also giving services to travellers through its newly opened stations at Moyale, Dewele, Zalanbessa, Rama and Humera. The department collected 26.8 million birr from passport and visa services last year, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outdated but still operational nationality and immigration laws issued in 1992 and 1961 E.C. have adversely affected the attempt to render fast services for they do not commensurate with changes witnessed both world wide and at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Administration for Returnees an Refugee Affairs (ARRA) said on its part that Ethiopia currently hosts over 375,000 refugees from neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARRA programme execution and coordination department head, Ato Ayalew Aweke told the House that of the refugees 276,000 are Somalis, over 72,000 Sudanese 18,000 Djiboutians and over 8,000 Kenyans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Ayalew said the expense to host the refugees is fully covered by foreign assistance including the food aid from the World Food Programme and other necessary expense by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said over one million Ethiopians who fled the war during the Derg regime were repatriated since 1991 and were provided with rehabilitation assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, legal experts say the draft proclamation of the federal government on financial administration is instrumental in facilitating revenue collection and utilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a public discussion at the House of Peoples Representatives Monday Woizero Atsde Kidane legal service team leader, in the ministry of Finance, said, the proclamation provides new working system and enables the correct, smooth flow of finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Mesfin Lemma, head of Legal Affairs Bureau in the Office of the Prime Minister, explained about the significant contribution of the proclamation to financial in revenue collection and utilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the proclamation introduces strict control system it will not be an obstacle to financial administration for the proper utilisation of revenues, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversial were articles 49 and 7, sub article 3 of the proclamation to which the experts dedicated more time, it was learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discussion was organised by the Budgetary, Economic and legal Standing Committee of the House.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The November 18 elections have been robbed of legitimacy because of the evidence of rigging which continues to surface, declared Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) vice-chairman, Albert Wood, yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And rigging has at least been proved by the recent evidence produced and published by The Post, observed Father Ignatius Mwebe, secretary general of the Catholic's Zambia Episcopal Conference (ZEC), yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wood, after examining the two voters' cards of a person who voted twice in Lusaka, demanded for a thorough analysis and investigation of the whole electoral process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such revelations give credence to the view that the elections and the electoral process have been robbed of legitimacy,&quot; Wood said in an interview yesterday. &quot;We are not sure whether the case of Zgyambo is an isolated incident or not. If this is a general trend then it is a sad development for our fledgling democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent evidence shows that one Tenson Edson Zgyambo voted at two polling stations in Munali and Mandevu constituencies using two different voters' cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Wood added that the evidence adduced so far clearly shows an element of multiple voting which is contrary to the provisions of the Electoral Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Mwebe, in an interview yesterday said The Post newspaper has at least proved a point with its recent evidence of rigging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The recent evidence which you have brought out, you have at least proved one case of rigging,&quot;Father Mwebe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Christian of Council of Zambia (CCZ) secretary general Reverend Violet Sampa-Bredt refused to look at the cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as CCZ is concerned the issue of elections is a dead one,&quot; she said in an interview yesterday. &quot;We monitored elections in ten polling stations and made our report that the elections were free and fair. The elections issue to us is a closed chapter and we don't want to be drawn into it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Lusaka Province MMD chairman, nominated member of parliament Christopher Chawinga, also said the issue of elections was &quot;out of taste&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why should we keep on talking about something which is already out of taste?&quot; Chawinga asked in an interview last night. &quot;People have already decided. All we want now is progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - No amount of government intimidation or harassment will deter the Committee for Clean Campaign (CCC) from performing its duties, warned the Committee's General Assembly yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CCC General Assembly, which comprises 17 representatives from various Non-Governmental Organisations, among them Women for Change, Women's Lobby, Afronet, NGO Co-ordinating Committee, Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, World Vision International, FODEP, Zambia Youth Federation and Youth Federation for World Peace, in a press statement released in Lusaka yesterday, maintained its support of the verdict on the November 18 presidential and parliamentary elections announced by the Committee's chairman, Ngande Mwanajiti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We shall, thus, not sit back and watch the unnecessary individualisation of decisions which are taken collectively,&quot; the CCC General Assembly statement read in part. &quot;Our verdict on the just ended elections are based on a thorough analysis of the whole electoral process.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Assembly reiterated the Committee's observation that the November elections were fraudulent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the November 18 polling day was very peaceful, the whole electoral process was fraudulent from the very beginning,&quot; the CCC General Assembly maintained, adding: &quot;We will not for a second compromise our position and the internationally recognised principles and democratic ideals for which we stand in exchange for non-harassment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lusaka Province MMD chairman, nominated member of parliament Christopher Chawinga, dismissed CCC's charges that the elections were fraudulent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are now tired with the people claiming that the elections were not free and fair,&quot; Chawinga said in an interview last night. &quot; The people have decided. That is all I can tell CCC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CCC also accused the ruling MMD of abusing the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wish to express our deep concern at the manner in which the ruling party and its reckless cadres are using the police and other security wings of the government to harass perceived political adversaries and those holding opposing views,&quot; the CCC General Assembly charged. &quot;We, therefore, demand an immediate stop to the unwarranted harassment and victimisation of our members.  As part of the civil society, we will continue to speak against acts of oppression and any other forms of injustice that threaten to undermine democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CCC General Assembly complained that the searches of Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) and Inter-Africa Network on Human Rights and Development (AFRONET) offices, the freezing of the CCC bank accounts and the false imprisonment of ZIMT president Alfred Zulu and Mwanajiti are evidently aimed at clamping down on dissent in order to undermine the development of a democratic culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police on Sunday, November 24, 1996 and Monday November 25, 1996 picked up Mwanajiti and Zulu, searched their respective offices and confiscated documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CCC has contested the matter in court questioning the powers of the police to freeze their accounts and police's refusal to abide by a court order to hand over the confiscated documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High Court judge Peter Chitengi will make a ruling on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CCC General Assembly also expressed concern at the &quot;unprofessional manner in which the state owned media are being used to peddle and promote hate propaganda&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We urge the media to recognise the vital role it plays in fostering democracy,&quot; the CCC statement advised.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since MMD rigged the elections and President Chiluba, a wicked ruler who rejoiced and celebrated the stoning of a British Airways crew by University of Zambia students, was sworn in for a fraudulent second term, a number of people could not sleep in their homes for fear of harassment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crooks who rigged the elections would want all Zambians and the country's cooperating partners to keep quiet about their wicked deeds, thereby imposing a culture of silence over the whole nation in the way they have carved themselves another term of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harassment and all sorts of lies and framings befall those who refuse to be silenced, especially those who dare to expose the crime of their leaders over the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But dishonest men will never rule for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you get more stubborn every time you are corrected, one day you will be crushed and never recover,&quot; reads Proverbs 29; 1, adding in verse 16: &quot;When evil men are in power, crime increases. But the righteous will live to see the downfall of such men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloodthirsty rulers hate anyone who is honest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While admitting the fact that all humans do err, there is need to distinguish between honest people who make wrong judgements and outright crooks who create elaborate schemes to rig elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no matter how often the wicked bring down an honest person, he or she will always get up again; but disaster destroys crooks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are aware that President Chiluba, through cash 'donations' and job offers or promises thereof, has corrupted the souls of many weak men and women to sing praises for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has PAREMO, Rainbow monitors, and Dixon Konkola to provide the chorus and the Christian Council of Zambia - through Reverend Violet Sampa-Bredt - to provide the verses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sampa-Bredt is a new convert. In fact she appears to have surprised her church colleagues by her turn-coat behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the refusal by Sampa-Bredt, Electoral Commission chairman, justice Bobby Bwalya, Lusaka Province MMD chairman and nominated member of parliament Christopher Chawinga, and others to examine the growing evidence of rigging does not surprise us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What worries us about the treachery of these people is that Sampa-Bredt, as a person of God, is abusing the trust people have placed in her as an example of moral uprightness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another worry is that it appears that it is the very people who shout loudest about their faith in God who are the least upright and who will easily delve into deceitfulness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba himself declared this nation Christian but has proceeded to hold fraudulent elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba told his party convention last December that it would be criminal for him not to have a second term of office. How can losing an election be a crime for a democrat in a democracy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, he asked the convention delegates, in front of television cameras, what would happen to the government houses and offices they occupy and the cars they drive if the elections were lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This alone speaks volumes as to why the polls had to be rigged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia yet again failed to make her beauty power felt at the pretigious heavily contested Miss World Beauty pageant held in India last week which saw the crowning of Miss Greece as world champion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite having failed to sail through to the semi-finals of the contest, Zambia's Alice Banda feels she contributed a great deal to selling Zambia's image to the outside.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We distributed a lot of tourism literature from Zambia National Tourist Board and gave out information of the country and I think this was a great contribution,&quot; Banda said in an interview on Tuesday adding: &quot;It was just an experience of a lifetime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She looked great and was composed. At least confidence was among her strong points during the introductions,&quot; said one of the viewers, a Lusaka cosmetics sales lady, Mubanga Mwansa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pageant that saw the participation of 88 contestants drawn from all over the world had staked US$65,000 prize money for the winner, 12 nights stay at any of the Sheraton Group Hotels, free travel and a three nights holiday in Seychelles including several other generous packages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about how she fared in the contest, Banda said it was difficult to tell because of the manner in which the participants were judged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its really difficult to tell how they were judging us because all the contestants only spent 30 seconds with the judges and its very difficult to tell what they based their judgement on as there was little time for them to get to know the contestants,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banda has however pledged to continue charity duties which her predecessor has left and has assured the business community that they can call on her if at all they require representation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Human Rights Association of Zambia(HRAZ) president, Dixon Konkola, yesterday declared the November 18 presidential parliamentary elections free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Konkola, who was until recently president of the United Progressive Party (UPP), said at a press briefing at Lusaka's Holiday Inn Garden Court Hotel yesterday that the elections were conducted in a free and fair atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There wasn't any intimidation or coercion from any part of the government and on that score we can say the elections were free and fair,&quot; Konkola declared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Liberal Progressive Front chairman, Rodger Chongwe, who is the national trustee of the HRAZ, disassociated himself from Konkola's declaration saying he has not been attending meetings of the association lately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe also said HRAZ never monitored the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Konkola who is also president of UPP is using my name in vain.  They should just shut up and say nothing of what they don't know otherwise they will make the HRAZ a laughing stock,&quot; Chongwe charged.&quot;It would be folly for me to give a clean bill of health to a process that is evidently fraudulent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Konkola admitted the decision to declare the elections free and fair was arrived at without the consent of other members who were not present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot stop making a decision because one person has not attended the meeting,&quot; Konkola said. &quot; Chongwe is entitled to his own opinion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HRAZ was earlier this year one of the outspoken Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) over the 1996 Constitutional (Amendment) Bill, the Public Order Act and other contentious issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But HRAZ secretary general, Aldophus Mubanga, who earlier this year conducted a one-man picket at the Parliament Building over the constitution adoption procedure, claimed &quot;most of the issues he demonstrated for had been addressed by the government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A number of issues were solved and we are still forging ahead,&quot; Mubanga said, refusing to drawn into further discussion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Heart problems threaten to cut the career of Africa's top footballer short, but he is determined to play again</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Nwankwo Kanu was voted African Footballer of the Year this week his emotions would have been unusually mixed for someone following in the footsteps of Liberian legend George Weah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the tall, slim 20-year-old Nigerian must have been thrilled to receive the ultimate accolade available to a footballer from the continent, the joy was tinged with more than a hint of sadness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bitter truth facing the man who once dreamt of becoming the best footballer in the world is that he may never play again. At an age when most South Africans have yet to experience senior football, his career may be over.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu has had a heart defect since birth, but none of the medical tests he underwent revealed the life-threatening condition until he visited the Italian Institute of Sports Medicine in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Kanu, whose younger brother plays professionally in Switzerland, it was just a routine examination, necessitated by his transfer from Dutch club Ajax to leading Italian side Inter Milan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the doctors discovered a problem that was so big and so obvious, they initially suspected faulty equipment. The tests were repeated 24 hours later.  The results were the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu, the rising star who had captained his country to Olympic glory in the United States, was facing the biggest challenge of his life. Italian heart specialists had declared him unfit to play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first the midfielder, who has already won more medals than most footballers can hope to amass in a lifetime, was stunned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I knew nothing about it. In all these years, nobody has said anything about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shock and disbelief left Nigerians speechless. Some blamed the heart condition on the mafia, reasoning that this was Italian revenge for an early elimination from the Olympic football tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others thought it was a cruel prank, saying that if there really was a problem, the medical staff at such a famous club as Ajax Amsterdam would surely have picked it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiser words came from those who noted that Nigeria had already buried two footballers, who collapsed while playing and died of cardiac arrest, and this was one &quot;hat-trick&quot; the country could do without.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a land sharply divided along political lines, the vast, football-crazy West African nation united behind their young idol with President Sani Abacha taking the lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While spiritualists and witch doctors wanted to help, a decision was reached that Kanu would have surgery in the American city of Cleveland. The Nigerian went under the knife last week and initial reports offer hope, albeit slim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors opted to repair rather than replace the heart valve to maximise his chances of fulfilling his dream and becoming a football legend ... an African Pele.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now comes the agonising wait as Kanu will not know until March whether his future involves playing the game he cherishes so dearly. If optimism counts for anything, he cannot fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not finished,&quot; Kanu insists. &quot;No one knows what the future holds, but if you want to influence your future, you have to fight for what you believe in. I just want to get back on the pitch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a typical African introduction to the game, kicking a makeshift ball on dusty, uneven streets, Kanu gave notice of his potential at 17 by joining Nigerian first division club Iwuanyanwu Nationale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He won a championship medal with the club from the eastern town of Owerri in 1993, the same year that he helped Nigeria defeat Ghana in the first all- African final of the world junior championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu was the second-highest scorer with five goals and his talents did not go unnoticed. Ajax, the Dutch club which specialises in developing raw young talent, took him to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within six months the youngster, who sometimes appeared so awkward as his long arms and legs flew in all directions, was challenging for a first-team place with one of the mightiest teams on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From then on the facts resemble fiction as Kanu helped his club win the Dutch title, the European Champions Cup, the European Super Cup and the World Club Championship. So much, so soon, for someone so young.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the best had yet to come as Kanu was selected captain of the Nigerian Olympic squad which went to the United States against a traditional background of upheaval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutch coach had temporarily abandoned his charges ... there were the inevitable pay disputes ... no training ground had been booked in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria began their quest to become the first football gold medallists from Africa with a hard-fought lone-goal victory over Hungary. It was a shot from Kanu that separated the teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not score again until the last minute of the semi-final showdown with favourites Brazil. The goal brought the gladiators level at 3-3 and Kanu struck again in the fourth minute of extra time. It was truly a &quot;golden goal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History will record that Nigeria came from behind twice in the final to defeat Argentina 3-2 and raise African football to a new status. Nigeria were on top of the world and Kanu felt like a king.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not in his worst nightmare could he have imagined the shock that awaited him. However, he must be encouraged by the support of fellow professionals with Italian Gianluca Vialli suggesting Kanu succeed Weah as European Footballer of the Year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final word goes to his mother, the proud, rural woman who saw her son develop into a national hero. &quot;With God everything is possible. In a situation like this it is best to seek divine intervention.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Perhaps the most amazing aspect of Francois Pienaar's defection to the ranks of English league rugby came in the shape of the contention by South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu)chief executive Rian Oberholzer that the axed World Cup captain still has a future in Springbok rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is surely stretching credibility to new limits, even by the standards of the game in this country. Simple logic would dictate that if Pienaar did have a future, he would never have signed his multi-million rand deal with Saracens in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal, reportedly worth well over R2- million a year during the three years Pienaar will brave the mud and rain of England, is a sign of the regard the player is held in by the rest of the rugby-playing world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, by declaring Pienaar a free agent from the end of this year, it also releases Sarfu from the contract they least wanted to carry without having to look for the likes of the &quot;golfing loophopes&quot; which have started emerging of late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is no secret that Sarfu, faced like all of us with the savage spectre of the declining rand, are anxious - and quite rightly so - to trim back the wage bill the World Cup and looming professionalism forced on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is already talk of trimming back the national squad to 26 and relying more heavily on match fees for internationals. There are also murmurs of some of the other, currently less productive, World Cup contracts being bought out.  This, too, is sensible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professionalism caught rugby by surprise in much the same manner as the Welshmen of Neath are renowned for grabbing their opponents in the southern regions of their rugby shorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look at the state of finances at Northern Transvaal, one of the biggest unions in the country and certainly one with the most ardent and enduring support. The deficit the union reported in its last set of accounts was blamed largely on the number of players contracted by the Blue Bulls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For, surely, no business on earth outside the celluloid confines of Hollywood agrees to pay in advance on the strength of performances yet to be delivered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African cricket has taken the lead in this regard ... as indeed it has in so many aspects of fitting sport and professionalism into the ill- fitting jigsaw of our national existence. Players are awarded graded, annual contracts for not unreasonable monthly salaries on their performances from the season just past. This is then filled in with negotiated - and eminently fair -match fees for the Tests and one-day internationals they play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following year's contract is again negotiated on exactly the same basis.  What is more, the contract criteria and the figures involved in these contracts are given up front, so transparency is assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rugby seems belatedly about to follow the logical path to payment that cricket has so sensibly mapped out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one two-sided thought emerges from the pressure lifted on all concerned by Pienaar's decision to mix it with the Poms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, there cannot be too many contracts like this one being offered, and secondly, in a country where the non-governmental agencies and private sector are increasingly being called on to do the jobs governments and officials of all persuasions were elected for, we cannot continue to look for outside assistance to bail us out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pienaar, one feels, deserves every last cent. He has been treated abysmally and whether new coach Andre Markgraaff wins or loses in the long run, that fact does not change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, it is surprising that the selectors - given that they did not see him as an automatic Test choice - did not give Pienaar the option of leading the Wednesday side on the current tour to help blood the new crop of Test players. They could have had his depth of knowledge and experience for nothing, or at least for the fee they had already committed to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saracens have had to pay for these self-same attributes with one of the biggest contracts in world rugby.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There are many things that are very different about the annual Nedbank Million Dollar Challenge at Sun City ... and not all of them have to do with the golf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, off the surface of the long, twisting green arena of the playing area, the majority of things have very little to do with the game which is central to the yearly bash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tournament is just another manifestation of the vision Sol Kerzner showed by carving his own version of the way Africa should look out of the unremitting bushveld. The event was conceived to get people to focus on Sun City.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without detracting from the quality of the players who have come to shoot a little white ball at one of golf's biggest roulette wheels, it was and remains a designed-for-TV spectacular, to which has been added another dimension ... hoards of middle-aged men in hats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now, however, the intention here to expand on the foibles of a gallery trapped in the core of an extinct volcano, be it as one of the buzzing horde of day-trippers or the more serious who stay for the full five rounds of pro-am and tournament play. More to the point is an examination of the inherent specialness of the Million itself; a huge prize, a limited field and no cut at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last of these three points, the ethos of the Million defies the common practice of tournament play, which dictates if you don't perform, you don't get to the pay-out window. In direct contrast, this is an event in which a dozen already rich young men are assured of at least a purse of $100 000 for bringing home the tail of the fore-shortened field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is something almost anti-golf in this, denying the oft-quoted adage of the professional tournament player that you can win the Masters one week and miss the cut the next. The trick then is in getting the balance right among the nominated 12, something that was never managed better than in the chase for the million that Colin Montgomerie eventually took home to Scotland after facing down our own Ernie Els over three extra holes of sudden-death play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was, as the sweating Montgomerie pointed out, a tough battle to the tape, and left him with the satisfaction of both taking away the major cheque and some satisfaction from snatching one back from Els.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montgomerie, though he must be given full credit for diplomacy at the end of a back- breaking second day, when the Friday consisted of making up the leeway caused by the thunderstorms of the opening round and having to bear the brunt of the one-eyed support of the home-town boy. &quot;It was,&quot; he said, &quot; quite hard to concentrate out there at times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Els, while clearly enjoying the fact that the galleries were his to rule, agreed in his normal direct and laid-back fashion. &quot;They're out there having a good time and some of them have a few too many beers,&quot; he said, softening the punch with that lazy smile which takes every ounce of sting out of whatever he says. &quot;You mean cokes, don't you? said his anxious questioner, Jimmy Metcalfe. &quot;No,&quot; said Ernie, the smile broadening, &quot;I mean beers!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in this, the two players - admittedly in very different ways - touched on what makes the Million both the resounding public success and its private failure as a tournament. There are, in short, too many in the galleries there for the beer and the buzz. The vast majority of the legions who trek to the Pilanesberghave come for the corporate hospitality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have come for the hat and the dated golf shirt. A day to do business and get totally blasted before the bus takes them back to the big city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is something which is now firmly woven into the event. An addition which ensures both its popularity and its continuance. But, just as an observation, it is a factor that if it doesn't worry the tournament organisers right now, will become their biggest headache in years to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accent, quite rightly, is on fun. This is as it should be. The organisation comes as close to being flawless as is humanly possible. But it only takes a handful to turn that into the meaner side of the South African psyche. And, it must be added, there are just too many people to effectively police the course against such a manifestation eventually breaking through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The carnival atmosphere which surrounds the very serious business out on the course is at odds with what the professionals are trying to accomplish.  And, in years to come, if the off-course behaviour continues to deteriorate under a veritable ocean of consumables, invariably wet, sometimes - but not always - cold and always alcoholic, the players themselves must surely have to take a second look at braving the mobs for a big pay-day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, even with all this, the Million is a special occasion. And invariably the finish lives up to this, whether it be the cold- blooded dismantling of the course Nick Price managed four years ago, or the excitement of having Els and Montgomerie slug it out to the finish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is equally proven - this time around - by the statistics which saw Corey Pavin, last year's instant millionaire, finish under-par and yet in the guard's van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Pavin who was denied entrance to the media centre by the gate guard, who doubtless had his own very specific orders. Pavin took it in good heart and when his pleas that he was a player and did not have a media pass were not good enough to gain him entry, waited for an official to get him through.  Where else, you must ask, would that happen?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's running was also enhanced by the charge made to join the play- off by both Price and Steve Jones, who finished a shot back from a place in the play-off and, despite the effort involved in getting that close, will be relegated to the history of also-rans on this year's final leader board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is perhaps sad that this is so, for everyone in this year's field played better than ever before. It really was a super event out there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Off the course? It is perhaps well to remember what VS Naipaul once wrote: &quot; In the end, Africa grows over everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - On Sunday December 8 the South African cricket team will take the first step to immortality. If Hansie Cronje becomes the first captain in the history of Test cricket to achieve the most difficult comeback in the game, he will symbolise everything that is South African cricket.  Never say die, wait 'til the fat lady sings, guts and character ... and all that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team battle has already been won. All that remains is a contest between the &quot;winners&quot; (South Africa) and a small group of highly talented individuals who will need to register career-high performances to stop their visitors from winning a three-Test series - for the second time - after losing the first Test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until Cronje resurrected the series against New Zealand in late 1995, the feat was thought to be cricket's equivalent of raising the dead. The only previous occasion had been in the last century when WG Grace managed the feat despite having to captain the England side in a jacket and tie.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Test cricket's frantically changing face becomes more the prince and less the frog with every series played around the world, and Cronje's team showed the Test-playing nations just what was possible. Ken Rutherford was so impressed he decided to stay in the land of his conqueror, and since then both Wasim Akram and Arjuna Ranatunga have repeated the feat - against Zimbabwe and Pakistan respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But against India, in India, the series triumph will be considerably more of an achievement than any of the other comebacks. In the days when five days of cricket used to represent more of a test of physical endurance for players than anything else, a defensive team could ensure a draw as long as they played reasonably. Over rates were manipulated beyond normal recognition (without punishment), but more importantly, fitness levels invariably dictated that &quot;pressure&quot; was only ever applied to opposing batsmen for the limited period that fast bowlers and fielders were fresh and strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa took up the mantle of fitness laid down by Australia in the early 1990s and perfected the art of body conditioning to the point where they can now maintain a consistent attack for the best part of six hours per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is exactly what India ran into at Eden Gardens in the best Test match seen in these parts for the last decade. Despite Mohammed Azharuddin's spine- tingling 74-ball century in the midst of the Indian recovery, there was never a moment when the home team could relax and contemplate a really serious recovery. The tourists were forced to baton down the hatches until Azhar blew over, but once the storm was finished, their relentless pursuit of victory continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lance Klusener, who suffered more than most while the former Indian captain was at the crease, bounced back in stunning fashion as everyone now knows.  Less well publicised was the warming humility he showed immediately after the thrashing: &quot;I would rather have been fishing at home in Natal,&quot; he joked after Azharuddin had become only the fourth batsman in Test history to hit five consecutive boundaries in an over. &quot;But it was also a privilege to be on the same field as him. It was an incredible experience to see a Test century scored off 74 balls, even though it was terrible for me personally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cronje, incidentally, went even further in his praise of the innings, but it was Klusener's ability to see the game in its full context, and look beyond the moment of his own worst despair, that set him apart from the average debutant fast bowler. And it was undoubtedly one of the reasons that he was able to take 8-64 in the second innings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, while South Africa were praising Azharuddin, Indian selectors and team members saw Azharuddin's 15th Test century as confirmation that his career is almost at an end. It was obvious to anybody who looked beyond the brilliance of the statistics that the batsman did not care about the team, his record, the match or his place. An Indian selector had told Azharuddin before the Test that his place had been discussed after an indifferent display in the first Test at Ahmedabad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His response at Eden Gardens, while good enough to merit additions to at least three pages in the Wisden Book of Records, contained more than a dash of petulance. The criticism he received for his recent marriage to film actress Sangita Bijlani may have been unwarranted and rather puritanical, but it has robbed him of much of his desire to play cricket at the highest level.  He has become a &quot;loner&quot;, too, according to one member of the Indian team. &quot;He is no longer good for our spirits ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of a genuine opener has also begun to batter morale and Nayan Mongia has been viciously criticised for failing against the pace of Donald, Klusener and McMillan. His victimisation has been unjust - nobody has fared successfully. Back-biting has once again made its home within the Indian camp and the talk of dropped catches has become a game of Chinese whispers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bowlers and batsmen are dividing into two camps and Sachin Tendulkar, burdened with a batting average of just 13 since he took over the captaincy three Tests ago, is powerless to bring the team back together. The euphoria of victory lasts shorter in India than anywhere else in the world, and Ahmedabad has become a faded, distant memory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, indeed, have won the psychological war. They will surely win the series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that can halt them is rare individualism. Tendulkar may emulate the performance of Gary Kirsten and record a brace of centuries (in one or both innings), Javagal Srinath could have a 10-wicket match if his shameful luck at Eden Gardens is reversed, and Anil Kumble, too, could be decisive on another wicket that will undoubtedly suit his style. But Test matches are rarely won by individuals. Five days is a long time in any sport, and to succeed at the end of that time, 11 men have to function as a unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kampur is barely 100 miles from the southern border of Tibet and conditions will once again be a test of the South Africans' digestive systems, senses of humour and patience, as well as batting and bowling on a dry, spinner- friendly surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afternoon temperatures will be at least half what they have become used to (between 12 and 14 degrees) while evenings will be as cool as five or six degrees. Hotels are certainly not five-star and local fans, who regard Test matches as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, will be as passionate as anywhere else in the country and will have scant thought for team privacy in their search for autographs. But all this will not matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If team spirit during the game against an Indian A team in Nagpur was anything to go by, then South Africa's has become indestructable. The unbeaten 200 from Herschelle Gibbs was final proof of an extraordinary talent and raised team morale even higher. During one drinks break on the second day, the tourists were in such jaunty high-jinks that they even lit fire-crackers on the outfield. The whole mood was summed up by Paul Adams, who celebrated his second wicket with a handstand filk-flak in the middle of the wicket! Put simply, South Africa have won more than half the battle, because, as Don Bradman said, &quot;80% of this game is played in the head&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Not even Britain's publicity-hungry Booker Prize could have come up with the scandal that rocked the French literary world last week.  Calixthe Beyala, winner of the 100000-franc Academie Francaise's Grand Prix du Roman, was accused of plagiarising Ben Okri's 1991 Booker winner, The Famished Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyala denied plagiarism: &quot;I know Ben Okri well. We lived in the same world and come from the same poor background.&quot; She claimed such borrowings were common in African literature and threatened to sue the critic who had pointed out the similarities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okri, however, retorted: &quot;I don't buy that. It's not part of the literary tradition. I want people to read me, but I don't want people to steal from my work. If there is a case, then it's a matter for the courts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyala, a Franco-Cameroonian writer who has won two other major prizes, won the prize for her eighth novel, Les Honneurs Perdus (Lost Honours). Critics had praised it as &quot;a new beginning for African literature&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyala said the accusations of theft are motivated by &quot;racial hatred.  They're trying to destroy me.&quot; In May this year, however, she was successfully sued for &quot;partially counterfeiting&quot; a novel by the American Howard Buten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyala is not the first African author to be embroiled in a plagiarism row.  Mbulelo Mzamane was accused of plagiarising Jospeh Lelyveld's Move Your Shadow and, in 1968, Yambo Ouologuem was charged with unacknowledged borrowings from Graham Greene for his novel Bound to Violence, just after this had won the French Prix Renaudot. Ouologuem defended himself convincingly, showing that the original manuscript acknowledged borrowings in quotation marks - omitted by his publisher. It can be argued that his borrowings, transformations, parodies and pastiches resulted in a post-modern novel before its time, full of clashes and contradictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oddest thing about l'affaire Beyala is that for her to take, unacknowledged, other writers' work seems astonishingly pointless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is a very fine writer indeed, with a powerful continuity of thematic interests shining through a series of novels. Heinemann has published three of the seven in English translation. Loukoum, reviewed in these pages a year ago, is a more genial, less harrowing novel than its predecessors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of these - The Sun Hath Looked Upon Me and Your Name Shall Be Tanga - were issued by Heinemann a few months ago. Short novels of great intensity, both are about the search by young African women to escape the continuum of oppression by men and by conservative women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both there is a fiercely determined urge to witness: female characters describe in often shocking detail the specifics of their lives and yet insistently (and sensitively) generalise on women's experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent essay, she wrote: &quot;I come into the world out of female crack ...  a comical black plum bawling away till I die.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - LIGHT VERSE AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL by Gus Ferguson (David Philip, R29)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a bit of selective quotation, you could even argue that Gus Ferguson is a serious poet:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life is but a gift of time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spent in gathering evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against the summons for the crime Of wasting that inheritance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, on an African fir tree:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each upturned branch will never know</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or test, its destined weight of snow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, almost maudlin Donne:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If love is blind then, welcome night!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It often depends on context, of course: this last quote, from Sonnet in Couplets, continues:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her lover's love remains emphatic -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's mercifully astigmatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those rhythms and that title bear witness to Ferguson's joyous obsession with form and craft; he revels in the paradoxical freedoms and challenges of the sonnet, the triolet, the haiku, even prose parodies of journ- and ad- speak. Not to mention his inimitably slapdash drawings. And he does it with such unerring facility as to make the rest of us free-versers feel like shambling tramps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is best, probably, in the shorter forms, such as this deliciously quirky haiku:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By an ancient pond</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a frog sits upon a log</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">waiting for Basho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are outrageous puns (&quot;Amongst cannibals/ the phrase 'battered wife' assumes/ Another meaning&quot;) and oriental paradoxes (&quot;I know for sure one thing that's true:/ The Universe is just a clue&quot;). There seems to be no quirk of language he can't turn on itself, as in lamenting the demise of an old computer: &quot;Dos to Dos/ Ascii to Ascii.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he is serious, sharply observant, critical. Beneath irrepressible playfulness is a tone of terrible lament at humanity's destructiveness.  Everything he writes is a protest against our uncaring blindness and dulled stupidity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just buy this wonderful volume! It will keep you warm, giggly and thoughtful for as long as you own it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Wylie's collection of poems, The Road Out, was published last month by Snailpress</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - &quot;Oh Shucks!&quot; you might say, &quot;there's another Schuster movie opening countrywide.&quot; Many culture vultures and intellectuals regard Leon Schuster as a schlockmeister; but his continual success at the box-office (There's A Zulu on My Stoep outperformed Die Hard with a Vengeance in Germany and his films have sold to over 40 countries worldwide) suggests he must be doing something right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schuster's mix of candid camera lampoonery and coarse storylines are consistent with the historic style of South African comedy - from Al Debbo to Jamie Uys, to whom Schuster is the natural-born successor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His latest effort, Panic Mechanic, revolves around a successful games show host Shucks (played by Schuster) who loses his job through affirmative action and ends up producing candid camera videos for Jack Paddaman's Stress Academy.  Shyster Paddaman, played with glee by Frantz Dubrowsky, plans to make a film to help the President's Children's Fund and steal the proceeds ... Of course, good old Leon comes to the rescue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's interesting about Schuster's latest films is the way they have touched on current politics. Sweet and Short was his take on the new South Africa; There's a Zulu on My Stoep used reconciliation as its theme. Panic Mechanic explores the nature of South African stress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As co-writer Gus Silber, award-winning satirist and journalist, puts it, &quot;A lot of his humour comes from pushing people too far. There's something funny in excessively stressful situations. Leon uses the intense racial and political situation and takes it to the limits.&quot; As for the derision for some of Schuster's work, Silber says: &quot;A lot of intellectuals have a kind of allergic reaction to his films. I think it'd be a good idea if they were locked in a room and you threw away the key, and they were forced to watch his movies. They'd have to laugh, even if only at how seriously we take life in South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director David Lister agrees. &quot;This is definitely his funniest picture to date, partly because it has its finger firmly on the pulse of what's happening in the country in terms of things like affirmative action, crime and violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schuster has undoubtedly progressed from his early days as a simple prankster. He started out with a radio show called Waar en Wolhaar, where he took the piss out of the public with hoax phone calls. His work has matured a little, although Lister firmly believes his finest work is yet to come. &quot;Look, I like movies like Burnt by the Sun and I admire Bergman and so on, but I believe in entertainment and Leon is a master at that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the reason for his enormous popularity is that he appeals to such a broad cross-section of people. Silber says: &quot;Schuster has been reaching for a different style, a crossover audience if you like. His style is rooted in a firm South African tradition but it's also like watching a silent movie, because so much of the humour is physical. So there are no cultural or language barriers. It's like equal opportunity comedy that strikes a uniquely South African chord .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movie was shot on Super 16 to ensure a high shooting ratio because of all the candid camera stuff, where there were often three or four cameras operating at once. It was then blown up to 35mm for release. Schuster, a perfectionist and an energetic taskmaster, had sinus problems during the shoot and was hospitalised for a week but the picture still came in on time and within its budget of R4.5-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To cover costs, including prints, advertising and distribution, Panic Mechanic will have to generate at least R10-million, but with an unprecedented release of 83 prints for a local film and the funnyman's proven popularity, it shouldn't be a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schuster was not available for comment. His wife said on the phone earlier this week: &quot;It's been a hell of a tough year for him so he's taking a break.  He's gone deep-sea fishing on the East Coast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workaholic funnyman will probably dream up another movie while he kills innocent fish and addles his active brain in the hot African sun.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - At the very least, Hitch-hiker will probably go down in the annals of contemporary art as one of the most aggressive - and effective - inter-media marketing blitzes ever undertaken by the local artworld. It is the first exhibition in South Africa to actively engage with varied mass communciation technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has shoved the tools of the information trade into the gallery space and simultaneously transgressed the physical borders of its normally insular galaxy by infiltrating mass-cultue constellations such as radio, print and even the post office. While its multi-media friendliness cannot be faulted, some of its messages remain facile.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambitious brainchild of curator Clive Kellner, Hitch-hiker was conceived &quot;as a vehicle to explore the role of technology and information in an age of multi- culturalism&quot;. Twenty artists, 16 based in South Africa and Eugenio Dittborn from Chile, Jimmie Durham from Belgium, Grant Lee Neuenberg from Mozambique and Olu Oguibe from Nigeria, have invaded the mindscapes of various media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the wittiest works on show is an ad for an auction of The Rainbow, placed in the Mail &amp; Guardian by Stephen Hobbs, that takes an irreverent swipe at the commodification of post- apartheid South Africa. At the auction on opening night, bidders received a certificate entitling them to a colour of the rainbow - and by implication - its illusory pot of gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minette Vari produced a take-away poster advertising the exhibition.  Consisting of a male-female composite of the artist, it attempts to confront issues of identity and the role of the mass media in reconstructing and perpetuating that identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exploiting the principle of auditory arousal, Joachim Schonfeldt embarked on a collaborative project with 702 Talk Radio, consisting of familiar everyday sounds packaged in 10-second slots and played over the air. A barrage of art-by-airmail that must have set the postal services back months was sent individually by Willem Boshof, Eugenio Dittborn and Kim Lieberman.  And Kendell Geers infiltrated cyberspace with a computer-based work, accessed through the Internet, that displays every racial and sexual expletive ever hurled, to reflect the prejudice in us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a truism to say that art no longer speaks in absolute terms nor lays claim to represent reality - particularly when the boundaries between the real and hyper- version have broken down irretrievably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology rules the roost in the areas of information and ideas. And with its tarnished aura and diminshed autonomy, art seems to be able to do little more than represent itself, comment on the rest of the world and perhaps interact with it beyond the confines of its own treadmill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this respect Hitch-hiker serves as an appropriate metaphor for a cultural community caught in an indeterminate space, rooted in little other than a strange sense of purpose and functioning like a group of nomads in search of the next rest stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hitch-hiker's confrontation of that betwixt- and-betweenness is to be applauded, particularly through works by Schonfeldt, Siemon Allen and Robyn Orlin, who take art out of its sight-specificness and into the realm of sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it has become too trendy and too easy by far to jump on to the techno- bandwagon and simply appropriate the medium to validate and replay messages that are little more than tired truisms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, we are hapless consumers of information; old boundaries break down and new ones are built; the media have murdered our minds and we are now desensitised clones in search of an identity ... Tell us something we don't know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dematerialisation of the art object does not imply the whittling of away ideas as well. Sadly, when that happens, art becomes about as conceptually challenging as a book illustration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hitch-hiker is on at the Generator Art Space in Johannesburg through to 1997</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Whether it's the tender image of Katrina Thomas gathering her goats or the anxious look in Freddie Bosman's eyes on the bus journey towards his beloved home, Riemvasmaak, after spending 20 years in the Ciskei, some pictures do speak a thousand words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winner of a Mother Jones International Documentary Award (1993) for his highly acclaimed images of the fisherfolk of Kosi Bay, one of South Africa's leading socio- documentary photographers, Durban's Paul Weinberg, has just published some of his most poignant photographs to date in his fourth book, Back to the Land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weinberg played a pivotal role in placing South African photography on the world map in the 1980s with the establishment of Afrapix and Southlight photo agencies.His images forming a study of the Bushmen of Southern Africa, Footprints in the Sand, currently grace The Northern Territories Museum Art Gallery in Australia, before the exhibition moves on to Holland and Norway.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though fresh from a travel assignment in Sri Lanka, Weinberg's passion lies in documenting the indigenous peoples of Southern Africa, together with related land issues. He has witnessed the brutal forced removal of South Africans from the land of their ancestors, an emotional contrast from witnessing, and again documenting, the celebrations and joy of those same people returning to their land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What was most interesting for me was tracking and documenting the Bakwana ba Mogopa people on the West Coast, following the whole cycle from their resistance to removal in the spring of 1983, to their first harvest in the winter of 1995.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From the Kalahari to Kosi Bay, Weinberg has documented the untold histories of our time - &quot;yet the ones that everybody talks about&quot; - the first people returning to their land in rural South Africa, land lost under apartheid and even further back, to the days of Jan van Riebeeck and, in Achmat Dangor's words, &quot;his motley vanguard&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today Weinberg feels that one of the many ironies of South Africa is that people who live on formerly dispossessed land are not in the frontline of the struggle. &quot;They are not overtly political and therefore do not hit the news, yet they have been through as much hell as everyone else has. This book is the untold story that only now is beginning to be told.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funded by the British Overseas Development Administration and co-ordinated by the Land and Agriculture Policy Centre, this valuable project took 18 months to develop, and Back to the Land is the extremely fine and gripping end product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Weinberg, the most moving photograph in the book is of two women friends in joyful embrace. &quot;They had been separated for 21 years and I saw them meet. It was so tender and touching ... the pain and the joy of returning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Achmat Dangor echoes Weinberg's sentiments in the book's introduction: &quot; People returning to the land have begun to build homes, plough and plant, graze their animals. Look at the emptiness filling up - slowly but inexorably.  It is a beginning that cannot afford to fail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back to the Land is available in bookstores. It can also be ordered from the publishers, Porcupine Press (011) 402-4308, at R89,95</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Their products are legendary, the stuff of teenage dreams and, sometimes, adult enjoyment, yet few people outside the music industry would know the names of producers Thapelo Khomo and Don Laka. Youngsters, however, would have no trouble identifying Joe Nina and Arthur, producers in their 20s who are also artists in their own right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are just four of the hot independent or semi-independent producers around at the moment. Sizwe Zakho, producer of Rebecca, probably the country's biggest selling star last year, is another. And, of course, there's Chicco, a producer who created his own sound in the late 1980s as well as being a huge star in his own right. He's busy with his own label, Cultural African Records now, and recording new acts like New Age Kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khomo and Laka have been partly responsible for huge hits from Bayete and Boom Shaka, to name but two. Nina produced Brenda's multi- platinum Abantu Bayakhuluma and has had hits under his own name, like Ding Dong and Joy, and Arthur, well, Arthur made his name with Kaffir (as in &quot;don't call me kaffir&quot;), and is still raking it in with Die Poppe Sal Dans, with over 50 000 sales.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's the only representative of the younger dance-floor generation to have reached double platinum sales last year, with Kaffir. (The other two were Rebecca and, um, Leon Schuster.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arthur's a producer in the time-honoured South African sense - a man who goes out there to find the talent and form the acts, as well as record, promote and sell them. Indeed, the dual function of talent scout and producer has been there for a long time. But they always worked for a particular company. Nowadays, there's a trend towards independence, as in so many areas of the workplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nina and Arthur are typical of the go- getting younger generation of producers - people who know that all it takes to make music is a synthesister and the skill to use it. This has revolutionised pop music throughout the world, making for kitchen/home studio recordings everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, for some the fact that &quot;anyone&quot; can now make a recording is the core problem with pop music, because real musical gifts and skill are somewhat rarer than that. But for others, it's precisely what makes music democratic and fun. Either way, it certainly keeps the dance floors busy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are hundreds of private studios in South Africa, besides the big record company and state broadcaster studios, says Dave Alexander of Tequila Records. &quot;Most of them do jingles and voice-overs but every musician wants to produce as well eventually and most aim to get their own studio together.&quot; If an artist/producer doesn't have his own studio, but he does have a commission, he'll hire one. &quot;They're likely to go back to places where the hits are produced and where there're happy faces and a good vibe. Ian Osrin's Digital Cupboard is a good example. Thapelo Khomo works there,&quot; says Alexander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Arthur, kwaito music's the thing. It's &quot;house&quot; music with iseqamtho lyrics, current street slang. Called the &quot;king of kwaito&quot; in townships, he says he doesn't know who invented it; &quot;but I made it popular&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's not totally independent, because his contract with EMI limits him to either producing for them or for his own label, Triple 9 Music - but excludes working for other record companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has his own two studios, two production companies, a record company and seven acts at the age of &quot;twentysomething&quot;. &quot;My goal was always to be as successful as I can get so I can help people with little or no opportunity to get on in this business. These groups wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me. I put them together, out of people I knew, who came to the studio and who I found out there... I set out to be a producer, it was my dream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Nina, 23, learnt to play keyboards and drums from his father, Solomon Xaba, a multi-instrumentalist in jazz. His first album, by LA Beat, Boss Of The Road, went platinum. (Gold equals 25 000 sales, platinum equals 50 000.) &quot; LA Beat was just a concept, it was really all me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993 he joined Om Alec Khaoli's studios and did his first album under his own name, One Time One Vibe. That's where Brenda Fassie first heard him and asked him to produce for her. He was 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he did two of his biggest albums, Ding Dong and Joy, the latter at Derek Lategan's Cube Studios. He's also done the soundtrack to a British movie, Jump The Gun, directed by Les Blair, to be released here in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he works in Braamfontein in partnership with Ray Phiri in Groove House Studios, which cost &quot;close to a million&quot;. Always a freelancer, he's never been a record company employee. They employ an engineer, are training two more and will soon need a receptionist, &quot;so you see, we're part of the RDP&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laka has produced Boom Shaka, Sharon Dee, Mango Groove, Ymage, Umoja.  Turning 38 this month, he has moved from a Yeoville flat to a plot outside Johannesburg with his own studio. It'd be hard to find a more enthusiastic, motivated music man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wanted to be a conductor when I was small, but since I couldn't fulfil that dream, production is the next best thing. I studied in the 1970s, taking myself through the Royal College of London correspondence music courses, and I obtained my licentiate in classical piano and theory of music in 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recorded his first gold disc with Sakhile in 1980, when they were playing at Le Chain in Hillbrow, one of the best clubs Jo'burg has seen. Both Sakhile and Malopoets came to prominence in that venue, a tiny hole in the wall in a Hillbrow alley that was also a hole in the wall of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then I joined Umoja with Alec Khaoli and my first composition, Oneness, went gold. I left to form Ymage with Chicco and we had a double platinum with an album called Chicco, which gave him his name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there was a long gap. &quot;I'm fortunate actually. I've come around a second time ... I left the country in 1990 and played in England and Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I came back, I wanted a record deal and no-one would sign me, so I decided to do it on my own. The whole idea was to do teenage music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He linked up with Oscar, now notorious for sexually explicit lyrics, as an act in his own right and formed a record company called Kalawa. &quot;We recorded and produced groups like Brothers Of Peace, Boom Shaka, Thebe and Trompies, which went gold last year with Sigiya Ngengoma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boom Shaka did platinum on their eponymous first album. Their follow-up, Thobela, went platinum in three weeks, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laka has just produced an album of his own work, Destiny, between black and white radio programming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thapelo Khomo won the best producer and best album FNB/Sama awards for 1994 and 1995, as well as song of the year twice for Mmalo-we and Umkhaya-Lo, for his work with Bayete. He's also produced and co-produced acts like Kamazu, ImiLonji XaNtu, Lucky Dube and Tu Nokwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in 1964 into a musical family who used to sing hymns late at night before going to bed, he started playing keyboards around 1973. &quot;I joined a band at 11, a backyard band called The Mad Dogs.&quot; At the end of 1984, he went to Europe and joined Malopoets in France and toured with them to the US and England, before coming back home and joining Stimela at the end of 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Around 1989 I started becoming more independent. But between 1991 and 1993 things were bad: the whole industry was going down financially and I couldn't get work. I did piece jobs until 1993 when life started again, when Siyaya, with Stimela, did well. We sold over 40 000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, his connection to Bayete started up, with him as producer and song- writer. &quot;I was working as an independent freelancer for Teal. They knew I was hot and believed I had the music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that, after all, is what it's all about.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Visionary film-maker Haile Gerima is a handsome, rotund man with a silver, close- shaved beard, a baseball cap hiding hair- loss and features held in place by some pretty hip spectacles. The Ethiopian-born and Washington-based film-maker's work is in the poetic African genre, alongside luminaries like Djibril Diop Mambety; yet unlike many of his continental peers he doesn't rely on French finance to produce his romantic visions from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result all of his films - being the meditative vehicles they are - have been plagued by financing problems and have taken many years to complete.  Gerima compulsively sips rooibos tea (a popular beverage in Ethiopia) and gives his take on the French influence: &quot;France has been shrewd. The French have subsumed the early works of Sembene (African cinema's founding father) and Med Hondo in order to make Africa 'exotic'.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerima is in the country as a guest of the Newtown Film and Television School, a major force in developing previously undernourished local talent which, to its credit, has invited several independent creative talents as guest lecturers. These have included Mambety, Mira Nair, Gaston Kabore and Costa Gavras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a rhythmic mix of Ethiopian and American accents, Gerima considers the fate of emerging South African film-makers: &quot;There's obviously a great amount of talent in this country. I just hope the young South African film-makers don't get caught up in Hollywood. They need to find their own melody and fight for it too. You don't need to make exploitative or racist-based films, instead produce a sensitive cinema.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by the publication Index on Censorship about the future of African cinema, Gerima responded, &quot;South Africa is crucial to the rest of Africa because it has the technology and the infrastructure. But this could be a two- edged sword: it will be a platform for the USA and the rest of the West. If South Africans merely exploit this by pumping out Hollywood movies and videotapes all the way from the Cape to North Africa that could be very frightening. But if South Africans develop their own cinema and create an easy platform for film-makers all over Africa, this will be to the advantage of all of us. South Africa is a cross-roads for African cinema.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hasn't seen any local movies but given the kind of cinema he produces Gerima would probably detest our glossy Hollywood- influenced output (Cry the Beloved Country, Oh, Shucks, it's Schuster!).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerima has spent a significant period of his life in America, graduating from Los Angeles's UCLA film school and going on to a film professorship at Howard University in Washington. As a result, his films are distinctly poetic investigations into the creation of an African identity while cast into the diaspora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite his academic duties he has managed to make several innovative films:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His 1976 production Bush Mama, tells the story of a defiant and independent woman who lives on welfare in the ghetto of Watts, Los Angeles and resists welfare's interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvest: 3 000 Years is the true-life story of a peasant family's struggle to survive under virtual feudal conditions on the farm of a wealthy landowner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashes and Embers is the tale of a Vietnam vet who returns to America, only to discover the similarities between African-Americans and his country's avowed foe - the Vietnamese people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All his films share a clear line of politicised debate coupled with personalised, poetic narratives and imagery. His latest work, Sankofa (an Akan word meaning to return to the past in order to go forward) is the tale of a contemporary supermodel who is possessed by the spirits lingering in a coastal castle in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She travels back in time and becomes a house servant on a sugar plantation.  If this was a typical Hollywood picture she would probably have to right a wrong or inspire social change before returning to the present (as in the TV series Quantum Leap). However, this is a fiercely independent production and she has no mission other than survival, understanding the system of slavery and her nation's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerima struggled for nine long years to raise the million dollars needed to shoot Sankofa, a modest amount as it's a historical epic. Yet he got no joy from Hollywood, failed to garner support from America's most prolific funder of &quot;difficult&quot; movies, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), nor was the National Endowment of the Arts interested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he remarked in Index on Censorship, &quot;Many African-Americans and Chicanos can't make the movies they want to because they don't live up to the expectations of white producers. That's why you see so many black independent film-makers playing with Hollywood and making bizarre shoot 'em up and kill movies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually Sankofa was jointly financed by British and German television groups and interests from Ghana and Burkina Faso - the first time two African countries have collaborated on a film about slavery. But once the film was completed Gerima struggled to find distributors. &quot;No one wanted to touch it, the so-called independents said it was too black,&quot; he reflects. In desperation he rented a cinema in Washington with his own money and the film played for 11 weeks and subsequently travelled the country to an enthusiastic response from mainly African- American audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sankofa went on to become a huge independent hit - winning awards in Italy, Berlin and California - making enough money in America to enable Gerima to produce two documentaries; Adua 1896 (about the Italian campaign in Ethiopia) and Anchor Bye 'n Bye (about the continual historical attachment Africans in the diaspora have for the continent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its overwhelming success in America Sankofa's only African screening was in Ghana. &quot;We haven't touched the African reality,&quot; Gerima sadly adds. &quot;It's nothing new. I've been trying to get my movies shown in Ethiopia for years with no result. The bureaucracy of distribution there is impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a sad thing to be born in a Third World country with so much to say and so few resources.&quot; That strikes a particularly resonant chord among the students at Newtown's Film and Television School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerima's films can be ordered directly from his own company Mypheduh Films, PO Box 10035 Washington DC 20018-0035</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A tune that simply won't lie down and go away - that's Tom Hark. Regarded as the source of the term kwela, the controversy over its authorship is also typical of the mess left behind by the record industry in the Fifties and Sixties. Once you start to scratch the surface of this era, layers upon layers of conflict, claims and counter- claims are revealed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously on these pages we reported that this song has been attributed to two local musicians and a producer. Now, however, Joe Mogotsi of the Manhattan Brothers is saying the melody was taken from one of his group's songs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Hark first resurfaced in an article in the Mail &amp; Guardian in September this year, in an interview with Tebego Lerole, son of Elias Lerole and nephew of Aaron Lerole - both major pennywhistlers of the Fifties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wrote that Tom Hark was composed by Aaron Lerole, quoting two South African music books available: David Coplan's In Township Tonight and Muff Andersson's Music in the Mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That threw the cat among the pigeons, with Tebego's father Elias saying he wrote it. Aaron agreed. An article to this effect was printed in the M&amp;G. But it was also pointed out that it was, in fact, registered at the South African Music Rights Organisation (Samro), to the record's producer at the time, EMI's Rupert Bopape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, however, Joe Mogotsi of the Manhattan Brothers, living in England, has written to the M&amp;G saying his group actually wrote it. &quot;The real origin of this melody is a Manhattan Brothers composition called Komponeng, which was assigned to Gallo Africa and recorded by the Brothers in 1954. Gallo holds evidence of this in their archives,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Neither of the people claiming this song have any rights to it. This is another example of how the Manhattan Brothers have been deprived of their rights under the apartheid regime, when we had no access to our publishers Gallo Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called the song Tom Hawk, but an industry source confirmed that we are all talking about the same song. &quot;The name was supposed to be Tomahawk, because the Lerole brothers were fans of Westerns at the time. But somehow in the production process, it got changed to Tom Hark, so Tom Hawk is another variant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telephoned this week, Elias simply said: &quot;Tom Hark is mine. I composed it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the industry source said: &quot;The melody of Tom Hark, recorded by EMI, was taken from the middle eight bars of Komponeng. It's a mystery why Gallo didn't do anything about it at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The song is also regarded as the source of the term kwela for pennywhistle jive music. As it starts, the listener hears a group of men gambling on a street corner. Seeing a police van approaching they yell &quot;here comes the kwela-kwela&quot;, the slang name for the trucks. White teenagers apparently picked up the tag and applied it to the music.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambian government has received a pat on the back from the United Nations office in Lusaka over its committment to the eradication of poverty within Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations Development Programme Resident Representative, who is head of all UN line offices in Zambia, Gary Davis, says his office is most happy with the manner in which the Zambian government has gone about putting in place poverty eradication programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Davis promised that his office will, as a result of its approval of positive government poverty elimination schemes, go out of its way and help the President Chiluba administration improve upon current poverty removal programmes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He observed that the UNDP intends to dedicate the coming five years to poverty elimination and in Zambia this represents a major programme since 70 percent of the people live in dire and abject poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of this widespread poverty life expectancy and access to social services are incredibly low and cry out for improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia, he analysed, has great potential for positive development in that it has many viable mineral deposits and vast tracts of arable land which if used well can free the entire country from poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Davis was speaking at a prize giving ceremony to mark the end of the 1996 Poverty eradication campaign which started on October 17 and which included the writing of essays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these competitions Journalists dominated the two national competitions on poverty and related activities which were sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as part of the events to mark 'International Year for the Eradication of Poverty 1996'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Davis, noted that the deserving writers had in effect taken part in the National Essay Writing Competition on the theme 'Poverty: Causes and Solutions' which was divided into two catergories with the first catergory being for students from universities, colleges and other institutions of higher learning in the country while the second catergory was for pupils from secondary schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there was the National Media Competition which was open to all Zambian based journalists, both local and foreign, for the best coverage of poverty issues and this was won by Bwalya Nondo of the Zambia Information Services who is running the Kafue Bureau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In second place was Joe Chilaizya while Ntachi Sikaona of the Zambia Daily Mail scooped the third prize. Kellys Kaunda of Voice of America came out fourth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the National Essay Writing Competition , universities-colleges category, first prize was scooped by Cephas Moonga while the second prize went to his colleague Wilcliff Sakala. Both are students of journalism in the Department of Mass Communication of the University of Zambia in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the secondary schools category the First Prize was won by 15 year old Stacey B Mtika who is a Grade 10 pupil from Fatima Girls Secondary School in Ndola. He was followed by 16 year old Juliet Tumeo of Libala Secondary School in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate not only the winners, but all participants for the interest they have taken in exploring the issues of poverty and its solutions in Zambia today. I also wish very much to thank the various sponsors whose generosity has made this competition possible,&quot; Mr Davis declared.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambian parliament started its five-year journey today, Friday, with the re-election of National Assembly Speaker Robinson Nabulyato and his deputy, Simon Mwila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after their election the two were presented to President Frederick Chiluba who administered the oath of office and allegiance to the people of Zambia at a brief ceremony held at State House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In remarks going as part of the ceremony President Chiluba promised to uphold his Republican office by ensuring that all Members of Parliament, irrespective of political party, will enjoy their rights and priviledges in full as it is enshrined in the republican constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba further promised to open doors to State House at all times so that all Members of Parliament, again irrespective of sponsoring political party, can have access to him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He promised to help all of them with the correct interpretation of their duties so that their deliberations could be effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Mr Nabulyato had reminded the president that as father of the nation he was expected to embrace all MPs irrespective of political affiliation so they could fully enjoy their constitutional and official rights and priviledges in full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the ceremony was also Chief Justice Mathew Ngulube,the Vice-President, Godfrey Miyanda and all Members of Parliament including Cabinet Ministers and their deputies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these developments are a follow up to the heavily contested elections of November 18 which saw the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy return to office with a resounding majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clerk of the National Assembly, Mwelwa Chibesakunda, gave out notification of the date last week and since Monday the new Members of Parliament have been milling around parliament motel for their registration, identity cards and other vital procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new national assembly, which is the second under resurrected multi- party rule, has by far the biggest number of political parties represented since Zambia gained political independence from colonial master, United Kingdom of Queen Elizabeth the second on 24 October 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other than the ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy, which has 129 seats in the new assembly, the National Party too is represented with five seats and the Zambia Democratic Congress and newly formed Agenda for Zambia each of which has two seats in the assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are also the independents, the ambitious politicians who defied their parties and stood for votes on their own 'recognisance' and who represent political inclinations ranging from MMD down to United National Independence Party, who in their wisdom had decided to boycott the November 18 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the combined total of these interest groups, which are against the MMD, is still less potent than it was in 1991 when there was only UNIP in opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That time UNIP had 27 seats in parliament when parliament met for first business on 19 November 1991 against 123 seats for the MMD. Two years later oppositon seats rose to 32 after National Party picked five seats from the by- elections which followed its formation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by October this year when elections were being announced there were only about 30 seats in opposition hands after the see-saw competition for seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political pundits in Lusaka are convinced that the total number of seats in political hands and those of the independents would have been higher had opposition UNIP not listened to the out-dated strategies of its leader, Dr Kenneth Kaunda, that they boycott elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With UNIP fielding candidates at least for the position of Member of Parliament it is assumed that many of the seats which the party had clung to over the past five years would have been returned to its grip while others which went the way of the ruling party could have gone to its collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the pressing business to be resolved tomorrow is the administration of the oath of office on all MPs. Then this will be followed by the election of the Speaker of the National Assembly who is the de facto president of the institution and his deputy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter the MPs will be divided into their respective committees - each of which will take care of affairs of state. The new MPs will also be given some lessons on how they are expected to conduct themselves whilst in boundaries of parliament and at their living quarters - Parliament Motel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that they may break up for Christmas and the New Year holidays before reconvening for serious business in the New Year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the National Assembly meets tomorrow it will be doing so with a down cast face following the death of Itezhi-tezhi Member of Parliament, Dr Lumizu Shimaponda, who died in a South African hospital after an illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assembly will also be wondering which way the altercation over whether Zambia Democratic Congress should surrender its hard won seats in Western Province or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incumbent Members of parliament for ZDC, party vice-president Dr Kasuka Mutukwa and Mr Walusiku Situmbeko of Nalolo and Nalikwanda seats respectively are adamant that they cannot surrender the seats on moral grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, they argue, they were voted in all fairness and to deprive the people of these two areas out of childish party stands will be detrimental to the very foundations of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is therefore totally unacceptable and extremely dictatorial for any party member or a clique in the leadership of our democratic party to force eleceted MPs to abandon the people of Nalolo and Nalikwanda now or in future,&quot; Dr Mwauluka declared recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC deputy secretary, Azwell Banda, had astounded the nation with his childish declaration that the two MPs should abandon the two seats won in elections because those November 18 elections were allegedly rigged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kitwe - COPPERBELT provincial councils were Friday holding a one-day workshop in Kitwe at which they were reviewing the Local Government Support Project which is sponsored by the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project has been in existence now for two years and it is aimed at improving the delivery capacity of government services at local level in Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officiating at the workshop, being held at Mindolo Ecumenical Foundation, provincial local government officer, Francis Ndhlovu, said in realising the goals of the project a number of strides have been taken by the local councils to further enhance service delivery to the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The councils have in the past two years addressed themselves to two major components namely management and finance and consultancy work which has already been completed in two fields aimed at transforming the councils' capacity to deliver quality services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The councils have finished working on the public service reform programme, situation analysis, job descritiption and strategic planning components for the local government management programmes which are also aimed at streamlinging operations of the councils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ndhlovu urged the eight council representatives to be objective in their evaluations of the programme because it was from this that the impact of the programme can be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop is also expected to come up with a vision of what the local government system in Zambia should look like with or without support from the British Government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Our donor aid towards balance of payment will largely depend on how the government resolve the current political crisis,&quot; Miyashita said. &quot;As at now I don't think it is urgent for us to dispatch any money to this government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miyashita said although its was not the intention of the Japanese government to intervene in internal matters, the current political misunderstanding between the government and the opposition parties has raised a lot of concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to reduce poverty and illiteracy in Africa but as regard to Zambia we have to wait until the government renews its commitment to democratisation process,&quot; Miyashita said. &quot;It is our hope that a peaceful solution to the current confusion will be found soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miyashita said the Japanese embassy in Lusaka found it impossible to determine whether the November elections were free or not free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that although the Japanese government had donated two motor vehicles to Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) and Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT), it should not be associated with these organisations and their conclusions about the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't judge clearly if the elections were free and fair or not because of the absence of several other international monitoring groups,&quot; Miyashita said. &quot;We did not monitor elections our selves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba's press and public relations assistant, Richard Sakala, said State House would only react to the Japanese position if they had the statement from the embassy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome - TANZANIA: A joint statement was released by the Government of Tanzania and UNHCR on 5 December confirming that all Rwandan refugees in Tanzania are expected to return home by 31 December 1996. The message, addressed to all Rwandan refugees in the country, states that the United Republic of Tanzania has decided that all Rwandan refugees can now return to their country in safety. The Tanzanian Ministry of Home Affairs will coordinate the repatriation operations, assisted by the Tanzanian police force and, where necessary, the army. The Government of Tanzania has given its assurance that the repatriation process will be carried out in an orderly and humane manner. Tanzania hosts some 530,000 Rwandan refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In preparation for the repatriation operation, humanitarian agencies in Ngara and Karagwe have since formed Task Forces to discuss how best to deal with the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RWANDA: An approximate total of 6,176 tons have been distributed to date, which represents a total of 1,600,000 weekly rations or 380,000 monthly rations. Most communes are already in a position to provide monthly rations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 2,212 tons are prepositioned for the returnee programme (equivalent to 571,071 weekly rations). Overall stock position in the country stands at 7,805 tons (equivalent to 1,570,000 weekly rations).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP is taking the necessary measures in preparation for the arrival of returnees from Tanzania. Prefectures which are expected to receive most returnees are Kibungo, Byumba and Butare. Food is being prepositioned at commune level with the assistance of NGOs. WFP staffing situation is being strengthened and the logistical capacity augmented in these prefectures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stocks of biscuits are also in place in areas expected to receive further returnees. Stock levels presently stand at 364 tons with 54 tons due to arrive shortly. The total is equivalent to 1,671,264 daily rations. Way- stations have been identified for distribution alongside the roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WFP short-haul trucking fleet, operating in Rwanda, has reached 39 trucks (7 x 7 tons capacity and 32 x 15 tons capacity). An additional 16 trucks (15 tons capacity) are expected to arrive in the coming days. WFP is currently looking into possibilities of increasing its short-haul fleet further due to the expected arrival of returnees from Tanzania. These trucks are used country-wide to assist in the food distributions at the commune level.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - As the United Nations (UN) Security Council meets to discuss the final stages of the Angolan peace process, Amnesty International reiterated its call on the UN to ensure that human rights are at the forefront of its agenda on Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) which is overseeing the peace agreement of 1994 is planning to withdraw its 6,500 troops by February 1997. Although it is probable that some form of UN presence will remain beyond that date, so far a suitable and effective mechanism to protect human rights after the withdrawal has not been established.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Human rights abuses by both sides over the years have led to a profound mistrust,&quot; Amnesty International said. &quot;Without adequate human rights protection, there could be a new wave of deliberate and arbitrary killings of civilians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In late 1992 the first attempt to bring peace to Angola shattered, resulting in the killing of many hundreds of people. The lack of human rights safeguards at that time contributed to these deaths, and it cannot be stressed enough that at this very delicate stage of Angola's transition to peace, everybody concerned must have human rights as their main priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was largely an atmosphere of mistrust which caused the delays in completing the main tasks specified in the 1994 peace agreement. At the end of November 1996, the incorporation of UNITA troops into the Angolan Armed Forces had hardly started and the proposed Government of National Unity and Reconciliation was not in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is calling on the UN to assist in the establishment of a human rights mechanism to provide human rights protection after its troops withdraw. There are various models which could provide the basis for such a mechanism -- the UN has instituted monitoring operations in Burundi, Cambodia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any mechanism set up in Angola could be assisted initially by international human rights monitors and other experts. Eventually these outside experts could be replaced by Angolans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If an impartial, independent and effective human rights mechanism were set up it would send a clear message to all in Angola that human rights violations will not be tolerated,&quot; Amnesty International said. &quot;This would help to instill confidence and allow the mistrust to fade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UN should ensure that the Angolan peace process is not considered complete until adequate protection for human rights, without which peace cannot last, is established.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Canadian Defence Minister Doug Young yesterday mooted the idea of scrapping military intervention by the multi-national force (MNF), saying the mass return of refugees to Rwanda all but eliminated the need for such a force. He also thought it unlikely that relief airdrops would be required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an absolutely phenomenal success without military intervention,&quot; he told reporters after a cabinet meeting in Ottawa. &quot;It doesn't look as though they (airdrops) are going to be required in any significant way because NGOs are in that area on the border between Zaire and Rwanda.&quot; He added that ways of providing humanitarian aid would have to be looked at, &quot; but I don't think at this stage it will require any major military intervention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kampala, a Canadian military spokesman said politicians would meet at the weekend, probably in Ottawa, to set a date for the MNF to move aid.  Relief agencies have expressed frustration over the lack of information provided by the MNF. A UNHCR spokesman in Goma, quoted by AFP, said they were expecting to meet MNF liaison officers &quot;from one day to the next&quot; to discuss coordination, but that &quot;they do not appear to be in a hurry.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aerial surveillance by the multi-national forces have found no more than 165,000 refugees on the move or displaced people in a 150km-wide swathe of North and South Kivu, Lt Gen Maurice Baril, commander of the MNF, told a meeting of humanitarian agencies in Nairobi today. Flights by British and US spotter planes - some of which had been fired upon or &quot;painted&quot; by anti- aircraft radar - are taking high-resolution photographs by day and thermal images by night, and had discovered only one major concentration of about 150, 000 people west of Lake Kivu. Lt-Gen Baril said that the remainder are scattered in smaller groups. Locations previously reported as having large groups of refugees or displaced people (for example Mwenga and Fizi), were surveyed and no concentrations were sighted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baril said &quot;we don't claim that we got them all&quot;, admitting that a group of about 30,000, thought to ex-FAR, Interahamwe and their families, had &quot; disappeared&quot; somewhere around Masisi. In his briefing for a group of NGOs and UN agencies at the DHA office in Nairobi, Baril said his mission was strictly humanitarian and that he had &quot;neither the tools, nor the means, nor the intention&quot; to affect the political or military situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Numbi&quot; group of 150,000, in the mountains and river valleys west of lake Kivu, were the primary target for humanitarian assistance, he said, but he added that the military situation around Walikale would need to be resolved in order to get safe access to them. He also announced that Italian and French forces would join the MNF in Uganda by the weekend, and that airdrops would be considered only after a number of criteria, relating to safety, management and distribution on the ground were met. He said he would &quot; cooperate&quot; with the rebel authorities, but not &quot;negotiate&quot;. Baril reminded the meeting that he was operating under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which allows the MNF to act despite protests from member states involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the whole of November, US estimates (the highest available) indicate 656,500 refugees returned to Rwanda. Against a UNHCR registered caseload of 1.  096 million Rwandan refugees (not including 143,000 Burundian refugees) in Zaire before the crisis, basic arithmetic suggests there should be a minimum of 439,500 remaining in Zaire. The &quot;missing Rwandan refugees&quot; therefore number 274,500. Given that about 60,000 Burundian refugees have returned to Burundi, their remainder in Zaire should be about 83,000. Therefore the total missing refugees may be 357,500. These calculations do not take possible Zairean displaced populations into account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of explanations have been advanced for this phenomenon: the possibility that the refugees were never there in the first place - double counting and inaccurate registration frequently plague refugee operations. An attempt in September 1996 to re-count the Goma camps was suspended when refugees refused to cooperate. The last census in the Goma camps was in February 1995. However, UNHCR, in a statement today said that the population figures had been verified during a joint food assessment mission in October between UNHCR, WFP, observed by EU and USAID. The Uvira and Bukavu camps had been re-counted twice since 1994, the statement added. An over-registration rate of one third would be needed to explain away the &quot;missing refugees&quot;.  Other explanations are: the refugees are hidden in forests and houses, or have moved beyond the 150km zone. Lt Gen Baril said however, that some sorties have been flown up to 225km inside Zaire and no large groups had been picked up. The &quot;numbers issue&quot; remains one of the hottest political issues in the humanitarian crisis in eastern Zaire, with Rwanda, and the ADFL leader Laurent-Desire Kabila, supported in part by major donors, saying all of the non-military refugees who want to come home from Zaire have already done so, and aid agencies openly doubting the vailidity and impartiality of the survey results. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata said in a statement today, &quot;sadly, despite our best efforts, we have not been able to locate substantial numbers of refugees and distressed people out in the forests and hills of Zaire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USA on Wednesday urged Kabila to stop alleged human rights abuses against refugees returning to Rwanda. &quot;The message was essentially the following,&quot; said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns. &quot;The United States is deeply concerned about the allegations of political murders and human rights abuses in eastern Zaire by elements of the rebel alliance.&quot; The USA, he said, would not support &quot;in any way, shape, or form any effort by the rebel alliance to try to create any kind of artificial state in eastern Zaire.  &quot; Burns announced that the rebels had acceded to a US request to allow human rights monitors into the region. AFP cited &quot;witnesses&quot; as saying the mass graves of at least 80 massacred Hutu refugees had been discovered in the Goma region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NGO representative recently returned from Kisangani described the situation at the weekend as relatively tranquil after the local military authorities tried to disarm soldiers arriving from the front. Gunfire broke out, but the situation then calmed down. The representative said it had been possible to buy goods in Kisangani and send them on to Lubutu. He added that media reports about insecurity in Kisangani were somewhat misleading and causing a problem to aid agencies working in the area, as the local authorities accused them of passing on false information rather than helping the people. He said NGOs were hard pressed to explain they were there to render assistance. The situation in Lubutu, where there are some 25,000 displaced people, was described as serious. There was not even one tablet in the local hospital where people were said to be suffering from malaria and diarrhoea. Between 6-10 children were dying daily. After a 500km walk from Bukavu, the strongest people managed to arrive in Kisangani, others were forced to stop in Lubutu and still more very weak people are believed to be between Bukavu and Lubutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuters said that according to civilians arriving in the town of Kasindi from frontlines to the north, the rebels were advancing towards Watsa, Isiro and Kisangani. &quot;Wherever they reach, the local population celebrates and many Zairean soldiers join their ranks,&quot; said one man from Beni. However the consensus among civilians and aid workers on the ground seemed to be that Bunia in the north was still occupied by rampaging Zairean troops.  Missionaries reported that rebels had not yet entered the town but were close by, having reached some 40km south of Bunia. Looting has been reported in Bunia, and a Greek couple were killed by Zairean soldiers for refusing to open their shop to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan troops patrolled Kasindi, 10 kms inside Zairean territory, yesterday after driving out rebels of the Allied Democratic Force (ADF). An army commander, quoted by Reuters, said the rebellion had been &quot;crushed&quot; and his troops would leave in two days' time. He added however that Uganda was seeking guarantees from Zaire that rebels will not continue to launch cross- border attacks. A report on BBC radio today said some 3,000 Zairean soldiers, chased out of Beni, were trying to join up with ADF rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article in the 'New York Times' yesterday said tension was mounting in Mbuji-Mayi, capital of the mineral-rich East Kasai province, as rebels pushed ever closer towards the area, indicating the opening of a new front and a new strategy. Diplomats and aid experts point out that the quest for East Kasai lies at the heart of the rebels' economic plans. The rebels have been quick to reassure foreign mining companies, by announcing they will honour existing mining contracts, but they also intend to remove restrictions on prospecting that have limited opportunities for Zaireans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Tanzania issued an ultimatum for all Rwandan refugees to leave the country by the end of the year, aid workers warned that former soldiers and militiamen in the camps - who have been exhorting refugees not to return - must be separated from innocent people. UNHCR sources told Reuters the Tanzanian government had a list of 200 intimidators who might be separated prior to the repatriation deadline. Lennart Kotsalainen, deputy director of UNHCR's office in Dar es Salaam said radio broadcasts were being made to inform refugees of the departure order. The exiled Hutu organisation Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda (RDR) said returnees were being killed, arrested or were disappearing and that it was in conditions such as these that the mass return from Tanzania would take place. In a statement, issued on Wednesday, RDR again urged the international community to stop its &quot;neverending meetings&quot; and deploy the MNF without delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada and Rwanda are to co-chair a meeting in Kigali on December 13 and 14 to discuss relief needs for hundreds of thousands of Rwandan returnees, Canadian Minister for International Cooperation Don Boudria announced yesterday. UN agencies and NGOs will participate in the meeting, which is a follow-up to the Geneva donors' meeting on November 23. Rwanda has launched an appeal for a total $739,339,000 to resettle returnees, including the expected return from Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders meeting at the Franco-African summit in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, were moving towards a declaration calling for lifting the economic embargo against Burundi, sources close to the summit said yesterday. Meetings were held behind closed doors, but the sources, quoted by AFP, said heads of state were discussing whether to take into account the suffering of Burundi civilians caused by the sanctions. On the Great Lakes crisis, the declaration would call for an international conference on the issue, as well as for the immediate deployment of a multi-national force in eastern Zaire. Japan meanwhile today offered an emergency aid package worth 21.42 million dollars to help refugees and displaced people in eastern Zaire. The package includes 5.5 million dollars for UNHCR, 9.2 million dollars for WFP and 3.8 million dollars for ICRC.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director, Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), to His Excellency Jerry John Rawlings, president of Ghana, December 3, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) strongly protests the November 25 arrest and detention of Opiesie Nkansa-Daaduam, a columnist with the weekly &quot;The Free Press&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkansa-Daaduam is accused of publishing a &quot; subversive and treasonable article&quot; in connection with his article about the televised speech of a military officer, Mr. Akafia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan group of journalists committed to the defense of its colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ is deeply disturbed by the arrest of Nkansa- Daaduam arrest. We condemn this action as a blatant violation of his right to hold and express opinions and ideas. Having written to Your Excellency numerous times earlier this year, we reemphasize our call for an end to the harassment of Ghanaian independent journalists; the elimination of pernicious, anti-press laws, such as Section 185 and criminal libel; and the creation of an environment in which Ghanaian journalists may do their jobs freely and safely. These rights are guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, both to which, we again respectfully remind Your Excellency, Ghana is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your excellency, we urge you to do everything in your power to secure the immediate and unconditional release of Nkansa-Daaduam</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director, Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), to His Excellency President Paul Biya of Cameroon, October 31, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to strongly protest the arrest of Pius Njawe, editor of &quot;Le Messager Popoli&quot;. On October 29, 1996 Pius Njawe was arrested by police at his newspaper's editorial offices.  According to the newspaper's staff, some of the officers were armed. They were led by the head of the judicial police for the Littoral region, Mr. Ondo who had a warrant from the (federal) public prosecutor for Njawe's arrest.  Njawe was not immediately taken to the prison, but held at judicial police headquarters. He was heard by the public prosecutor at 10:00 a.m. on October 30, then taken to the New Bell prison in Douala where he remains in detention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Miano Ngalle, Njawe's lawyer, the arrest is linked to his October 3 conviction for abusing and insulting the President and members of the National Assembly, and for disseminating false news. The Littoral Appeals Court in Douala sentenced him to six months' imprisonment and fined him 100, 000 CFA (1,000 French francs or US$ 200) in connection with a December 1, 1995 editorial and two cartoons published in &quot;Le Messager Popoli&quot; satirizing a constitutional reform project presented by President Paul Biya. Fellow journalist Eyoum Ngangue was sentenced to one year in jail and fined 300,000 CFA (3,000 FF or US$ 600). Both journalists immediately appealed the verdict.  The Supreme Court has yet to make a decision on the appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan organization of journalists committed to the defense of our colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ condemns these actions against the &quot;Le Messager Popoli&quot; journalists as blatant violations of their right to hold and express opinions and ideas. These rights, are guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, to which we respectfully remind Your Excellency, Cameroon is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We urge Your Excellency to do everything within your power to secure the immediate and unconditional release of Pius Njawe and to ensure the media in Cameroon are allowed to carry on their work freely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director, Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), to His Excellency Pascal Lissouba, president of the Republic of Congo, November 20, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) strongly protests the arrest of Ben Ossete Obelas, director of the independent bimonthly &quot;Le Choc&quot;. CPJ is also concerned over the treatment of Obelas while in detention, as he is reportedly not being fed by prison authorities and must rely on those close to him for food and other necessary items.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 4, 1996, Obelas was sentenced to an eight month prison term, four of which are suspended, for &quot;spreading false news and defamation.&quot; Obelas, who defended himself, was taken to the central prison in Brazzaville at the conclusion of his trial at the Brazzaville High Court. The sentence follows the publication, in the October 1-15, 1996 edition of &quot;Le Choc&quot;, of an article accusing the management of the National Social Security Office (CNSS) of embezzlement. The verdict was accompanied by a fine of 250,000 CFA (US$ 500), as well as damages amounting to 2 million CFA (US$ 3,884) granted to the current head of the CNSS, William Desire Dibas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan organization of journalists committed to the defense of our colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ is deeply disturbed by Obelas's arrest and conviction. We condemn such actions against journalists as blatant violations of their right to hold and express opinions and ideas. These rights are guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, to which we respectfully remind Your Excellency, Congo is a signatory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director, Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), to His Excellency President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone, October 24, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to strongly protests the charge of seditious publication against Hilton Fyle, editor of the independent weekly newspaper, &quot;1 2 3&quot;. On October 12, 1996, Hilton Fyle appeared before a Freetown magistrate and was charged with seditious publication in connection with a story published in the October 7 edition of &quot; 1 2 3&quot;, alleging that justice officials had accepted bribes to drop a fraud case against a former foreign minister and a businessman. Fyle, a former announcer with the British Broadcasting Corporation's Africa Service, pleaded not guilty to three counts of publishing a false report likely to cause alarm.  He was freed on bail of 8 million leones (US $8,000).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan organization of journalists committed to the defense of our colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ condemns this action against Fyle as a blatant violation of his right to hold and express opinions and ideas. We respectfully remind your Excellency that Sierra Leone ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 19 of which guarantees the right to &quot;seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kind.&quot; These rights are also guaranteed by Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, to which we again respectfully remind Your Excellency, Sierra Leone is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPJ condemns the use of seditious libel statues because they are used exclusively to silence dissent against governing regimes. These laws do not have any place in a democratic society because democratic societies do not criminalize critical reporting_they tolerate and protect it. The right to speak freely without fear of government reprisal is at the very heart of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPJ considers Fyle's arrest to be a serious infringement of press freedom in Sierra Leone and calls for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the charges against him. We urge Your Excellency to guarantee the protection of journalists' sources and the media's right to practice their profession freely and safely. This is especially crucial in light of Sierra Leone's recent transition to democratic rule.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Excellency President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah State House Freetown, Sierra Leone BY FAX: 011-232-22-242126</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to express its outrage at the Parliament's October 11, 1996 conviction without trial of Sheka Parawali, editor of the independent daily, &quot;Torchlight&quot;. Parawali appeared before Parliament to answer charges of contempt of Parliament in connection with the story entitled &quot;Kabbah Bribes MPs&quot; carried in the October 8 issue of the newspaper. He was sentenced to one month in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The owner of &quot;Torchlight&quot;, Reverend Y.M. Koroma, who is also an MP, withdrew his financial support for the paper stating that he could not support the newspaper with its current cadre of reporters. Koroma also requested that the Minister of Information withdraw the newspaper's publishing license and order the newspaper to cease publishing immediately.  Parawali, who still plans to continue publishing &quot;Torchlight&quot; was informed by C.P.C. Printing Company, owned by another MP, Dr. Jengo Stevens, that it would no longer print the newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan group of journalists dedicated to the promotion of press freedom worldwide, CPJ is deeply disturbed by this attack on Torchlight.  Furthermore, we are astonished that Sheka Parawali was convicted without trial by an official outside the house of justice and we believe that his conviction and the C.P.C Printing Company's refusal to publish the newspaper was a response to the journalist exercising this right to hold and express opinions. We respectfully remind your Excellency that Sierra Leone ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A proposal to hold truth hearings into the media has provoked much argument, writes Jacquie Golding-Duffy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE is consensus among editors that the media should be investigated for the role it played during the apartheid era, but there are differing opinions on whether the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is the correct platform for the press to confess all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suggestion that a special week-long truth and reconciliation hearing be held on the role of the media was proposed by journalist, Human Rights Committee member and truth commission employee, Hugh Lewin. The proposal hopes to highlight the possible role the media played in creating and sustaining a climate where gross human rights violations occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former political prisoner, Lewin asked the Freedom of Expression Institute (FXI) to make a recommendation on the appropriateness of the TRC holding hearings at which the role of the media would be scrutinised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in a draft proposal the FXI says it is in favour of the commission conducting hearings and recommends that it &quot;specifically investigate&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the laws which were used to control or regulate the media;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the role of Parliament, Cabinet and the judiciary in enhancing and enforcing these laws;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the role of states of emergencies and specific media emergency measures in controlling the media;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the role of the South African Broadcasting Corporation as a state- controlled broadcaster; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the role of privately-owned media.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FXI suggests that the TRC compile a separate report relating specifically to the media, adding that the assistance of non- governmental organisations has to be requested to ensure thorough research prior to public hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The consequences in terms of gross human rights violations as a result of state control and regulation of the media should be recorded to serve as a warning to present and future governments about the importance of preserving a free, diverse and independent media,&quot; said FXI executive director Jeanette Minnie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the editor of the Sunday Independent, John Battersby, says it &quot;is a sound and necessary idea&quot;, the editor of Rapport, Izak De Villiers, &quot;cannot see the point&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Battersby says the media should not be exempt from telling its story, but he admits that there are differing opinions on how this process should be handled, adding that the TRC will face the same difficulties in the media as that of the security forces - an unwillingness by some perpetrators to come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the pressure can be intensified if some people are subpoenaed.  Omitting the media has allowed for a gap in the TRC process,&quot; he argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Battersby outlines three categories where an investigation into the media could take place:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An investigation into what ways the media used in criminalising legitimate opposition to apartheid. The press criminalised the fight for freedom in the way it reported, selected and presented its news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The TRC could look into ways the media assisted in government disinformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* How the media failed to be accountable to the public - it was accountable to the government of the day and the minority of readers who were able to keep the Nationalist Party government in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Villiers, however, disagrees with Battersby. He says he is &quot;not enthusiastic about the TRC&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My point of view is that if certain crimes are committed, crimes that can be proven, those people should be taken to court. One is innocent until proven guilty ... therefore the press should use the courts of law vigorously and exploit our new Constitution if it wants to do it right now,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Villiers argues that the issue of exposing a network of informers operating within the press in the past is pointless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why expose murderers and informers of the past. Will that stop crime now?  There will always be informers until thy kingdom come and until the archbishop (Desmond Tutu) can convince me that the press will do its job properly and crime will be curbed by us coming to the TRC. Until such time, I am not interested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Times editor Moegsien Williams says the press appearing before the TRC is an &quot;intriguing idea&quot;, but argues that an appearance before the TRC has to be accompanied by a proper investigation into the role of the media during the dark apartheid years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Coming to the TRC will be useful as it will afford the public the opportunity to take a closer look at the media and possibly understand the role they played during apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The TRC will at one level expose the collaboration of the media, and on another level it will highlight the courageous standards of journalism that existed at the time,&quot; says Williams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds that the TRC has its hands full at the moment and should not be expanding its brief to include the press. However, an investigation into the media, under the auspices of the FXI, for example, would be useful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams believes that a commission into the press will bode well for the industry as it has to re-establish credibility with the general public and redefine its role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sowetan editor Mike Siluma agrees. He says that it is clear that the press has to re- evaluate its role, now that we have a democratic government in place; but he argues that before we can move forward the media has to clear up the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My personal view is that the press is no different from other social institutions and therefore the media should not have special status in the eyes of the TRC. It is of utmost importance that the media confess to whatever ills it committed in the past.&quot; Siluma says the media has a &quot;helluva lot&quot; to account for as it could have done a lot of things differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We could have fought silently. We need not have called the African National Congress &quot;terrorists&quot;, we could have insisted on giving (Nelson) Mandela an honorific. We, as the press, were guilty of smearing the very people who were fighting for our freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy editor of Beeld, Tim du Plessis, agrees with Siluma that the media should not be treated differently: &quot;I am not saying it is a good or bad thing. All I'm saying is that it is necessary in some respects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The press is an institution of civil society such as churches and banks.  If we can urge the churches to go before the TRC, then the press can do the same,&quot; says Du Plessis, adding that this did not mean he was going to appear before the TRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I go, then so must all whites because you cannot just say: I did not vote for the system. This does not matter. You may not have voted, but you benefitted from the system. Everyone should admit that they maintained a system that allowed people like Eugene De Kock and Ferdi Barnard to operate.  They believed everything they read in the newspapers because they chose to believe it. The press should have been questioned more and the TRC will grant people this opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Commonwealth Press Union conference held recently, TRCchair Desmond Tutu, referring to the media, said it is &quot;quite brave in its criticism of the new government&quot;, although the same press &quot;was coy about saying boo to a goose in the old days&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutu says there is quite rightly resentment in government circles at the media's new zeal for criticism when the press was &quot;somewhat less courageous in the old days. I must say I share some of that resentment.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Mail &amp; Guardian 1996 Student Media Award for the best student newspaper was won by the University of Cape Town for its publication, Varsity. The newspaper won as it offered &quot;the most diverse look at campus life&quot;, with stories of the state of resident housing and controversies on campus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judges included M&amp;G co-founder Irwin Manoim (now head of the daily eM&amp;G) and two representatives from the Institute for the Advancement of Journalism, Cheryl Carpenter and Tisha Steyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together the judges found that Varsity used several different journalistic forms ranging from question and answer during interviews with university officials and vox-pops with students to articles on issues of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best upcoming student newspaper was Agitate, Liberal Students Society from Wits University, for its simple but effective black and white front covers and the accomplished handling of long features and witty cartoons by students. Agitate also showed real editing, graphic and writing flair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The award for best student journalist went to Carien du Plessis of Die Matie, University of Stellenbosch. Du Plessis writes both in English and Afrikaans and the judges found her articles well-researched and informative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magriet Theron of Die Perdeby, University of Pretoria, won the best student photographer award for versatility and her ability to manage a variety of different types of pictures, including news, arts and portraiture.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In case you haven't noticed (ha!), it's holiday season again.  Note, I didn't say &quot;Christmas season&quot;. That's because the Western world is finally accepting that December has spiritual meaning to more than just one religious group, and that the &quot;festive season&quot; is festive not only for Christians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This doesn't mean you have to fall for the political correctness trap of desperately avoiding mentioning Christmas to someone who may or may not celebrate it. It does mean, however, that at this time of year the other PC - the one you use to go sleigh-riding (oops) on the web - is a source of tremendous cross-cultural and cross-festive knowledge about how various cultures will be indulging themselves this, er, holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's start with the least known in South Africa, but a festival that is becoming increasingly meaningful in North America, namely Kwanzaa, an &quot; African-American spiritual holiday&quot; which was initiated on December 26 1966, and now lasts for seven days from the day after Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is based on the cultural principles of a theory called Kawaida, which has the premise that &quot;social revolutionary change for Black America can be achieved by the act of revealing and disclosing individuals to their cultural heritage&quot;, according to the Kwanzaa Information Center (http://www.melanet.  com/kwanzaa/) on the web.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site explains the inspiration behind Kwanzaa, its history, development and current expression, and provides an insight into why it has caught on to such an extent in the United States. Kwanzaa cards are almost as easily available as Christmas cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much the same applies to Chanukah (or Hanukkah, as the palate-challenged Americans prefer), the Festival of Lights celebrated in early December by Jews the world over. You won't find many of these cards in South African stores, but you can on the web at Greet Street (http://www.greetst.com/), and among any number of other resources on the web - including online shops. Here you can buy a dreidel, a traditional four-sided spinning top that is always hauled out for the kids during the festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jewish Communication Network has even put up a Hanukkah site (http: &nbsp;//www.jcn18.com/holiday/hanukkah/index .htm) which includes the Internet's first Virtual Dreidel - available in Netscape animation and as a regular edition. The site also explains &quot;the history they never taught you&quot; and includes a &quot;Hanukkah how-to&quot; and a &quot;Hanukkah Carol Competition&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the latter reminds you of your own celebrations, then why, you must be part of that spin-off sect that celebrates Santa Claus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seriously, though, the amount of Christmas sites and resources on the web dwarfs anything that any other religion could even contemplate right now.  We'll spend some time at the best of those sites next week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Finance Week has been buoying its circulation figures by sending about 2 000 copies of the publication each week to hotel chain City Lodge, which in exchange enjoys free advertising in the financial magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means 15% of all Finance Week copies sold - R12 000 worth - are given away to readers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Audit Bureau of Circulation (ABC), the ailing publication, which was recently acquired by former Financial Mail (FM) editor-at-large David Gleason, recorded an average weekly sales count of 13 691 in the six months to June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Lodge managing director Clifford Ross this week confirmed the barter arrangement. He said Finance Week provided magazines for certain hotel rooms as well as an additional replacement pile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABC chair Rory Macnamara said from July this year &quot;bulk sales&quot; such as these would be clearly flagged. Gleason had not commented at the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal was struck last year by Stuart Murray who resigned as managing director of the publication on Tuesday, just weeks after Gleason's takeover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gleason's acquisition of the magazine paved the way for the defection of former FM editor Nigel Bruce, who replaced Murray as editor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magazine, which was bought by Gleason for an undisclosed sum, lost about R2- million in the latest financial year. Gleason has refused to disclose the identity of his backers or comment on rumours about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speculation has centred almost entirely around Randgold, the most likely candidate being Swiss banker Jean-Antoine Cramer, a director of the mining group, and managing director Brett Kebble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains unclear whether any other FM staffers will follow Bruce and Gleason to Finance Week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - King Goodwill Zwelithini pulled out of a consortium bidding for KwaZulu-Natal's new private sound radio station last week because he didn't know what he was getting into, say royal family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zwelithini mysteriously dropped his 5% stake and yanked his endorsement for Radio One - one of two consortiums bidding for the station at an Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) application hearing in Durban last week - shortly after the hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The monarch's legal advisor S'dumo Mathe said the decision followed &quot;new facts revealed during the (IBA) hearing&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal family members say the monarch was ill-informed about the implications of his endorsement prior to the hearing and &quot;had no idea his letter of endorsement written in February 1995 would be used to support an application or that this bid was being opposed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been established that the monarch had given his blessing to Radio One's proposed Zulu-language radio station when he was approached by one-time Inkatha Freedom Party business consultant Laurence Anthony. Radio One will have 90% of its programmes in Zulu with a format which is a combination of talk and music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony contacted Zwelithini via another family member last year. &quot;What the king didn't know is that his support would be used to bolster Radio One's black empowerment credentials in competition with another black empowerment consortium,&quot; said one source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The monarch was also apparently unaware his trust would have to purchase the 5% stake &quot;which only came into the picture in the run-up to the hearing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Profits accruing to the trust through which the shares would be held were intended for development projects. Radio One's Anthony - a 20% shareholder in the consortium together with electronics firm Push (35%), Boland Financial Services (25%), electronic media consultants Cognas (5%) and City Press (15%) - said the consortium &quot;understands the reasons for (Zwelithini's) decision to withdraw and we support his decision&quot;, but declined to comment on the reasons behind the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony said the king's proposed stake was to have formed part of a 40% black empowerment shareholding which would include City Press - provided negotiations now under way for a black consortium including former IFP secretary-general Oscar Dhlomo's Dynamo Investments to purchase the newspaper were successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony argued the radio bid's competition &quot;ceased to be an issue&quot; after the IBA refused to hear the application of competing consortium KZNfm last week. &quot;They can't be heard again on the same application,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBA representative Amos Vilikazi disagreed: &quot;When an application is not heard on a technical reason, that does not nullify the application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA agreed to hear KZNfm's bid early next year after public notification procedures are met,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KZNfm will have a ratio of 70% Zulu to 30% English language programmes. It will play mostly local music catering for 15 to 35- year-olds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vilikazi said the IBA decision not to hear the KZNfm bid was not related to earlier reports that the two consortiums were contemplating a merger on the eve of the hearings: &quot;They officially informed a merger was being contemplated, but they arrived at the hearings as two separate entities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony said the two had &quot;held loose talks&quot; on a possible merger, but had decided against the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony says his share in Radio One (via a trust) was &quot;totally unrelated&quot; to his family's ownership of the Empangeni-based Zululand Observer newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Durban the IBA will issue one new FM licence and no MW licence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The competition for an FM licence has begun in Cape Town, with former political prisoners pitted against black businessmen, writes Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHILE there are only two competitors for the licence for Cape Town's first new FM commercial radio station, both have so much in their favour that the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) will find it hard to make a choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio P4/Zebra FM, a consortium of former political prisoners in conjunction with a Norwegian radio station, is vying against Cape Classic Hits FM, a local consortium led by Peter Jones, a man who makes it his job to push black commercial interests, and is known to have been a good friend of Steve Biko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Radio P4/Zebra FM is dedicating itself to jazz, Cape Classic Hits is aiming for a jazzy Cape Town sound, music liked by wealthy Capetonians between the ages of 20 and 45, and a dose of hard-hitting news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the face of it, Radio P4/Zebra FM is the most politically correct of the two applicants. Eighty percent of the consortium is owned by the Mokana Trust, which was set up for the benefit of ex-political prisoners, many of whom have failed to find a niche in new South African society.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other 20% is owned by a Norwegian Radio Station, Radio P4 International AS, which was recently listed on the Norwegian Stock Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member of the board of directors, John Nassel-Henderson, said should the application be successful, his group would have to negotiate funding to set up the radio station, possibly with Noraid, a Norwegian funding agency. The political prisoners are too poor to fund the setting up of the station itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nassel-Henderson said Radio P4/Zebra FM hoped to employ ex-political prisoners at the station, should they show talent behind the mike or in the running of the radio station. Expertise and training would come from the Norwegian shareholder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We spent a lot of time working out how it should look and looking at real empowerment, because often the word empowerment has come to mean the same guys get rich over and over again,&quot; said Nassel-Henderson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This comment could be interpreted as a backhander at Nassel-Henderson's opposition, Cape FM Classic Hits, partly owned by top black Capetonian businessmen and achievers. Capetonian Peter Jones is co-ordinating the application by Classic Hits and is the managing director of Mnyama Holdings, which owns 40% of the consortium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones is confident of winning the race for the licence, thanks to his Cape Town-based movers and shakers. These include Khayelitsha-based businessman Sam Dube, president of the Black Management Forum, Gavin Pieterse, and Nombulelo Mkefa, executive director of the Community Peace Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not trading on political sympathies. We are all people with a long history in political endeavour and we are selling competence and a local profile.&quot; Jones said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Dublin-based company, Radio Investments, owns 20% of the consortium and would provide international expertise should Cape Classic Hits FM win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Irish company owns a radio station in Dublin called 98FM and four radio stations in Czechoslovakia. Jones says it will cost R8,5-million to launch the radio station with 39 staffers. They expect to have a news department along with DJs, entertainers, producers, managers and accountants. He adds that every shareholder will put up his or her percentage of the capital from the outset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already the tension between these two competitors is brewing with Nassel- Henderson accusing Cape Classic Hits FM of poaching their jazz idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There is a huge thirst for jazz in Cape Town, and even our competitors for the licence have realised this, and want to include jazz into their application now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones said that they were looking for a jazzy, mellow sound, but was contemptuous of Radio P4/Zebra FM's application on the grounds that the consortium was based in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our application for a Cape Town radio station is the only one in front of the IBA which is driven by a truly home-grown team. The others are largely dependent on expertise from Johannesburg,&quot; said Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA will also be awarding two medium- wave licences in Cape Town, apart from the one FMlicence. The contenders for the MW licences are Punt op Mediumgolf, an Afrikaans talk radio, with Boland Financial Services as one of the financial backers; World Sport, which includes the MoriboConsortium (Thebe Investments); Radio Discovery of the Property Limited Consortium; and Cape Talk, which is the Newshelf Consortium.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Managing director of Associated Magazines and Jane Raphaely &amp; Associates, editor and publisher of Femina, House and Leisure and editor-in- chief of Cosmopolitan, JANE RAPHAELY sees herself as one of the Irish gals in River Dance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which television programmes do you watch most often and why? Carte Blanche because it's always breaking good stories and gets my creative juices flowing ... I absolutely adored Cracker and have withdrawal pains from Absolutely Fabulous and Prime Suspect. Also Soul City is fantastic and Egoli is contagious. The truth and reconciliation hearings are compelling in a heartbreaking way and Prime Evil was gruesomely fascinating.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which book have you recently read that you would recommend? Margaret Atwood's Alias Grace and Alan Furst's The Polish Officer. The former is a wonderful Canadian novelist and Furst, also from Canada, writes a fascinating historical novel which allows for an amazingly vivid recollection of a war- time period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which radio stations do you listen to and why? I listen to Radio 702 and SAfm. Also, a wonderful local Cape Town radio station - Sine Music Radio - which plays jazz and classical music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you surf the World Wide Web of the Internet? No, because I think its 90% rubbish and takes far too long to access the 10% that isn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is your favourite advertisement and why? The new Calvin Klein and Chanel Allure campaign. The use of black and white is done beautifully and the print campaigns are clean and modern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which newspapers and magazines do you regularly read? I read virtually every local newspaper. On the magazine front, I obviously look at all my magazines before they get into print. I also enjoy Getaway and Out There for escapism. I keep a sharp eye on Tribute and True Love and all other competition. I really enjoy Premier and Entertainment Weekly and Big Screen as I'm mad about films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you could be any film star or fictional character, who would you be and why? One of the Irish girls in River Dance. I would not mind a female role opposite George Clooney as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Generally circulation for newspapers is down (January to June 1996 ABC figures) for dailies as well as for weeklies. Weeklies are down from 2 585 616 in 1993 to 2 250 550 in 1996 (-12,9%) and dailies are down from 1 427 767 to 1 193 751 for the same period (- 16,4%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weeklies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THOSE which have shown growth are the Afrikaans weeklies, the Mail &amp; Guardian, City Press and Week-end Post. It would appear that publications which target a specific audience though their editorial content have a successful formula.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further analysis of the All Media Product Survey (AMPS) on the regularity of readership - that is, how many issues within a issue period are read - reveals that regularity of readership has remained consistent with the Afrikaans weeklies - over 60% of their readers read every issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While regular white readership has remained the same, black regular readership has declined since 1993 on average by 21,4% across all newspapers, even City Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dailies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE same analysis for the dailies indicates a similar trend in terms of circulation. Those which have increased circulation include the Afrikaans dailies, Business Day, Sowetan, EP Herald and D.F. Advertiser. However, regular readership of dailies among blacks is down, except for Pretoria News which has more regular black readers than it does white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other dailies with an increasing regular black readership are Cape Times, The Argus, Evening Post, Business Day and EP Herald. EP Herald has increased its regular readership base among both black and white readers. Its circulation for the daily edition is also increasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regular black readership is down for the other English dailies, even The Star, The Citizen and Sowetan. While regular white readership is up for some newspapers, it is down for the Western Cape papers and some of the KwaZulu- Natal newspapers. The Afrikaans dailies have maintained their regular readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conclusions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE above demonstrates a number of factors: firstly, those newspapers whose circulations have increased tend to have a high level of loyal readers and this must be because editorials are relevant to its readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, newspapers with higher subscription levels tend to maintain their regular readers, thus newspapers must promote their growth in the future through subscriptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, from a media planning perspective, because of the lower incidence of regular readership among the black community, repetition of adverts is far more critical in order to achieve a high &quot;hit&quot; rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; Lyndall Campher, Hunt Lascaris group media director, will give a fortnightly analysis of print media circulation, alternating with M&amp;G media editor Jacquie Golding-Duffy's look at television ratings</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - With the Appellate Division ruling in favour of Caxton, the Independent and Times Media groups have a fight on their hands, report Jacquie Golding-Duffy and David Shapshak</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TIMES MEDIA LIMITED'S (TML) management are unable to agree on the implications of the Appellate Division judgment reached in favour of printing and publishing group Caxton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment, which marked the end of a five-year battle between Caxton and Independent Newspapers, formerly Argus Newspapers, is also expected to stymie TML's plans to link up with Pearson, owner of the London Financial Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battle revolved around Independent's distribution of regional supplements in contravention of a 1980 restraint agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But TML managers, depending on whether or not they are in favour of the Pearsons deal, see the Caxton judgment differently.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outgoing TML managing director Roy Paulson indicated in rival business publication, Business Report, earlier this week, that Pearson would want to resolve areas of uncertainty before completing the deal with TML, adding that &quot;this could take months&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the following day in TML's own financial daily, Business Day, the stable's financial director, Lawrence Clarke, contradicted Paulson, saying the judgment is unlikely to jeopardise the proposed deal with Pearsons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the article, Clarke said TML was still negotiating with Pearson and was &quot; getting close to finality&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long-vaunted deal between TML and Pearson will see the latter acquire a 50% stake in Financial Mail and Business Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is understood that Pearson is considering bidding solely for Business Day because it is nervous about the changes and upheaval which have occurred of late at Financial Mail, resulting in its editor, Nigel Bruce, and editor-at-large, David Gleason, jumping ship for a rival publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pearson, which was due to seal the deal with TML on Thursday, did not do so.  Terry Moolman, Caxton's joint managing director, told a Mail &amp; Guardian reporter that he was still making up his mind about whether his company would apply for an injunction to stop the Pearson deal going ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he admitted to advising Pearson not to proceed without consulting him. &quot; All we're saying is 'let's just think about this',&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moolman said the deal with Pearson, for an undisclosed sum, may go ahead sometime in the future but only with Caxton at the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent Group, which acquired Argus Newspapers in 1994, was hardest hit by the judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will have to retrench employees on its regional supplements, magazines and freesheets. It is believed that 15 employees have already been told that they will be out of a job by the year-end, although 11 vacancies have been created in the company for which the retrenchees can apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Gauteng Newspapers' managing director Deon Du Plessis was quoted as saying the company will not send people out on to the street and that every effort will be made to find them jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caxton joint managing director Noel Coburn says Caxton is still planning to sue the Independent Group for damages and lost revenue during the years that The Star ran regional supplements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regional supplements caused Caxton to suffer a major financial loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had a very aggressive pricing policy which took quite a lot of advertising money away from us. If they (the supplements) had not been there, that advertising money would have come to us,&quot; says Coburn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds that the court found the restraint of trade still valid, despite the change of ownership where Argus Newspapers became Independent Newspapers with subdivisions including Gauteng and Natal Newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like a servitude which is valid despite a change of ownership. The fact that the shareholders have changed does not release the contractual obligations of business,&quot; he said, adding that the agreement was breached by the Independent Group without any consultation with Caxtons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They never came to talk to us. We went to them on our knees. Documents show we proposed a negotiated settlement and they weren't interested. They've done extremely well out of us over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the court found the agreement valid and binding, we are in a strong position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coburn would not say whether Caxton would now pursue TML's magazine group, a move that has been rumoured in the media industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've not looked at the judgment for any further implications. We have to think about the options. I can't say nothing has been contemplated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he has warned that the group may be speculating on how the original agreement affects Gauteng Newspapers's magazine ventures -such as the Sunday Life insert in the Sunday Independent and other magazines in the provisionally liquidated Penta Publications, including, among others, De Kat and Tribute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have drawn attention to them (Gauteng Newspapers) that there are clauses in the (1980 restraint of trade) agreement that we want obeyed. We believe if they continue magazine publishing then we could go back to court.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Is there such a thing as international competitiveness? Paul Krugman thinks many of the arguments are bunk. Ben Laurance looks at his thesis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEBATES about international trade are, Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests, &quot;a study in confusion and misconceptions, in which the 'experts' are usually misinformed about the most basic facts and concepts&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He goes on: &quot;The idea that the economic success of a country depends on its international competitiveness took hold in the late 1970s. The World Economic Forum began issuing its World Competitiveness Report in 1980, and the rankings in that report soon became a major criterion by which national performance was judged. By the 1990s, the concept was no longer even controversial. Competitiveness was the key; the only question was how to achieve it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krugman argues that people who use the term believe &quot;nations compete for world markets in the same way that corporations do, that a nation which fails to match other nations in productivity or technology will face the same kind of crisis as a company that cannot match the costs of products of its rivals&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, says Krugman, the suggestion that countries compete like companies is a poor analogy. And within the muddle of the debate, he suggests, it is possible to discern four types of combatant: the Mercantilist, the Classicist, the Strategist, and the Realist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l THE MERCANTILIST believes the purpose of trade is to generate exports, which create jobs; if he has any sympathy for free trade, it is because we can make a deal to accept other countries' exports if they accept ours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The vast majority of those who use the term (competitiveness) are Mercantilists. Anyone who writes about trade as a global struggle or war; anyone who says that trade policy is about creating jobs; anyone who talks about 'high value' sectors: all of these people reveal themselves to be Mercantilists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay Round were sold politically not on the basis of economists' estimates of the gains from trade, but with the claim that the extra exports thereby generated would add hundreds of thousands of jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* THE CLASSICIST, essentially a follower of the model postulated by David Ricardo and developed by John Stuart Mill: that the purpose of trade is imports, not exports. &quot;An export is an indirect way to produce an import, which is worth doing because it is more efficient than producing our imports for ourselves. It is almost exactly the opposite of what Mercantilists believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* THE STRATEGIST, in Krugman's view, has an objection to the classical position &quot;which can be summarised in two words: Silicon Valley&quot;. The basic classical model assumes perfect competition. But there are industries in which economies of scale imply that only a few, perhaps highly profitable, firms dominate the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Krugman: &quot;There are industries in which technological prowess seems to be generated by the mutual spill-overs of knowledge from national producers, and in which exports, therefore, may create comparative advantage, rather than the other way around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* THE REALIST understands how the Classicists' and Mercantilists' views collide and how the qualifications to classical trade theory create new, more subtle, arguments for intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What distinguishes the Realist from the Strategist is two beliefs. First, the Realist has looked at the practical prospects for strategic trade policy and found them unimpressive: while markets are indeed imperfect, the potential gains from trying to exploit these imperfections are, he believes, essentially small change. Second, the Realist is cynical about the likelihood that subtle arguments for intervention can be translated into productive policies in the real world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krugman, not surprisingly, declares himself a Realist. In too many cases, he says, reports and newspaper articles on competitiveness contain statements like these: growth of economies in Asia necessarily comes at the expense of the West; and if our foreign rivals become more productive than we are across the board, we will have nothing that we can produce competitively and our standard of living will collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such statements are silly, yet they attract nods of agreement, says Krugman.  Why? Because too many observers fail to see that everything in the economy affects everything else in at least two ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For example, the amateur pundit on international trade typically thinks of wages as a given, and so imagines that productivity growth in low-wage countries must always come at the expense of jobs elsewhere; or he thinks in terms of a world market of fixed size, in which one country's increased output can come only by crowding out production and jobs in other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if one understands even the simplest textbook model of comparative advantage, one already has a picture of a world in which wages, prices, the pattern of specialisation and production, and the size of the world market are all simultaneously and mutually determined; in which productivity growth will feed back to wages; in which output growth will feed back to demand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So having arrived at a defence of classicism, what has to be added to the mix to make up some of the so-called new trade theories?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the new theory: &quot;Differences between countries are one reason for trade, but countries may trade because there are inherent advantages to specialisation. The economies of scale in aircraft manufacture are so large that the world market can accommodate at best only a few efficient- scale producers and thus only a few centres of production. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So which country, in this case, becomes the aircraft producer? &quot;In the new theory, an important element of arbitrariness is added to this story. Why are aircraft manufactured in Seattle? The logic of increasing returns mandates that aircraft production be concentrated somewhere, and Seattle just happens to be where the roulette wheel came to a stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new trade theory suggests that in export subsidies, temporary tariffs and other measures may shift world production in a way favourable to the protecting nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, says Krugman, few of the new trade theorists can be described as Strategists, because the new trade theorists are generally Realists. The Realist &quot;does not share the interventionist propensities of the Strategist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There is a big difference between knowing lots of facts and really knowing how a market works. And worse yet, if you should figure out aircraft, you will find that little of that knowledge generalises to computers, which are in turn utterly different from telecommunications, which do not at all resemble software.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continues: &quot;Even if you think you understand an industry well enough to devise an activist policy, or are willing for the sake of argument to assume that your model is really good enough, estimates of the gains from strategic trade policies are almost always very small.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Krugman suggests, there is a third reason why new trade theorists tend to be generally non-interventionist Realists: policymakers are unlikely to understand any of this. &quot;Almost everyone who matters is a Mercantilist.  What this means is that the Strategist who goes to politicians with clever ideas for strategic trade policies is kidding himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He may imagine that they value the content of his ideas. In fact, they value him because what he says seems to confirm their Mercantilist views, and absolves them from the need to understand even classical, let alone 'new' trade theory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krugman's conclusion is clear and contemptuous: &quot;Most of us would like to believe that great public debates are driven by serious intellectual concerns.  We would therefore like to believe that if famed intellectuals and powerful politicians talk about competitiveness, they must have something meaningful in mind. It seems far too cynical to suggest that the debate is simply a matter of time-honoured fallacies about international trade dressed up in new and pretentious rhetoric.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The big guns are out, but this time they are profiting from protecting the wildlife. Eddie Koch reports on the phenomenal growth of the Conservation Corporation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN Dave Varty opened his company's newest lodge on the banks of the Zambezi River last month, he identified a phenomenon that is helping to fuel exponential growth in Africa's game-lodge industry. &quot;What made this possible is that a lot of wealthy banks and finance institutions have realised that it makes economic sense to invest their money in projects that protect the dwindling wildlife of Africa,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That mechanism is, in essence, the lever that has converted Conservation Corporation Africa (CCA) in just six years from a family-owned set of Lowveld lodges into a multinational corporation operating 20 of the most luxurious lodges south of the Sahara. It employs about 2 500 people and manages 350 000ha of the continent's most valuable wildlife real estate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company - valued at US$65-million (about R300-million) and probably the only corporation of its type in the world - sees itself as being so successful that it plans to expand into the wilderness of South, and possibly even North, America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also planning a stock exchange listing next year in London or the United States. According to one director, CCA is becoming &quot;the world's Microsoft of ecotourism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sceptics in South Africa's conservation industry say this kind of phenomenal growth is unrealistic. Since 1990, when the corporation was formed to take over the Phinda Private Game Reserve in northern KwaZulu-Natal, it has acquired six lodges and a hotel in East Africa, two lodges on the Zambezi in Zimbabwe - and a small island off the coast of Zanzibar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the middle of this year, CCA acquired all three of Southern Sun's game lodges and began operating a lodge at Tswalu in the Kalahari, South Africa's largest private game reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talks are now under way with Wilderness Safaris to take over at least another two lodges in KwaZulu-Natal's wilderness areas, and the company is spearheading a drive with the Natal Parks Board to make the long- awaited Greater St Lucia National Park become a reality in that province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That kind of growth is just impossible to sustain. With so many beds opening up in new lodges, each of CCA's operations simply won't be able to run at the kind of occupancy rates that are required to make them profitable.  It seems it is relying on soft money in the form of investment by noble financiers who are willing to take risks and less return on their money in order to be able to say they did something good for Africa's wildlife,&quot; says a wildlife and tourism consultant who asked not to be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That perception is not borne out, however, by company statistics. An official release notes that total available bed nights sold have grown from 23 627 in 1992 to 94 000 in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Average occupancies have escalated from about 60% in 1992, the kind of figure that causes some commentators to question the profitability of some lodges, to well over 80% in 1996 - all at an average rate of a whopping US$225 (more than R1 000) a night, which is expected to generate a turnover of US$33,5-million (about R155-million) in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CCA's deputy chairman, Alan Bernstein, says the criticisms are a &quot; subjective view&quot;, which &quot;fail to take account of years of research by investment analysts into CCA's revenue earning potential&quot;. He adds it is not short-term operational profits that account for the company's skyrocketing performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The international investment scene is showing an appetite for investment in the natural resources of the southern hemisphere. Ecotourism is increasingly interesting from a number of perspectives, including the ability to generate medium- term returns but also to create a viable and long-term industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real success of CCA, says Bernstein, lies in its growing ability to behave and perform in a way that attracts equity investment from international capital markets. This long-term endeavour, rather than immediate pressures to boost the occupancy rates of its new lodges, is where the company's strategic accent lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe there is an appetite for people of the northern hemisphere to participate in the lifestyle and natural-resource based products and services that people of the underdeveloped world can offer. CCA is essentially about setting up partnerships between the holders of capital internationally and the holders of natural resources in Africa, with ecotourism creating the best opportunity for structuring those partnerships.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In exchange, investors can expect to earn a return on their equity in the high 20% bracket over the medium term, possibly escalating to the high 30s.  But a new surge of international investment into other sectors of the game- lodge industry could also create competition problems for CCA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month the Dubai-based Dolphin Group announced it was preparing to spend between R300 and R400-million on more than 25 new game lodges in Mpumalanga -indicating that there could soon be too many beds to fill in South Africa's game parks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not concerned about the proliferation of lodges,&quot; says Bernstein. &quot; The Kruger National Park, which is the size of Switzerland, has a total of 4 000 beds in its lodges. That is the capacity of four or five big Swiss hotels.  I believe we haven't even scratched the surface in terms of the tourism potential for Africa's wildlife. Tourism to the entire African continent amounts to just 4% of global tourism, which is growing rapidly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - NGO Week saw the sector calling for more control over funding and policies, reports Aspasia Karras</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE choice of Rand Afrikaans University as the venue for NGO Week set the tone for the ironic paradigm shift the sector has been forced to make since 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The megalithic laager hosted 500 delegates, representing an estimated 30 000 non- governmental organisations (NGOs) in South Africa. Formed in an &quot; unashamedly&quot; anti- government spirit, they met to discuss the critical issues facing them today, including the fact that many old comrades are now in government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key issues were the need to define the confusing relationship with the government; to understand where the funds (or lack thereof) are coming from; and to develop some cohesion in the sector to position themselves strategically in the policy- making processes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Minister of Public Works Jeff Radebe acknowledged that NGOs are autonomous and play a critical role in the development process, the lines of authority and communication are never clear. And in the wake of the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), and attempts to save the situation through new consultations about a National Development Agency (NDA) - which will attempt to formalise interaction between the government and NGOs - defining relationships becomes more important than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kumi Naidoo, executive director of the South African National NGO Coalition, which convened the conference, says: &quot;Next year, we must come out fighting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argues for a critical re-evaluation of the NGO sector to enable them to take on the practical challenges facing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues of human resource development, financial management, strategic planning and globalisation are, in fact, the same challenges facing South African organisations unilaterally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naidoo says: &quot;First, NGOs must recognise that they are not intended to be mass providers of services, but rather creative entities, generating new, more sustainable forms of development. Our weakness is that we have not learnt how to translate localised experiments into policy. So policy is made in a vacuum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Naidoo is not doing is allowing himself and others to be drawn into victim talk. &quot;How can we be effective, professional and coherent if we see ourselves as victims? Yes, the environment has changed, and we have seen the death of some really good NGOs. But we need to become pro-active and really understand our environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sentiment heartily endorsed by Community Agency for Social Enquiry (Case) director Dr David Everatt. &quot;For 11 years Case has been recording the thoughts and aspirations of the poorest of the poor. In the new context, when we compete for tenders against private, market-driven companies, it's like chalk and cheese. Both in quality and quantity we are far more strategically positioned to deliver on the needs of the new government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he argues that it is convenient rhetoric on the part of civil society to keep NGOs under pressure, preventing them from being seen as professional, competent entities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The image of NGOs staffed by excited young graduates, should be challenged.  Many NGOs like Immsa, Cals, LAPC, and Idasa are large, viable organisations, staffed by committed professionals who have chosen to stay out of the government. And it is their commitment that is abused, as many people expect NGOs to work for free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The critical issue, however, for most NGOs is funding. Case produced a book called Tango in the Dark to highlight some of the complicated scenarios that emerged in funding structures of different departments and the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naidoo is explicit about the failure of the government, in the first instance, to develop a clear policy as to whom international aid agencies should be funding, and then, after taking a large percentage of the pot, failing to spend it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a tragic error and resulted in many NGOs going to the wall. Of course international agencies have so much more interest in funding government. Regardless of the government's policy to encourage foreign donors to work directly with NGOs, it is not happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Self-sustainability is possible for some NGOs such as Case, which have always charged for their work, albeit at preferential rates for certain clients, through core funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, says Everatt: &quot;Viability depends on what the NGO does. You cannot charge impoverished communities, you have to be funded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This makes the development of the NDA even more important, as it will co- ordinate central government disbursement of funds to NGOs. Case nevertheless broke even last year - simply by beginning to charge what it really costs to do the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everatt argues that NGOs and community-based organisations (CBOs) need to focus and regroup themselves around specialised areas of activity. In other words, rationalise, to avoid duplication and to leverage influence as a sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coalition's bottom line is that NGOs cannot leave it up to the government but must start to call the shots. If they mobilise as a sector, they can begin to make an impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, Naidoo is proposing a two-track tendering system, which will give preference to voluntary organisations first, so that resources really go back into the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a point also made by Everatt, especially in terms of parastatals that continue to get large tax grants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naidoo concludes: &quot;NGOs are in the market place. Just because they are not profit- oriented does not mean they are not players. We leverage massive social capital, in terms of the work we do, and we have substantial consumer power as a collective. If you just think of the accumulated value of the pension funds of 2 000 NGOs, valued at R500- million, you can see the point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coalition wants to draw on the precedent of the trade unions and is exploring setting up a national investment fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly the NGO sector wants to move the tango on to the fast lane and into broad daylight; NGO Week may have been just the right catalyst.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South African financial institutions are honing their investment skills in preparation for the lifting of the remaining exchange controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More and more are taking advantage of the provision allowing them to invest 10% of their assets offshore by launching innovative funds that enable investors to gain exposure to foreign assets via their normal insurance policies or unit-trust investments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although asset swaps do not represent an ideal mechanism through which South Africans can diversify their savings internationally, they are nonetheless playing a role in enabling some diversification of investments,&quot; says Old Mutual chair Mike Levett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New products included the Old Mutual's Worldwide Equity and Worldwide Balanced funds, which had, for the first time in 30 years, given South African investors the opportunity to gain exposure to foreign investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the area of employee benefits, the new International Asset Portfolio has been launched. This is a unitised portfolio consisting of stocks from the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index and by June this year it had a portfolio of R355- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Old Mutual had also launched a Global Equity Fund, which has taken &quot;line honours among international unit trusts, providing a 33,4% return for the year ended June 30 1996&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Old Mutual was not only concentrating on markets abroad, Levett said.  It was firmly established in Namibia, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Malawi as well and was considering &quot;selective expansion into other markets&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Government moves are giving impetus to changes in rural financing, reports Madeleine Wackernagel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE transformation of the Land and Agricultural Bank gained momentum this week with the announcement by the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Affairs, Derek Hanekom, that it would in future fall under its jurisdiction, rather than that of the Ministry of Finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move is in line with recommendations made by the Strauss Commission, tabled in September, which also envisaged a new board in place by the beginning of this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, says Dr Helena Dolny, adviser to Hanekom, transformation of the Land Bank was not, understandably, a priority for the finance ministry. Now that the anomaly has been sorted out, the will is there to enforce significant changes at the bank.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanekom has accordingly extended the deadline for appointing a new board until the end of March next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolny points to the experience of the Development Bank of Southern Africa as a good example of how to enforce transformation. &quot;Until the new chief executive, Dr Ian Goldin, took charge, little real change took place at the bank. It may not be as important to replace the entire management, but change has to come from the top.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Land Bank has already shifted its emphasis to include emerging farmers while maintaining its existing operations to fund commercial farmers. But there is no question of subsidies, says the bank's Karl Ehrenberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless the government steps in to provide a grant to get a certain sector off the ground, we will carry on lending money in the usual way, providing wholesale financing through intermediaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do, however, recognise the need to reach people on the ground, so we have some challenges ahead to come up with innovative solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the Strauss Commission's recommendations was risk-sharing. We have already relaxed certain loan criteria but we need to do more to help the emerging farmers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolny believes a risk guarantee scheme, whereby the government would stand surety for a certain amount of debt if a borrower defaulted, would help to speed up the process of reaching deep into the rural areas. Overseas experience indicates this is the most efficient route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the bank should encourage stronger ties with non-governmental organisations, traditionally well- represented in the poorest sectors of the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is no question that the bank has an important role to play, says Dolny. It has an extensive network of branches, albeit concentrated in the traditionally white farming areas, and makes a profit on its lending. &quot; Agricultural co-operatives would no doubt jump at the opportunity to buy the bank if it were put up for sale, but it's doing its job properly, so why give it away to the private sector?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has until April Fool's Day to prove her right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the provinces gear up to grant much- sought-after casino licences, Safren is hoping that it will not be left out on a limb with its massive investments in casinos in the former homelands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman Buddy Hawton admitted to shareholders at the group's annual general meeting this week that uncertainty about the future of casino licences was one of the major issues facing the group this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safren's Sun International owns casinos such as Marula Sun, Sun City, Wild Coast Sun and the Carousel and will have to stand in line with other aspirant casino operators as and when the nine provinces start dishing out the 40 gambling licences that will be granted countrywide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hawton said that his group, through subsidiary Sun International, had provided in-depth information to provincial and national governments about the pros and cons of allowing its existing operations to continue running, possibly in partnership with black empowerment groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is certainly where a great deal of uncertainty hangs around in our business,&quot; Hawton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most provinces were still deciding how to apply the new legislation on gambling and whether they would tax gambling profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have perhaps been the forerunner in working with central and provincial governments in trying to get some rational and sensible application of the legislation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was clear that Safren would not be able to hold on to all its operations. Hawton said Safren wanted to apply for one or two licences in the Western Cape, preferably on the Peninsula, and one outside Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will have to look at the Gauteng market very carefully. We are in negotiations with central government and we are having discussions with the Gauteng legislature in regard to the way that these licences could or should be allocated that would endeavour to minimise the impact on existing infrastructure. It isn't an easy problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the allocation of licences was being co-ordinated by Minister of Trade and Industry Alec Erwin, who is expected to have another meeting with provincial MECs in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hawton said he hoped the information that had been provided &quot;will be recognised by the respective authorities. The problem that we have is that we have no guarantee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He predicted that another potentially contentious issue could be whether or not the former homeland development corporations should retain their investments in existing casinos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to legislation passed earlier this year, they have to sell their stakes in the casinos but Hawton said that several provinces, mainly the North-West and the Eastern Cape, believed &quot;there is no good reason why they would have to divest their interests ... I am not sure we have seen the last of that, despite the fact that the legislation has been enacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are very uneasy that they have got to dispose of their shares when there is an overhang in the market which is depressing the price of their shareholding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hawton said that partly because of the uncertainty in the casino market, Safren was concentrating on its overseas investments and operations in order to offset possible losses. These included hotels, casinos, cinema chains and shipping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the &quot;global side of the business will continue to play quite a significant part in our expansion programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not that we are forgetting South Africa. It is just that in some of our businesses we are fairly substantial and therefore the opportunities become more limited.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Minister of Public Enterprises is seeking direct control over Eskom's equity, raising concerns of a backdoor attempt at nationalisation. Max Gebhardt reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Ministry of Public Enterprises has set the ball in motion to bring Eskom under direct government control, despite admitting that such a move could raise doubts among foreign investors over the government's commitment to privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents leaked to the Mail &amp; Guardian reveal that Minister of Public Enterprises Stella Sigcau plans to amend the Eskom Act early next year to allow her ministry to gain direct control of Eskom's equity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a memorandum prepared by the ministry for Cabinet, Sigcau, together with the ministries of Finance and Mineral and Energy Affairs, seeks to amend the Eskom Act in the second quarter of the 1997 parliamentary session to finalise the ownership issue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She maintains that the ownership of the equity rests with the government, which is entitled to receive payments from Eskom out of the accumulated reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the minister's memorandum, the ministries of Public Enterprises and Finance are in agreement with &quot;the minister's (Sigcau) policy to convert Eskom into a limited liability company and (to remove) the tax exemption&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ownership of net equity, payment of dividends and taxation will be dealt with simultaneously through the incorporation of Eskom into a limited liability company, the memorandum states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskom does not have share capital and as a result equity consists of accumulated reserves through retained earnings from the sale of electricity.  At the 1995 financial year-end, Eskom's accumulated reserves stood at R18- billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present Eskom Act, according to Sigcau, is not clear as to what the state is entitled to in respect of this equity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's necessary (to change the Act) because as things stand at the moment, Eskom is not vested within the government. Therefore legislation is necessary to place the entity under government control and this should happen early next year,&quot; Sigcau told the M&amp;G.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskom's equity, she said, will not go into government coffers; instead it will be left to act as a cover for Eskom's international debt. According to Eskom's annual report, its net interest-bearing debt stood at R27- billion at the 1995 financial year-end, of which R5,6-billion is foreign debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no backtracking on privatisation; this is part of the commercialisation of Eskom to make it more competitive,&quot; says Sigcau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister said this was not a move by government to nationalise Eskom, therefore foreign investors have nothing to fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can guarantee that in writing if necessary,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, her memorandum acknowledges that although there is nothing technically wrong with the plans to amend the Act, there are certain problems associated with such an approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By emphasising ownership and taxation, the government could send the wrong signals about its transformation objectives for Eskom. This could be misunderstood by Eskom's foreign lenders as a move towards nationalisation, which could potentially bring certain foreign loans into jeopardy,&quot; the memorandum says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This view is echoed in a letter to the minister from Eskom chairman Dr John Maree. He says that although the Eskom Act is silent on the issue of ownership of Eskom's net equity, it could be argued that the state would be able to lay claim to its equity under the principle of &quot;owner of last resort&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Maree warns, any legislation to make this claim more transparent will in reality be viewed as nationalisation and would in all probability solicit negative responses not only from large consumers and stockholders in South Africa, but also from the international investor community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Investors could probably call in their loans if Eskom's present position is fundamentally changed,&quot; Maree writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sigcau is also seeking to bring Eskom's tax status into line with that of other state enterprises. The electricity generator is presently exempted from paying companies tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This amendment will be addressed by incorporating Eskom into a limited liability company in terms of the Companies Act, according to the minister's memorandum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sigcau says this is being done purely to introduce a proper system of corporate governance at Eskom. She says no decision has yet been taken as to what the dividends received will be used for - though in all likelihood funds will be channelled back into the industry and not the fiscus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskom, she adds, would pay tax like any other company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to the confusion surrounding the interpretation of any amendments to the Eskom Act, a senior government insider says this move by the minister could be seen as the forerunner to selling off sections of Eskom next year to boost foreign confidence in the privatisation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a representative for the ministry said any talk about the privatisation of Eskom was premature at this stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prevailing sentiment, however, is one of concern at the direction the minister is taking. One industry insider who has been privy to the process believes there are serious worries at the difficulty the government will have in convincing overseas investors that this is not an attempt at nationalisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Eskom management is also concerned that by being forced to pay tax and dividends it could hamper its electrification projects and any added costs would have to be passed on to consumers in the form of higher tariffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eskom doesn't want any of these changes; it is willing to go forward but only within specifically laid-down rules,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskom had not responded to M&amp;G's questions at the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been requested by the ANC, a tried and tested movement to make myself available as a candidate for the Premiership of the Free State Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thank the ANC for the singular honour and trust they have bestowed upon me and declare, with humility, that I accept this candidature.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, for me is the beginning of a long and arduous road into formal politics, but a road I am willing to travel under the banner of an organisation that led our people to liberation from apartheid. An organisation that has taken responsibility for reconciling South Africa, building unity in diversity, an organisation that has overcome great odds to see its vision and mission accomplished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This organisation has been blessed with leadership that has given selflessly of itself and with humility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Die' is 'n organisasie wie se ouere leierskap se nederigheid, ons geleer het dat ons al ons mense moet bedien met respek en met eerlikheid. Dat ons al ons mense wit en swart, jonk of oud, ryk of arm, man of vrou, geskik of ongeskik, behoeftig of nie, geleerd, op gelyke wyse hanteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the organisation that through commitment to the interests of the majority of our people, negotiated skilfully and was bold enough to make the necessary compromises to deliver a ratified Constitution for South Africa that safeguards every one's interest especially that of the disadvantage majority.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I come here at the time when the process of reconciliation, construction and revitalization of the organisation is well under way. I have no doubt the building of a strong united cohesive ANC will benefit the Governance of this Province and that with the cooperation of the alliance structures, the reconstruction and development programme will become reality expecially the central principles of the RDP to fight poverty, developing the Communities and our entire human resources, building interracial harmony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I express my appreciation for the excellent work Cde Terror Lekota and his team have done in developing this Province and in making great strides in reconciling the people of this Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have received message of unqualified support from many people within and outside of the Province including from among the former leaders of the Provincial Executive Committee. I like to thank them for the messages and their support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the process, a series of meetings will be held with the ANC structures, including the caucus, alliance partners, SANCO, the Churches and other religious bodies, business community, academics, farmers and farm workers, women and youth organisations the idea being that we march in step together in the development of this Province.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Interest in South Africa as a testing ground for genetically modified organisms is increasing. This interest is shown mainly by multinationals such as Calgene, Pannar, Monsanto and Hoescht.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But South Africa has no regulations to control modern biotechnology - the craft of creating artificial organisms - despite the threat it could pose to human health and the environment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voluntary guidelines are administered by the South African Committee for Genetic Experimentation, a government advisory body, and a Bill to establish a regulatory system is making its way through Parliament. But there is a prevailing perception that the Bill is lopsided and cumbersome, and does not adequately address the country's inability to manage potential risks to the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local biotechnology industry is about three decades old, but the issue of regulating it has only recently entered the public domain. In October, the Department of Tourism and Environmental Affairs released the Green Paper on Biodiversity, which pointed out the potential threats of this modern science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What separates biotechnology from other scientifcic endeavours is that it can fundamentally transform living organisms. These can interact with other organisams, changing them and sometimes causing them to become extinct. The threat is similar to that of invasive alien plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is not a signatory to the International Convention of Biodiversity, which aims to protect the world's biological resources. The countries that have signed agree that an international protocol on biosafety is needed to ensure the safe handling and transfer of genetically modified organisms between countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This move is regarded as a victory for developing countries, which fear that they could become the dumping grounds of genetic experimentation by the developed countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Tourism and Environmental Affairs held a workshop in October to discuss the South African position on the proposed international protocol. But there is still a general reluctance within the local industry to engage in this debate, and to large extent the industry is opposed to an international protocol.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Ma Dladla doesn't complain much about the absence of refuse removal or the long queues to get water from one of the five standpipes in her shanty town. She prioritises a different concern: paraffin is expensive and getting more so. She lives in a shack settlement with high levels of unemployment, no access to electricity and limited access to other fuels.  Residents rely on paraffin for most of their energy needs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No less than one litre&quot; of the fuel is bought daily by Ma Dladla. She needs it to cook, iron and heat her home. In September 1995, when paraffin cost R1,30 a litre at her local spaza, her monthly expenditure of at least R40 on the fuel already represented 13% of the household's monthly R300 income. A year later paraffin expenditure, up to around R54 a month, now represents 18% of the household's income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, paraffin is essentially the fuel of the poor. Yet over the past year, the price of paraffin has outstripped inflation, increasing by 30%.  The country's poorest are shouldering the largest price rise of any essential consumption item.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paraffin wholesale pricing structures are complex. They fluctuate monthly according to an aggregate of international and local determinants: along with other liquid fuels (including petrol and diesel) the base price is set as the &quot;In Bond Loaded Cost&quot; (IBLC) - a price set by four large international export refineries. Since this is tallied in dollars, its fluctuations are to some extent dependent on the rand-dollar exchange rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, on to this base price a number of &quot;adjustments&quot; - government levies and so on - are calculated and added by the government's Central Energy Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxes from a number of government departments are imposed. These are not constant and change in response to pressures from different interest groups, and according to Cabinet decisions. The Equalisation Fund Levy was also added to the IBLC price in order to subsidise Mossgas and Sasol's sanctions busting and expensive synthetic fuels. A &quot;zone differential&quot; is also added to wholesale prices, accounting for transport costs for the fuel from the coastal cities to inland areas. Wholesale prices thus vary around South Africa, and are lower at the coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The non-transparency of the pricing mechanism makes it difficult to identify where constructive interventions can be implemented to control price increases. In addition to the levies and taxes included in the wholesale price, paraffin is also subject to Value Added Tax (VAT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several questions need to be answered by the government. Why is that the poor are contributing to subsidising activities unrelated to their own needs?

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Despite the media attacks, the IBAis doing a good job, argues Willie Currie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) has been closed. Not by Parliament, but by the press. This prediction, which coincides with nominations for the South African Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (Satra) Council, is premature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA is alive and not about to disappear. Despite staff allegations of mismanagement and financial irregularities as well as a Supreme Court case concerning its judgment on the licensing of Radio Jacaranda, the IBA has an important role to play in regulating an increasingly competitive broadcasting sector, thereby building a real radio and television industry in South Africa.  This is what the press coverage of the IBA as a carriage on the ubiquitous gravy train misses entirely.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The press has forgotten why we need an IBA. Broadcasting is subject to political manipulation. If we have forgotten this lesson, perhaps the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) should place the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) in the dock and remind us how the apartheid state's control of the airwaves attempted to hide and mislead people about the horrors of apartheid. A democratic state requires a diversity of voices to be heard so that citizens can make informed decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apartheid state retained a statutory monopoly over broadcasting. Only privileged groups with special connections to apartheid politicians could get access to the airwaves (as was the case with M-Net, Radio 702 and Capital Radio). The demand for diversity of voices in a democracy needs to be translated into a diversity of radio and TV stations. This means opening the airwaves to a range of broadcasters who compete for audiences and advertisers.  Competing broadcasters create the possibility of building a broadcasting industry that can contribute not only to informing, educating and entertaining citizens but also, through advertising, to the circulation of goods and services which, in turn, helps to build the economy. In addition, a competitive broadcasting market creates the conditions for quality South African programming which can then be sold on international TV markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A diverse and competitive broadcasting market can create the conditions in which radio and TV contribute to our collective sense of ourselves as South Africans. The extent to which radio and TV hold up a mirror and reflect our society is something of a cliche. But the importance of this aspect of broadcasting cannot be under- estimated. In the United States (US), despite its diverse range of racial, gender and class identities, all citizens recognise themselves as Americans. Ninety-five percent of all programming on US radio and TV stations is US in origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do these political, economic and cultural reasons have to do with the IBA? Simply, that you don't create the conditions for a diverse, competitive broadcasting by doing nothing. You need someone to lay down fair and impartial rules and regulations as to how broadcasters get access to the airwaves, the basis of fair competition between them and appropriate local TV and music content regulations that will make sure our musicians and TV producers can compete with the deluge of US music and television that swamp South African audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How well has the IBA shaped up? On the task of moving us away from the uniformity of His Apartheid Master's Voice, the IBA in its triple inquiry into public broadcasting, cross-media ownership and local content, helped redefine the SABC's mandate as a public broadcaster rather than a state broadcaster, and moved the SABC away from statutory monopoly by selling six of its commercial regional radio stations. This marked the beginning of the country's privatisation programme and was undoubtedly a welcome sign to investors as well as preparing the SABC for competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of creating a diversity of voices, the IBA has licensed more than 80 community radio stations countrywide - the latest licence going to the Rural Women's Movement to open a radio station in Moutse. This dramatic democratisation of our airwaves is one of the IBA's greatest feats and one that is most ignored by the press. Community radio stations provide local communities with a voice and enable citizens to exchange views and ideas at grassroots level. The scale of this expansion and empowerment of local community broadcasters has never been achieved elsewhere in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of its goal of building competitive broadcasting, the IBA is in the process of licensing eight new private radio stations and a new private national free-to-air television station. The emergence of these stations will not only provide citizens with a greater choice of programmes, but also bring the discipline of regulated competition to bear upon the SABC. More than anything else, the competition will force the SABC to transform itself into the kind of public broadcaster capable of fulfilling its public service mandate on a level playing field with the private broadcasting sector. The IBA will achieve this by setting fair and equitable regulations for both private and public broadcasters - with regard to language, provincial coverage, local content and the quality and range of programming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA also has the task of promoting the ownership and control of radio and TV stations by members of disadvantaged groups. It is doubtful whether the advantaged owners of Primedia would have entered into partnership with trade union and women's groups in their successful bid for Radio Highveld, if this had not been a requirement of the IBA. The value of this sea-change in the ownership and control of broadcasting should also not be under-estimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To achieve these goals, we need a broadcasting regulator. Why do we need an independent broadcasting regulator? The IBA has the delicate task of choosing between different groups that want licences to broadcast. The frequency spectrum is a scarce resource. Not everyone can have access to it. One needs a visibly fair and impartial group to decide openly and in the public interest which of the competing groups should be licensed. In a democracy, it is not right to make decisions on the basis of patronage or reward. All citizens are meant to be equal. Hence it is not appropriate for government to award scarce licences, as there will always be the suspicion that government is rewarding someone for loyalty or service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, it is not appropriate for members of the broadcasting industry to issue licences as they will not be willing to license their competitors.  Hence, modern democracies have introduced independent regulators who are tasked to make these difficult decisions in the public interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has the IBA successfully made these difficult licensing decisions, fairly and impartially? It is fair to say that in over 100 public licence hearings conducted by the IBA, it has only been challenged on one occasion - that of Radio Jacaranda. That is a pretty good track record for a new institution in a new democracy which has never had any history of independent regulation before. The Federal Communications Commission in the US, on the other hand, spends much of its time in court and on Capitol Hill explaining decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The press may rail about the gravy train and financial irregularity in the IBA but there is barely a public institution or structure of state that is not faced with the spectre of corruption, financial irregularity and the gravy train. Very few commentators are calling for the closure of the Department of Health, Transnet, the SABC or any other institution bedevilled by mismanagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our entire society is on a steep learning curve trying to build a new democracy and we must take steps to tighten financial controls, discipline offenders and strengthen our institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allegations of financial mismanagement at the IBA must be addressed by the Public Protector. But the concept of independent regulation and the opening of the airwaves should not be punished. One would be surprised if the Public Protector took a view on the independent regulation of broadcasting. He is more likely to make recommendations on financial controls and fiscal management. As far as the press's prediction that the IBA will be swallowed up by the Telecommunications Regulator, Satra, goes, it is important to point out that Satra is going to have its hands full re- regulating Telkom and opening the telecom sector up to competition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An opportunity to show high-level commitment to Aids has been missed, say Mary Crew and James McIntyre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO rumours circulated in the week preceding World Aids Day. The first was that President Mandela and Deputy President Mbeki would be joining Minister Zuma at the National Health World Aids Day rally in Bloemfontein. It was believed that, for the first time, the government would be showing a high- level commitment and solidarity to the HIV and Aids campaign. It was hoped that their presence would show that HIV and Aids really is the priority which the government claims it to be. For people with HIV and Aids it was seen as public support and the creation of a climate of support and non- discrimination.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the second rumour surfaced, that they had cancelled attending the rally, preferring to attend other functions. This unleashed an outburst of rage from NGOs, CBOs, from Aids programmes and particularly from people with HIV and Aids, who felt betrayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it turned out, both rumours were false - but their effects are not. It seems incredible that post-Sarafina and all its damage, neither saw the need to attend. It also seems incredible that post-Sarafina, the build up to this rally, and the media coverage of it, were so desultory and poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was clear throughout the media reports was that most people with HIV and Aids do not wish to be identified. This is a harsh indictment on society and on the government's lack of action. But their fear of identification should make the director general of health, Dr Olive Shisana, take another look at the statements she made to the SAMI concerning confidentiality, as well as the comparisons she made between HIV and Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shisana implied that it is the commitment to confidentiality that is causing HIV to spread, and that were we simply to reveal the status of people with HIV, then we would be both halting the epidemic and &quot;normalising&quot; the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The considerable consultation countrywide which preceded the Nacosa National Aids strategy, in which Dr Zuma was key participant, is reflected in the emphasis in this plan on the rights of people with HIV. The reasons why HIV and Aids workers are so determined to protect confidentiality are simple.  It respects privacy, and it protects people from the social and political stigma, prejudice and discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is cynical to claim, as Shisana has done, that confidentiality is a &quot; superficial constraint&quot; or a &quot;waste of time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People with HIV and Aids would be delighted if confidentiality ceased to be an issue and they were treated like anybody else with a life-threatening illness. This will only happen when people are respected rather than punished when they reveal their status. Placing the blame for the spread of virus on confidentiality returns us to the position where people with HIV and Aids are again blamed, rather than looking at ways in which they and the wider society together can halt the epidemic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - China, recognised last week by President Mandela, has one of the world's worst human rights records, says Guy Liberman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela's controversial choice of the People's Republic of China over Taiwan may appear to be economically motivated - a triumph of realpolitik - but he has given his support to a regime akin to the apartheid government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mainland China's human rights record is one of the most appalling in the world. Despite being chastised by many world leaders, the Chinese authorities continue to suppress and torture dissidents who oppose their ideological dominance. And, perhaps most terribly, have waged genocidal destruction on the Tibetan nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the culturally-richest races on earth is facing annihilation by their larger, aggressive neighbours over the oil-rich reserves that lie under Tibetan soil. Mandela was silent on these issues. When the Dalai Lama visited South Africa in August, the support for the Tibetan cause clearly held promise and a feeling of solidarity was undoubtably present. It wasn't when Mandela announced plans to recognise Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China's enforced presence in Tibet since 1949 has been mostly hidden from the world. International news teams are not allowed entry into that territory.  The only information is from Tibetan escapees and from tourists who have witnessed atrocities performed by Chinese soldiers on Tibetans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The destructive nature of Chinese activities spans Tibetan life: the immeasurable violations performed on women, including forced abortions and sterilisation; the rape of the forests - bringing in billions of US dollars for China, while ensuring irreparable damage to these fragile ecosystems. It also affects the source of all Asia's major rivers, which feed half the world's population. The damming of Tibet's sacred lakes for hydro-electric power plants is causing untold damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The destruction of 6000 monasteries over a short period of time has shown the contempt the Chinese have for the Tibetans. Dumping of nuclear waste is rife.The Chinese term for Tibet means storehouse, indicative of their attitude towards the Tibetans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least one in seven Tibetans have served an extended prison sentence, accused of political dissent. Since China's occupation in 1959, (when the Dalai Lama and 80000 Tibetans escaped into exile in India, after an abortive Tibetan uprising in the capital, Lhasa) over 1,2-million Tibetans have died through torture, starvation, execution or suicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Free Tibet Campaign, UK, and approved by Asia Watch, there are some 6000 documented laogais across mainland China and Tibet. They hold an estimated 20- million prisoners. Laogai, or &quot;reform through labour&quot;, is a central feature of the Chinese prison system. People are detained because of their peaceful resistance to the Chinese occupation, are denied their freedom, and subjected to &quot;thought reform&quot;. Brutality is widespread inside the laogai, especially in Tibet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although equivalent to Nazi concentration camps or Russian gulags, they differ by their use of &quot;thought reform&quot;. Inmates in the laogai are forced to perform hard labour to atone for their crimes and required to abandon their &quot; incorrect&quot; beliefs and attitudes and conform to the standards set by the Chinese Communist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prisoners' forced labour supplies China with a large proportion of its exportable goods. International communities buying into this are helping to feed this violation of human rights. If South Africa is so uninformed as to China's activities, perhaps more research should have been done before we chose to forge diplomatic ties with mainland China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent intervention by the Chinese into Tibetan religious practises demonstrates the nature of this regime. The Dalai Lama's choice of six-year-old Gendun Choekyi Nyima as the candidate for the high- ranking religious position of Panchen Lama has been nullified by the Chinese. The child, his family and entire entourage were abducted last year. Their whereabouts remain unknown. The Chinese presented another youngster in his place; interfering in an age-old religious practice. Many fear the young Panchen Lama dead. He is the world's youngest political prisoner and inspired a worldwide campaign for his immediate, unconditional release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng has served a 15-year prison sentence for speaking out on the democratisation of China and the freedom of Tibet. In 1993, at the culmination of his term, the Chinese government issued him another 15-year sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September of 1987, the Dalai Lama issued the United Nations with his proposed Five- Point Peace Plan for negotiations with Mainland China. They include: transformation of the whole of Tibet into a zone of peace; abandonment of China's population transfer policy which threatens the very existence of the Tibetans as a people; respect for the Tibetan people's fundamental human rights and democratic freedom; restoration and protection of Tibet's natural environment and the abandonment of China's use of Tibet for the production of nuclear weapons and dumping of nuclear waste; commencement of earnest negotiations on the future status of Tibet and of relations between the Tibetans and Chinese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese have refused negotiations with the Dalai Lama or the Tibetan government but agree to negotiations between the two nations with the precondition that the Dalai Lama admits that Tibet is, and always has been, an inseparable part of China. The Dalai Lama responded by saying that as a Buddhist, he cannot lie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although China's approach to control and oppression may change, it is unlikely. The Dalai Lama has said change is inevitable, and the present Chinese government will dissolve. But this is not likely to be in the near future. There is, though, a strong presence of the democracy movement among a large proportion of Chinese youth that may grow. From this angle, diplomatic ties are a good move. The question is then the motivation behind President Mandela's actions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Realpolitik forced South Africa's recognition of mainland China and its decision to cut off official ties with Taiwan. Those who suggested the decision reflected the influence of the South African Communist Party on the government were missing the point.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No serious international player can continue without ties to a country of China's size and growth levels - and it was only a matter of time before our government accepted this reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was heartening to see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after so much prevarication, make a firm and unequivocal policy decision. And the outcome does signal that a contribution to the African National Congress's 1994 election coffers on the scale of Taiwan's will only buy the government's favour for a limited time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But President Nelson Mandela and Minister of Foreign Affairs Alfred Nzo did leave us with the impression that foreign policy is made and changed in a rather confused and hurried way. Only a few months ago, Mandela was reassuring the Taiwanese that it would be &quot;immoral&quot; to ditch them; and he was embracing the Dalai Lama, and listening to his concerns about the treatment of his people under Chinese rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week's change of direction was abrupt and unexpected, with little build-up and little diplomatic preparation. This seems a strange way to manage major shifts in policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it would have been reassuring to hear Mandela raise the international community's concerns with human rights in China. We would at least like to know that South Africa will use its relationship with China to encourage better treatment of dissidents, Tibetans and other victims of Beijing policy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Fry, Namibia's deputy permanent secretary of water affairs, said this week that the severity of Namibia's water crisis left it with &quot;little option&quot; but to investigate drawing water from the Okavango.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current desperation has raised fears that Namibia will rush through its feasibility study on the Okavango pipeline without taking into account the full impact of the scheme on Botswana's unique Okavango Delta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibian and Botswana governments recently agreed that the environmental impact study should be extended to cover concerns about the delta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fry maintained that while the technical part of the feasibility study will be completed in January 1997, the environmental study will continue until March, giving enough time to study the river in dry and wet conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results of the feasibility study are then expected to be put to Botswana for approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fry was reluctant to say what might happen if the Botswana government rejected the outcome of the study, but added that no international donor would fund the project if Botswana was adamantly opposed to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pipeline, expected to cost in the region of R1-billion, is believed to have caught the interest of a number of international donors, including the German and Japanese governments and the European Investment Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fry argues that his department is doing everything in its power to look at schemes that would make the Okavango plan unnecessary, but stressed: &quot;We have very few alternatives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia is about to start pumping water from a disused mine near the northern town of Grootfontein, which is expected to see Windhoek through for a further 12 months, even if there is no rain and the dams run dry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that the scenario becomes less clear. Using water from disused mines is seen as only fending off the inevitable, and increasingly Namibia's water planners are seeing the Okavango as the only option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek's residents have been cutting back water use, recently achieving a 30% saving. The city's annual consumption of 17-million cubic metres has not increased significantly since independence six years ago, despite the population growth from 130 000 to 220 000 in that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia's argument that the use of Okavango water will be negligible is not widely accepted in Botswana where recent newspaper headlines have proclaimed &quot; Hands off the delta&quot; and &quot;Green activists might take up arms&quot;. But prophecies of a &quot;water war&quot; between the two countries are being seen here as hyperbole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fry believes Botswana will see Namibia's water crisis in the light of &quot; humanitarian need&quot; and will ultimately respond to the pipeline project sympathetically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also dismissed last week's Mail &amp; Guardian report that Namibia was already negotiating with United States company, Owens Corning, to construct the 250km-long pipe, saying that the technical specifications would not be known until next year and that the project's donors would insist on an international tender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it does rain significantly next year, Fry said the pipeline would still be investigated through the Okavango River Basin Commission but without the same sense of urgency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Evidence has emerged from election results released by the government-constituted Zambian Electoral Commission that the outcome of the polls on November 18 may well have been fixed before the polling day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are several instances of strange and inexplicable uniformity in election results in many constituencies. In some constituencies, the number of people who voted was more than the number of registered voters, giving credence to the opposition's claims that &quot;ghost voters&quot; had been used by the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) to manipulate the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Chipata and Luangeni constituencies, both in the Eastern Province, President Frederick Chiluba and all his rivals - Dean Mungomba of the Zambia Democratic Congress, Humphrey Mulemba of the National Party, Aka Lewanika of Agenda for Zambia and Chama Chakomboka of the Movement for Democratic Process got exactly the same number of votes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba won 7 720 votes in both constituencies. Mungomba got 2 169, Mulemba won 386, Lewanika 365 and Chakomboka 214.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mwinilunga constituency in the North- Western Province, Chiluba won 5 647, and in Mpika constituency in the Northern Province, he got 5 649 - a difference of only two votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the constituency of Chipangali, Eastern Province, Chiluba gained 3 323 votes, compared to 3 322 in Serenje in the Central Province - a discrepancy of just one vote. In Dundumwzi in the Southern Province, he got a suspiciously similar 3 326.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Magoye in the Southern Province, Chiluba received 6 065 votes, compared to 6 066 in Mababala in the Central Province, while in Malole and Lukashya, Chiluba got 8 953, and 8 950 respectively - just three votes difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials from several local election monitoring groups, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of victimisation, said ghost voters may have boosted Chiluba's vote count by as much as 300 000 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alfred Zulu, chairman of the Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT), who is already facing trial on as yet unspecified charges, nevertheless ventured to say: &quot;This is not normal. It shows that there has been some manipulation going on. This pattern of vote counts tallying in two or three constituencies is unusual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngande Mwanajiti, executive chairman of the Zambian branch of Afronet, an international human rights organisation, said: &quot;These revelations give credence to what we have been saying all along. All things will have to be examined to determine who has been lying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwanajiti, who is also chairman for the National Committee for Clean Campaign (NCCC), is also facing trial on unspecified charges. Both he and Zulu are out on bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lucy Sichone, executive director of the Zambia Civic Education Association, said the outcome painted in bolder relief the MMD's draconian reaction to those who have rubbished the election as fraudulent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sichone said Chiluba's government was working at crushing dissenters to &quot; escape the consequences of their actions. But it will not work. The MMD is an illegal government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Simon Mwewa, the elections chairman in the opposition United National Independent Party (Unip), said his party had known about the election results as far back as January this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwewa said the MMD had planned to &quot;rig the elections in such a way that they would end up with at least 100 seats, Unip with 40 seats and other opposition parties scrambling for less than five seats. We foresaw all this, that's why we pulled out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not want to disclose where he had received the information, for fear of reprisals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MMD has ended up with 120 seats, out of a total 150. The opposition - excluding Unip which pulled out of the running in early October - has ended up with 20 seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Justice Bobby Bwalya, the chairman of the Zambian Electoral Commission, outrightly dismissed any possibility of rigging, in the face of the suspect figures uncovered by his own organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week he became hysterical when independent journalists tried to interview Joel Sikazwe, election press liaison officer for the commission.  He angrily threatened to beat anyone who tried to gain entry into his office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Bwalya was agreeable to talking to state-media journalists. He told them: &quot;There were no ghost voters anywhere. Those stories are pure imagination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election office is now being guarded by heavily armed soldiers and paramilitary police, 24 hours a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early last week, Chiluba accused non- government organisations involved in election monitoring of receiving funds from the Swedish, United States, British and Japanese embassies for aiding their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He ordered searches of their offices, froze their bank accounts, and arrested several of their officials after they had declared the elections fraudulent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba this week again justified this clampdown, and his charging of Zulu and Sikazwe under Chapter 109, Section Four of a Zambian law which states: &quot; No organisation shall, except with the prior approval of the president in writing, accept assistance from any foreign government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But George Kunda, spokesperson for the Law Association of Zambia, said the law had been deliberately twisted. &quot;ZIMT and NCCC do not pursue political agendas of any sort,&quot; he said. &quot;This Act talks about organisations involved explicitly in politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba's newly appointed Cabinet has been labelled by independent commentators as tribalist. Twenty-two of the 25 Cabinet ministers are drawn from the Bemba-speaking Northern and Luapula provinces. Chiluba himself is a Bemba from Luapula Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts have said the Cabinet rejig is nothing more than a game of political chairs - the reconstituted Cabinet still includes the same people, for the most part - and that this won't do much to improve the country's declining economy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kigali - Zairean rebels say they have launched an assault against the main diamond-mining region, threatening a major source of the elite's wealth and potentially providing the insurgents with an important means of funding their war against ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko's regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan-backed insurgents are headed toward the regional capital, Mbuji- Mayi, where the giant South African De Beers corporation has considerable investments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, has sent a 27-page letter to Mobutu, who is convalescing from cancer in the south of France, asking him to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is impossible for Zaire to get itself out of the mess it is in, with no constitutional government, no independent judiciary, no constitution. The country's leader is reigning unconstitutionally, placing himself above the law and holding his people hostage,&quot; a summary of the letter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire is attacking on at least two fronts after seizing a 650km stretch of territory on Zaire's eastern borders. Beside targeting the mineral-rich Kasai region in the centre of the country, an alliance leader, Jean Kabongo, said his men are also pressing toward Kisangani, the largest city in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rebel seizure of Mbuji-Mayi and other diamond-mining areas might prove crippling to Mobutu's regime. Even through the decades of economic collapse in Zaire, the diamond industry remained a lucrative source of funds for Mobutu and his cronies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels have assured mining companies - including De Beers, which buys most of Zaire's diamonds - that they will be free to continue operating in &quot; liberated&quot; territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kabila said the mining firms will be expected to pay taxes to the rebel administration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Zimbabwe's record of ivory management has been described as &quot; grossly inadequate&quot; by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) just six months before the Geneva-based organisation is due to hold a major conference in Harare. The Zimbabwean government has said it will use the conference to have the Cites ban on the ivory trade overturned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a confidential report by a Cites panel of experts, illegal ivory exports from Zimbabwe have been allowed to proceed unchecked. The report, which follows a recent visit to the country by the panel, will come as a serious embarrassment for the government ahead of next June's Cites summit in Harare, where Zimbabwe will seek international support for its proposal to resume trade in elephant products, including ivory.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government claims that its exemplary record in elephant management warrants a selective lifting of the current Cites ban on exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's ivory stockpile is estimated at 30 tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Cites report says control over ivory carving in the country has broken down, allowing dealers to export commercial quantities to the Far East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cites documentation governing the movement of ivory which explicitly excludes commercial shipments has been used by dealers to export raw, worked and semi- worked ivory to a variety of countries including Japan, China, Thailand, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Indonesia, the United States and South Africa, the report reveals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, some of the consignments were massive, including a single shipment to Japan valued at US$919 113 (well over R4-million), which had been carved from 70 tusks weighing 663kg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report notes Zimbabwe's Customs Service has a general policy of not implementing trade controls on manufactured ivory products carried as personal possessions, nor does it regulate the transit of ivory into duty- free shops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that China-bound bales of tobacco containing hidden ivory were intercepted at the Beit Bridge border post shared by Zimbabwe and South Africa, although this incident receives only an oblique reference in the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Environment and Tourism minister Edward Chindori-Chininga said this week his ministry was aware of the allegations and those responsible for illicit dealings would &quot;face the full wrath of the law&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the report claims that the ministry only acted to withdraw the permits of those involved one week before the panel's arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The panel was not provided with any explanation why it has taken so long to take action given that evidence of these abuses had been available since April 1996, if not earlier,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers say there was a heated exchange between the Cites panel and staff from the National Parks' Investigations Branch who accused the panel of &quot; interference&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report warns of the risk of increased poaching as the cash-strapped Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management, systematically starved of funds by the government in recent years, reduced its resources in high- risk areas such as the Zambezi Valley in the north of the country and Gonarezhou in the south-east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Declining revenues posed a dilemma, the report warns. &quot;While the department is clearly in need of every source of additional revenue available, including the sale of ivory, its lack of management capability makes it unlikely that the money will be used effectively.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe has mounted a diplomatic offensive aimed at securing support from neighbouring countries for its campaign to downlist elephants from Appendix One of the Cites convention which forbids commercial trade to Appendix Two, which permits sustainable use and trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although South Africa's National Parks Board originally said it would oppose downlisting, it now appears to be bound by a decision of the Southern African Development Community to support Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - This week's guest writer Mandla Langa looks at one of the human tragedies behind taxi violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT 45, Charles Z Dlamini can cram myriad lifetimes into his own uncertain one. His bloodshot eyes have that long-distant, unsurprised look reminiscent of habitual survivors. Descended from a branch of the royal Swazi house and raised in Mpumalanga, he heeded his own father's advice that he leave Nelspruit and seek his fortune as a commoner in Johannesburg and Pretoria, for the simple reason that active membership of that exalted house was a poisoned chalice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His two uncles who remained in Nelspruit but still had pretensions to chieftaincy came to ignominious ends. A band of marauders descended on his uncles' homestead in KaNyamazane and murdered almost all the occupants, including Dlamini's nephews and the nightwatchmen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even today,&quot; he says, &quot;whenever I drive up to Nelspruit, I never break bread with my relatives.&quot; A cup of coffee, he reasons, could well be his last, so attuned is his sense of self-preservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This heightened instinct has stood him in good stead in the taxi wars, where he has developed this homegrown early-warning system. Dlamini has been driving taxis for as long as he can remember, starting a route from Pretoria Station to Pietersburg with his close childhood friend, Samson Mashigo. The two men poached passengers from the station, made deals with ticket examiners whereby they returned unused tickets - which were later resold - and divided the spoils. It was a good arrangement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trouble started in the mid-Eighties when the &quot;smart guys came in and started this talk about the association&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Big Six taxi association was formed in response to pressure on taxi drivers to form a unitary body to help regulate the industry. Soon Dlamini found himself frittering away valuable driving time &quot;sitting in kombis devising some strategy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people who were gung-ho about setting up the association were newcomers in the taxi business, but they were the most vocal. Dlamini and Mashigo had allowed them space in the rank, because they believed that the industry could grow and there were hundreds of customers who appreciated the service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the newcomers came up with restrictive measures, limiting the numbers of taxis which should be allowed in. &quot;Then they came, sometimes with six kombis,&quot; Dlamini observes without a hint of irony, &quot;and tried to edge us out, we who had opened our arms to them in the first instance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he doesn't spell it out clearly, I detect his discomfort with and mistrust of these educated Africans. Instead of pulling people out of the mire on to steady ground, their selfishness plunged a whole industry into chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newcomers clawed their way into leadership positions where they could dictate policy and exact levies. &quot;The joining fee,&quot; Dlamini asks, &quot;what does it do for the driver? Where does it go? When drivers die, we have to take up a collection for them - funeral expenses are not covered by the association.&quot; The money, he reasons, is used to buy guns and hire killers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The muscle-bound Lethlabile Taxi Association (LTA), formed in Alexandra Township, started making inroads into the Big Six turf. And then the pirates came in. Where the Big Six drivers had enjoyed a reciprocal relationship with local Pietersburg drivers who were allowed to transport fares from Pietersburg to Pretoria and back, a law was laid down that Pietersburg taxis should merely unload and return to base empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I knew, then, that trouble was brewing,&quot; Dlamini says. &quot;I mean, we could transport people to Pietersburg and return with a load, but the Pietersburg drivers couldn't do the same in our domain. Is that fair?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This question answered itself on the Easter weekend of 1987 when the first taxi was peppered with AK-47 bullets: the driver and two passengers were killed at the Warmbaths tollgate. Dlamini told Mashigo that it was high time they left the taxis. But Mashigo, who thought he could still remain a Big Six while maintaining some tenuous friendship with the LTA, dismissed Dlamini's concern as paranoia. While Dlamini withdrew, Mashigo continued with his route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 1989, violence had increased, with some of the taxi owners hiring hit- men from the hostels. There were killings and reprisals and counter-reprisals.  Drivers were fetched from their homes and executed. Mashigo was visited at his Mamelodi home by men who riddled his body with 16 bullets, the balancing act between the Big Six and LTA having stopped as surely as his heart had ceased to pump blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On another occasion, Dlamini was sitting conversing with a driver friend at the back of a taxi in Pretoria. Suddenly, the friend's eyes popped wide open and he dashed out of the vehicle. &quot;He ran,&quot; Dlamini remembers, &quot;and then stopped as if he had forgotten to engage his kombi into neutral and then he dropped, like a stone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A malignant outgrowth of the taxi killings is the proliferation of hit-men who double up as security. In 1994, a man named Nokala, Dlamini's one-time colleague in a meter taxi company, rode shotgun in taxis going to Beit Bridge.  He was always in a three-litre vehicle, a Cressida or Skyline. Such vehicles are known as &quot;squad cars&quot;. Nokala was shot dead in Hillbrow near the BP filling station on Kotze Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone venturing into Pietersburg in a three-litre vehicle is viewed with suspicion and hostility, and there is no guaranteeing that the vehicle won't be hijacked and the driver killed, mainly because people associate these vehicles with hit-squad activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dlamini puts the blame of the violence squarely on the shoulders of taxi associations. &quot;(Transport Minister Mac) Maharaj must ban all associations, field in more transportation inspectors and maintain a vigorous check on pirates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he speaks, I am reminded of the rats that are the first to escape before a vessel sinks. What, I ask, is the future of the meter taxi industry? Is there trouble there, too?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There'll be problems with meter taxis also.&quot; In fact, Dlamini says, it's better to open a spaza shop or get a hawker's licence. &quot;Nigerians, Malawians and Mozambicans are now running taxis. You try and park in front of the Mariston, Statesman or Whitbeck Apartments and a Nigerian driver who can't even speak Zulu, says to you 'My frien', whatchoo doin', my frien'? We pick up here.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three Sundays ago, Dlamini's younger brother, Moses, was greeted by a man three times. Moses asked the man why so many greetings and the man pulled out a gun. Moses, because he knew the gunman, warned him about playing with guns, whereupon, in full view of other drivers, the man shot Moses dead at point- blank range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weight of the statement, the memory of what he has endured, cause him to shrug his shoulders. Somewhere, hidden in the depths of his loss, is an admission of failure, as if he blames himself for not pulling rank on his brother. &quot;I'd always told him to get out of the taxi situation,&quot; Dlamini says, a series of emotions wrestling across his face, &quot;but he wouldn't listen. Now he's dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever happens, whether or not he opts for the informal sector, one thing is clear: Dlamini will neither return to Nelspruit nor wait for the incipient rumblings in the meter taxi industry to become an explosion. If he wasn't destined to rule, he was at least fated to survive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Provincial and Constitutional Affairs Minister Mohammed Valli Moosa tried to control the ANC's KwaZulu-Natal conference with an iron fist, but had to back down from plans to handpick a provincial secretary amid accusations that he was violating the party's constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates to the weekend conference in Durban said Valli Moosa delivered a National Executive Committee (NEC) &quot;directive&quot; in a no-nonsense fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The directive barred two senior incumbents, former secretary Senzo Mchunu and deputy secretary Sifiso Nkabinde, from contesting top posts in the party's provincial election.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While ANC leaders said Mchunu &quot;stepped down gracefully&quot; from his post after a fierce behind-the-scenes contest, Nkabinde's supporters ignored the national directive and nominated him secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Valli Moosa didn't want to accept the nomination until someone warned him the ANC constitution requires all nominations are accepted,&quot; said a delegate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkabinde lost the race to national MP Sipho Gcabashe, but placed sixth in the 13 non- officer provincial executive committee posts - a victory which delegates said also contravened the spirit of the NEC directive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Valli Moosa's efforts to keep Nkabinde and Mchunu out of the race followed Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's warning that national intervention might be needed if the conference allowed internal power struggles to divert it from charting a path for the 1999 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warning came in the wake of ANC power struggles in the Free State, Western Cape and Northern Province, but some delegates argued KwaZulu-Natal's power contest was &quot;completely different from the personal differences which marked the Free State problems. In KwaZulu-Natal there were two issues at stake: cleaning up the party and ideology,&quot; said a delegate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NEC had moved to oust Nkabinde due to his &quot;warlord&quot; reputation in the volatile Midlands, while Mchunu had been directed to stand down to pave the way for Gcabashe to lead the party's mobilisation for the 1999 elections, delegates said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gcabashe &quot;won support partly because of his successes in leading the party to urban victory in the local government elections, but other contestants for the post were pushed aside because of his close relationship to (provincial chairman) Jacob Zuma,&quot; said a delegate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates cautiously welcomed the new leadership, arguing that &quot;on the one hand we now have a united leadership to lead us to 1999, but on the other hand there are concerns this leadership will reject dissenting views,&quot; said a delegate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While KwaZulu-Natal has emerged from a vicious three-way power struggle in 1994 to become one of the ANC's most united provinces, some ANC leaders said this was due to the demise of Zuma's opposition: Midlands stalwart Harry Gwala died last year and former Southern Natal chairman Jeff Radebe was now busy with his national public works portfolio. He did not attend this year's provincial conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One ANC leader argued the problems which had plagued the party in KwaZulu- Natal were &quot;essentially ideological and these differences remain despite the united leadership&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Safety and Security Minister Mufamadi has been landed in another potentially embarrassing legal situation, reports Mungo Soggot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE lawyer who defended Eastern Cape killer policeman Gideon Niewoudt has been hired by Sydney Mufamadi's Safety and Security Department to fight a civil claim lodged by the three widows of Niewoudt's victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The widows, Doreen Mgoduka, Pearl Faku and Stombiwe Mapipa, are suing Mufamadi for loss of support. Their husbands were policemen whom Niewoudt and his accomplices blew up at Motherwell in Port Elizabeth in 1989 for fear they would expose police involvement in the murder of anti-apartheid activist Matthew Goniwe and the &quot;Pebco 3&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advocate whom Mgoduka's and Faku's team will be up against is PJ de Bruyn, SC, of the Port Elizabeth Bar, who has represented the state in other cases involving security police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior officials in Mufamadi's department could not be contacted this week to comment on the irony of the choice of the lawyer the civil claim, which is unlikely to have been made with the direct knowledge of the minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is even more startling about the department's handling of the case is that Mufamadi is understood to have indicated to the widows that he would consider making them ex-gratia payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, Mufamadi was put in the embarrassing position of having an appeal againsta R180000 damages award to a victim of police torture fought in his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first Mufamadi knew of the matter was when the Mail &amp; Guardian published the story. Once alerted, he withdrew the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting at the time on the friction between old-guard civil servants and their new political masters, Safety and Security Secretary Azar Cachalia lashed out in May at the state attorney's office for its handling of police legal matters, homing in on their &quot;knee-jerk&quot; habit of defending claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the choice of advocates for police matters would have to change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel in the torture case argued that the victim, Umkhonto weSizwe cadre Japie Maphalala, should have been accustomed to such abuse because he was a soldier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liability of Mufamadi and the police in the Niewoudt case will hinge to an extent on whether the court decides Niewoudt was acting in the course of his police work when he murdered his colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Niewoudt was sentenced to 15 years' jail in June and Mufamadi's department is currently trying to saddle him with the legal bill for the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi's team is arguing that the plaintiffs' husbands were killed in the line of duty and that they cannot claim compensation in addition to what they are currently receiving from the Workmen's Compensation Scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also arguing that the widows' claims have fallen away, as more than three years have elapsed since the commission of inquiry into the car bomb.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Julian Drew finds out about benefits the Bid company believes the Olympics will bring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN Cape Town began developing a philosophy to underpin its bid for the 2004 Olympic Games it realised the Games would have to make a significant contribution towards redressing the imbalances of the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it was simply about 16 days of sport then we'd have no business doing it but it's precisely because it's about much more than that that we are going ahead,&quot; says the bid's press officer, Paul Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Games are about the R20-billion boost to the economy, the 100 000 jobs that will be created, the new sports facilities in the disadvantaged areas, creating a modern public transport system and many, many more such issues.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Cape Town does not compare favourably with most of the other bidding cities in terms of its current infrastructure, the Bid Company believes the prospects of success are excellent because of the bid's unique focus: &quot;The starting point was that it must be a developmental bid,&quot; said Peter de Tolly who heads the planning team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a very specific social, economic and environmental agenda which stems from the government's Reconstruction and Development Programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bid Company is calling its developmental approach &quot;the fourth pillar of Olympism&quot; - the three official pillars of the Olympic Movement being sport, culture and the environment - which it believes will give it a winning edge over the other competing cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with any project of this size, says the Bid Company, some people are opposed but two opinion polls at the end of last year showed that 80% of the city's population supported the bid. That support has been carefully built through an ongoing campaign that engages communities, schools, the youth and the public at large in critical debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bid Company has held public meetings in 30 different communities and visited over 100 schools throughout the region. There are regular phone-in shows on local radio stations and countless other meetings at which Bid company members have given presentations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our support comes from an understanding of the issues related to the bid and that's really what we are looking for. We don't want a core of people out there who blandly support the bid. We want to acknowledge and address people's concerns,&quot; says Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of those concerns have been related to the cost and funding of the Games. The Bid Company, in the candidature file - the document which it has submitted to the IOC - predicts revenues of nearly R6-billion from staging the Games, leaving a surplus of R100-million after allowing for operating costs. The revenues are to come from television rights, international and local sponsorships, ticket sales and other sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 43% of the capital costs of providing the sports facilities required for the Games are to come from these revenues, says the company, with enough to provide R150-million for a housing fund and R100- million for maintaining the facilities after the Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most important elements for staging a successful Olympics is the transportation network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funding for upgrading the local transport system is planned to come from accelerated government spending: R900-million from the transport budget, which would have been spent regardless of the bid in the Western Cape between 2004 and 2010, will be brought forward and spent before 2004 should Cape Town win the Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The balance of funds for the construction of specific facilities for the Games will come, says the document, from the private sector, national government and the various levels of local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local government share will work out at R43-million a year until 2004, which is no more than the current budget for sports facilities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Charlene Houston argues the land and money planned for the Olympics could be put to better use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Development Action Group monitors the Olympic Bid because we work with poor people in Cape Town to address their housing needs and we are worried about the impact of the bid on the availability of well-located land for housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are concerned particularly that the state will sell prime land at less than its market value for Olympic venues because it believes it is a good project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have asked the Bid company to explain why two large venues planned for construction if the bid is successful have been earmarked for private use after the Games. The Metro Entertainment Centre will be built on land currently owned by the central substructure and the Cape Town Exhibition Centre will be built on land owned by the South African Rail Commuter Corporation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least half of the funding for the construction of the exhibition centre will come from local government but will be in private hands after the Games.  That site had been earmarked a few years ago for high- density housing close to the CBD. That struggle has been lost, but there is a possibility that land could still generate funds for low-cost housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are also uncomfortable with the R86- million in government funds which will be spent on priority projects for the bid, money which will be used to build or upgrade sports facilities within the next few months. Can this spending be justified in the light of other priorities in the city?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are still a substantial number of households in the city which do not have access to water and other basic facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some facilities which are earmarked for upgrading. I have asked the Bid company to explain what is meant by upgrading. Does it mean an existing facility will be razed to the ground to make way for a facility earmarked for another sports code? Or does it mean the facility will be improved?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will foot the bill for the maintenance of facilities? Will rates increase? Will the government subsidise local authorities? These are all questions which remain unanswered and raise fears that there are hidden costs in the bid the public is not aware of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building begins in early 1997 and the Bid company has only been able to provide a guesstimate of construction costs and the value of the rand up until 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult for us to monitor the bid effectively because we are unsure whether there is finality on where all the Olympic venues will be. All we know are the sites of the priority projects. We cannot measure impacts if we do not know where the venue will be. For instance, if there is a squatter settlement directly across the road from a proposed site, we would like to know what will happen to those people. Will pressure be put on the Department of Housing to upgrade their homes? Will they be relocated?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we asked the Bid company for answers, we were told it was difficult to respond because they were working on getting the bid book completed on time.  Then we were told they were under pressure to get the priority projects off the ground. Now we are told they are under pressure to prepare for the IOC's visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We then sent our questions to the Cape Town city council's bid team. We asked for the names of the streets where venues are to be erected. The answer was take a handful of confetti and throw it over a map. Wherever it lands, it is possible there will be an Olympic site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also cannot understand why there is so little transparency from the government on why they decided to support the bid. The Development Bank of South Africa reported to Cabinet on its assessment of the economic benefits of hosting the Games and Cabinet's decision seems to be based entirely on its report. But when we asked for a copy of the report, we were told it was a confidential Cabinet document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of South Africa hosting the Olympic Games in 2004 presents Cape Town with an exciting challenge and a unique opportunity to accelerate reconstruction and development. The Development Action Group is concerned that these challenges are confronted in as transparent a manner as possible and with as much consultation with residents of the city as possible. We are not yet convinced this is being done.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Cape Town Bid company will be rolling out the red carpet for the International Olympic Committee's evaluation commission this week.  But not everybody in the city welcomes the bid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Evaluation Commission is due to fly into Cape Town at 7.35 on Friday (December 6) - its last port of call on an 11-city whirlwind tour around the globe. The commission has to whittle down the 11 cities bidding for the 2004 Olympic Games to a more comfortable four or five cities for the final phase of the bid next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission will spend five days in the Mother City, ending its nearly three-month- long investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission has already visited St Petersburg, Stockholm, Lille, Seville, Rome, Istanbul, Athens, San Juan (Puerto Rico), Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 15 members of the commission have been appointed by the IOC and are led by 1976 Olympic fencing gold medallist Dr Thomas Bach of Germany. The rest of the commission is made up of three other IOC representatives, three from the international sports federations, three from the ranks of the Association of National Olympic Committees, an athletes' representative and four specialists covering the fields of environment, finance and Olympic organising committees.  Several members of the IOC's administration might also accompany the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What they will be looking for is strong public and government support for the bid along with a safety net in the form of government guarantees should the whole venture spiral out of control. A sound, modern city infrastructure and a sizeable proportion of Olympic facilities already in place are also vital elements along with a realistic financial plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bid should also be environmentally friendly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Bach's commission wields considerable power in its ability to halt the lofty ambitions of six or seven of the present 11 candidate cities, it is a relative newcomer to the Olympic bidding process. It owes its existence to the recent transformation of the Olympic Games into the single biggest commercial event on the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the calamitous financial deficit produced by the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal - it ran to $1,8-billion - Los Angeles was the only city brave enough to make an offer for the 1984 Games. Using television revenues and private funding, the city returned a handsome profit of $250- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">God bless American free enterprise, chorused the IOC. Those Games provided the blueprint for all future Olympic Games which now attract an increasing number of candidates with each successive Olympiad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forerunner to the present commission was appointed in 1993 during the campaign for the 2000 Olympic Games when seven cities entered the race. The inquiry commission - as it was then called - was chaired by Swedish IOC member Gunnar Ericsson. It visited the six candidate cities - Milan dropped out before the commission began its work - and compiled a report which was given to each IOC member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document contained charts comparing each city against the themes covered in the candidature files as well as separate chapters highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was prepared to assist IOC members in the vote to nominate the host for the 2000 Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it is debatable how much attention was paid to the document's contents, Sydney's narrow victory met with widespread approval as it was regarded as the best technical bid. The majority of IOC members chose the best deal for the athletes rather than back the political favourite, Beijing, which was supported by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and the big corporate sponsors of the Olympic Movement who were eyeing China's vast, untapped markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the 2002 Olympic Winter Games there were nine candidates and for the first time the IOC decided on a pre-selection process to reduce the number of entrants before letting its full membership loose on the cities. The IOC established an 11-strong evaluation commission - also chaired by Bach - which undertook the same task as the previous inquiry commission. Its report was submitted to the IOC's 10-member selection committee which chose four cities to go forward to the final lobbying stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salt Lake City won the election at the IOC session in Budapest last year after falling at the final barrier four years earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the little over 80 days since the current commission began its journey in the Russian city of St Petersburg on September 16, Bach and his colleagues have achieved considerably more than Phileas Fogg in the same period. Not only have they travelled the world but they have also toured the sites of existing and proposed Olympic facilities and worked painstakingly through each of the 532 questions covering 19 themes in the candidature files of the 11 cities in four continents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This workload is made more tolerable, however, by the convivial surroundings of the world's best hotels along with top-class entertainment, gourmet dining and meetings with royalty and heads of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the commission will carry out its task in Cape Town until Tuesday, it is an almost foregone conclusion that the Mother City will feature among the four or five cities to be chosen by the IOC selection college on March 7 next year. Stockholm, Rome and Athens have the strongest bids in Europe and the IOC, in an attempt to make the contest a global affair, is also expected to opt for one South American city - most likely Buenos Aires - and Cape Town, which is Africa's only representative. The Games have yet to be staged in Africa and the closest they have got to South America was Mexico in 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From April until the final secret ballot on September 5 in Lausanne, the real fun and games will begin for the Cape Town 2004 Olympic Bid company.  Cape Town and the other cities will have to wine, dine, entertain and shower gifts upon the IOC members. Air fares are paid by the IOC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each one of the 110 members of the IOC has the right to visit Cape Town and the other remaining candidate cities - at the expense of the cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The members might also bring spouses and other family members or friends along for the ride. They are not supposed to - only a &quot;single companion&quot; is allowed in terms of the rules - but it has been a common practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the 2000 Olympics the IOC introduced strict new rules governing the visits of members and the presents and other benefits that could be given to them. But there is strong evidence in the book The New Lords of the Rings written by Andrew Jennings and published earlier this year, to suggest that these rules were ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules have been tightened even more for the 2004 campaign and restrict each IOC member and a companion of choice to a three- day visit to each city contesting the final stage of the bid. Gifts are restricted to a value not exceeding $50 for this first phase of the bid and will increase to $150 for the final stage beginning in April. It remains to be seen whether the IOC has the will to enforce these rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has often been said that many an Olympic vote is cast in favour of the city where an IOC member's wife would most like to spend her holidays in seven years' time. If that is true then Cape Town will have to hope that the prospect of dancing the Kaapse Klopse is more appealing than doing the tango or samba or that Table Mountain proves as attractive as the Acropolis, the Colosseum or Sugar Loaf Mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately for Cape Town there are many within the ranks of the IOC who also take the technical requirements of the bid very seriously. After the problems experienced by the far more developed city of Atlanta this year - tacky American free enterprise, chorused the IOC - Samaranch is unlikely to risk awarding the Olympics to an African city with very little infrastructure in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the strong political considerations in giving Africa its first Games - it is the only one of the five continents represented by the Olympic rings which has not yet staged the Games - and supporting President Nelson Mandela's South African miracle, it may be 2008 or even 2012 before the IOC gives a South African city the nod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town is, meanwhile, going ahead bravely and confidently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greetings and meetings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday: Commission to be met at airport by the mayor of Cape Town, Nocsa president Sam Ramsamy and the city's bid chief Chris Ball. The members will stay at the five-star Mount Nelson hotel. The morning will be spent at leisure with trips available up Table Mountain by cable car or to Robben Island. Lunch at the Mount Nelson. Members hold their own preparatory meeting.  Private informal dinner at the Mount Nelson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday: Photo session (five minutes) for the media after breakfast at the Mount Nelson. Introduction to leaders of the regional and local governments, Nocsa and the bid team. President Nelson Mandela might also meet the commission. First bid meeting with the Cape Town delegation. General overview of the bid proposal followed by a detailed presentation on national, regional and candidature city characteristics; legal aspects; customs and immigration formalities; and environmental protection. Light lunch at the Waterfront.  Afternoon session to discuss meteorological and environmental conditions; security; medical/health services; and Olympism and culture. Visit to Newlands cricket ground. Helicopter trip to view local geography and location of facilities. Dinner in Stellenbosch.</SPAN></P>

Lunch at Sports Science Institute in Newlands. Visit Khayelitsha to look at windswept, sandstrewn earthworks that will soon become a boxing venue. Then on to Wingfield to view a disused aerodrome that will undergo a magical transformation into a 2km lake for rowing and canoeing, 75 000-capacity athletics stadium and living accommodation for 15 000 people - if the commissioners and IOC members select Cape Town next year. Discuss Olympic Village and hotel accommodation. Dinner at Cape Town Castle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday: Discuss transport, technology and the media. Discuss finance, marketing and guarantees. Lunch at Parliament. Visits to other venues if required and meeting of commission. Dinner at Constantia Uitsig.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Ken Owen joined the gathering of Afrikaners in Stellenbosch and found their fears unconvincing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO Nelson Mandela and Joe Slovo and, yes, to the cadres who ravaged the townships in the Eighties, I give thanks: they have liberated me to use and enjoy Afrikaans, the only language that properly describes the landscape and the life of my Lowveld childhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many years I denied that pleasure, taking as my guide the bitter adage: Die taal van overwaar in die mond van die verowerde is die taal van slawe. At high school, for five interminable years, I fought a lone batte to preserve my English in a hostile post-war Afrikaans environment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, there was a price to be paid. Some poetic concepts come to me only in Afrikaans, and even today I struggle sometimes to translate my second language into my first. By foregoing Afrikaans, I limited myself and diminished my sensibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the collapse of Afrikaner hegemony has set me free, and I am euphoric.  Never before had I fully savoured the rich endowment in the possession of two languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These reflections have a purpose: they explain both why I joined a gathering of Afrikaans intellectuals amid oaks and white walls at Stellenbosch (where else?) to discuss the future of Afrikaans and why I found their fears unconvincing. I care for the language, and I am confident that it will survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Afrikaans has never seemed to me more secure than since the ruling class of Afrikaners stopped courting the enmity of all mankind. Afrikaans- speakers number six or seven million people and they have a regional power base in the Western Cape comparable to the Zulu base in Natal. The language is both modern and indigenous, and has important lines of support to Northern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The support base is sound. Speakers of Afrikaans encompass a proletariat of (mainly coloured) urban workers, peasants and country-folk, a powerful intellectual community, and a prosperous (mainly white) middle class. These elements are complementary: if the intellectuals provide the angst, the proletarians and the peasants provide stamina and durability, and the middle classes provide the newspaper readers and theatre audiences. It is a formidable alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outlook for Afrikaans then is altogether rosy, provided one does not confuse it with the career interests or the status of the dispossessed white elite, but the group at Stellenbosch would not take comfort. Most were familiar figures from the verligte gatherings of the Eighties, who had done much for FW de Klerk's noble act of capitulation, but now they were caught up in gloom, and the gloom focussed - or pretended to focus - on the language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breyten Breytenbach was there, of course, he who lives in Paris and writes in English but still weaves magic in own tongue; so too was Van Zyl Slabbert, and Ton Vosloo of Nasionale Pers, and Hermann Giliomee and Willie Esterhuyse (hero of the epic battle against Koot Vorster for the soul of the church), and Martie Meiring, and Marinus Daling, Afrikanerdom's economic czar. The belligerently nationalist editor of Rapport, Izak de Villiers, was hilariously paired, in my mind, with that wonderfully reckless poet-turned- journalist Antjie Krog. She marches miles ahead of her people, he marches miles behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were some fresh faces: Jakes Gerwel from the president's office, and Neville Alexander (the world's only remaining undoubting communist, perhaps?); and Adam Small, who once tried to give up Afrikaans as a drunkard tries to give up drinking, vainly; and, for intellectual piquancy, a clever Gujarati- speaking Harvard-trained professor from Uganda, Mahmood Mamdani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamdani, who professed afterwards to have been startled to find an audience 95% white male, offered some interesting insights: Arabic had conquered North Africa because the Arabs defined as an Arab anyone who spoke Arabic; one could become an Arab by learning the language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afrikaans, on the other hand, failed to capture Southern Africa because it divided Afrikaans-speakers by race, alienating the coloured allies who were assigned a lesser status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As always, the debate comes back to problems of definition. Slabbert, perceptive as usual, posed the obvious question. Who is the enemy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who indeed? Breyten made cleverly cruel jokes about the SABC and the werfbobbejane, the tamed Afrikaners, who work there; Martjie Meiring grumbled that the English in Pretoria were undermining Afrikaans; others spoke disapprovingly of the white English racists flocking now to Stellenbosch to escape black people, and then demanding to be taught in English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were mere complaints. As definitions of threat they lacked conviction.  Behind them one discerned, ominously, the long Afrikaner history of &quot; survival&quot; politics. White Afrikaners are above all the children of an open frontier, perpetually insecure. Among the earliest political documents discovered by Hermann Giliomee and Andre du Toit was a petition from the frontier boers beseeching Holland for help to save their children who, without prospects of work, were drifting into the Khoi communities, and becoming absorbed into heathen Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, really, has always been the temptation and the threat - to slip across the frontier - Van Riebeeck's hedge, Lord Graham's line of forts, the mad distinctions of race classification boards - and to become truly African.  To vanish in a greater whole. To be no longer separated, no longer sustained by an umbilical cord to Europe. That fear, unspoken, was detected by Neville Alexander, who warned against the formation of new laagers, but gently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was trying, it seemed to me, to avoid being wounding but, even so, the schism in the soul and the heart, the flaw which has divided Afrikaans church and state and town and family, lay exposed: the old verligte elite is ready to build in helping to build a new South Africa, but not to be subsumed in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those, like Beyers Naude or Derek Hanekom, who have stepped across the chasm, life is easier. One defends one's language by using it, by writing, by teaching, by singing, by offering it in the service of South Africa. Some things English does well, other things Afrikaans does better; and, I am sure, for some purposes Zulu is essential. We are a polyglot of people and we must learn to use our richness of languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find the prospect enchanting but for those who, in the deep recesses of their minds, are still defending frontiers to keep Africa at bay, the future must inevitably seem heavy with gloom. Raka has breached the gates of the citadel and will live among us, as NP van Wyk Louw foretold, forever.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The intitiative to form a new Afrikaans organisation drew the support of the Afrikaans establishment - but not its traditional critics, writes Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONRAD SIDEGO, former South African ambassador to Denmark, assured the last speaker at a meeting of Afrikaans people at the weekend that the colour of her skin had nothing to do with the fact that she had the last word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sidego traded wisecracks with Olga Sema, the only black woman to address the gathering, assuring her that no slight was intended when he decided she would speak last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked afterwards who Sema was, Sidego was at a loss. He knew she was from Gauteng, but he was unsure why she had been billed as a speaker. After inquiring from others, Sidego established that she worked in the Gauteng Education Department.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sema's contribution to the gathering was that she loved the Afrikaans language, and held it more dearly than her home language, Northern Sotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was the only black woman present. The who's who of Afrikaner business, academia, art and media were there: the vast majority of the 80 invited guests were Afrikaner men, but there was a sprinkling of Afrikaner women and fewer than 10 black people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative's steering committee had invited luminaries to debate their proposal to launch an overarching Afrikaans organisation to co-ordinate the disparate actions of the existing 200 organisations servicing the language group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the meeting, steering committee member Ton Vosloo, Nasionale Pers's executive chairman, appealed to the gathering to forward names of coloured and black people who would be interested in joining their ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone who attended was enthusiastic about the initiative. Sceptics voiced fears that the organisation would be dominated by Afrikaners and would further their aims, rather than those of all Afrikaans-speakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative would have to guard against turning its language struggle into a bid to retain privilege, warned Dr Mahmood Mamdani, a Uganda-born professor of African studies at the University of Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He questioned whether it could be an attempt by the &quot;privileged&quot; Afrikaner community to recruit foot soldiers from its less fortunate &quot;cultural cousins&quot; - coloureds who spoke Afrikaans as a first language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Neville Alexander, chairman of the Pan- South African Language Board, said he did not believe the time was right to launch an organisation to promote Afrikaans. &quot;It could be dangerous if it is done in isolation from other language groups. Racial conflict could be disguised as linguistic conflict,&quot; he warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not want to see a situation where we advantage a small group rather than everyone in the country. All this would serve to do is deepen the trenches in South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Zyl Slabbert said he was &quot;ambivalent&quot; about the movement. &quot;I don't want to damage the initiative, but I have reservations,&quot; he said. &quot;Who are Afrikaners? I haven't worked that out yet. We come from different worlds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cabinet secretary Jakes Gerwel, who attended the meeting in his personal capacity as an Afrikaans-speaker, said he had a basic suspicion of an attempt to organise Afrikaans speakers. He questioned whether the initiative was in response to the Afrikaner's loss of political power in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Among working class communities on the Cape Flats, where people also love the Afrikaans language, I have not picked up a need for an Afrikaans organisation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said these people had a legacy of being ostracised in South Africa, but would continue speaking Afrikaans for many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gathering received a tongue-lashing from Afrikaans writer Antjie Krog, who said Afrikaners had a culture of intolerance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether they are in the PAC or the AWB, they are intolerant. Afrikaners do not want to share, they want to rule the roost (baas van die plaas).  Somewhere, they will rule, even if it is in a volkstaat,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't want to share their language with coloureds, they wouldn't share their houses and toilets with blacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her problem with launching an organisation was that it would be controlled by Afrikaners. She asked if she would be regarded as intolerant if she said she did not want to be part of an organisation which was anti-government, anti-ANC, anti-truth commission, anti-English and anti-nation building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the more ardent proponents of the initiatives was Afrikaans writer Breyten Breytenbach who said minorities were under pressure to remain silent in the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not looking to launch a nationalist organisation, an ethnic organisation, a cultural organisation or a kraal,&quot; he said. &quot;We have no mandate to unite all the other groups which exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there is a widespread feeling that something should be done, although we have no more privilege than others and deserve no special treatment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christo Wiese, registrar of the Reserve Bank, introduced himself as a capitalist to the gathering. He argued the movement should take a privatisation route, financing private schools, for instance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Hermann Giliomee, who was on the steering committee of the initiative, said 30% of Afrikaans speakers earned less than the minimum wage.  He asked whether they would be subsidised at private Afrikaans schools. &quot;I am also sceptical of private Afrikaans television. Who is going to take responsibility for coloured Afrikaans- speaking people?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephan du Toit, who introduced himself as an Afrikaans speaker from Transvaal, suggested the Legal Resources Centre be approached to assist with legal assistance to battle for the constitutional rights of Afrikaans. &quot;We no longer have the political rights that we so craftily awarded to ourselves under apartheid,&quot; he pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting ended with a decision to form an exploratory committee, which would remain in contact with all who attended the first meeting and sound out others who were interested in joining.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Give the land back, or develop it? Cato Manor presents the Land Claims Court with its first dilemma. Ann Eveleth reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PENSIONERS Agrippa Cebekhulu (65), Albert Ngwane (67) and Johannes Dlamini (69) grew up side by side in a freehold section of Cato Manor known as Good Hope Estate, on the border of present-day Chesterville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They played soccer together, went to school together and eventually raised their families as neighbours in what was once a cultural heartland in Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cato Manor was one of the very few places our fathers were able to buy land in those days,&quot; recalled a misty-eyed Cebekhulu. &quot;Our mothers and fathers were good neighbours who felt the pleasures and pains of life together. When someone died, we all attended the funeral. If you had a party, there was no need to send out invitations.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cebekhulu was reminiscing with his former neighbours this week during a break in South Africa's first Land Claims Court hearing tasked to decide between two pillars of the new South Africa - land restitution and housing - which are in conflict in Cato Manor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cebekhulu's fond childhood memories soon gave way to the familiar pain and anger so easily evoked among former Cato Manor residents. &quot;Our happiness ended with the Group Areas Act,&quot; he said wistfully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three men were in their 30s when the government declared their fathers' land a &quot;white&quot; area, piled their families into trucks and dumped them in surrounding - and separate - black townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our fathers were never compensated for that land. The police just picked us up in trucks like animals with guns at our backs,&quot; said Dlamini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you have a family, you try to prepare a nest egg for your children.  Can you imagine the pain of having that taken away? Some of our fathers couldn't take it, became weak and passed away,&quot; remembered Ngwane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 30 years after their &quot;extended family&quot; was severed by apartheid, the three men have come together in a new struggle to regain the lost land of their fathers. They are only three of the estimated 160 000 people uprooted from Cato Manor by the Group Areas Act and other draconian legisation, and they are among the 200-odd claimants most determined to reclaim the plots &quot; where our umbilical cords are buried&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These 200 claimants - out of more than 2 500 land-restitution claims registered in the area - spent this week trying to convince the Land Claims Court's first official hearing to reject an application by developers to prevent them from claiming back their land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cato Manor Development Association represents the national Housing Board and the provincial and local governments' development interests in the area. It wants claimants to be forced to settle for other land or financial compensation for their losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think the claimants can be accommodated within the development itself, although a successful application would prevent them from receiving the exact land they lost,&quot; said the association's land manager Dave Smiley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association argues its plans to build about 30 000 low-income houses and other developments in the area over the next five years represents a greater public interest than does restoration of land rights nullified under apartheid legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most claimants have not officially opposed the association's application in terms of Section 34 of the Land Restitution Act, the issues for those who have are complex and emotionally charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some claimants - like Cebekhulu, Ngwane and Dlamini - say they want to return to live on the land that was stolen from them. Ngwane, for instance, says it will decrease his bus fare by two-thirds - a significant saving for a pensioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, like 54-year-old Ganesh Rampersaad, say they are afraid of being &quot; robbed&quot; a second time. &quot;My father passed away shortly after the Group Areas Act was passed. Before he died, someone offered to buy our house and the land where we grew vegetables for market for R50 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government refused to pass the estate into my mother's name after the Act came in, and then forced her to sell for R7 850. After the bond payment and rates, I think she got R2 000. What can you do with that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like so many forced-removals victims, Rampersaad's life was fundamentally altered by the eviction: &quot;We had to move into a dark rented basement in Chatsworth. We lost our market income. Half my salary went to rent, and we had to split up the family because the landlord wouldn't take all of us. My mother died soon afterwards, and my life was taken up with paying the rent,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rampersaad said he was forced to delay marriage until the age of 37 because he couldn't afford a home. He has had to borrow money to send his eldest child to technikon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the association says it wants to build low-cost housing on my land, but their plans show it is an industrial site. Maybe my family could form a consortium and sell it for R200 000, but how much compensation are they going to give me?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smiley said the problem the association faces if the application fails is how to proceed with the R130-million Reconstruction and Development Programme contract the association has with the provincial government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of the objectors participated in the forum which created the association. A particular vision for the area was agreed to, and we're now trying to implement it. We are undertaking the biggest inner-city development in the world, and it is impractical to restore the land to its previous uses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing has been adjourned to January 20.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) has been ordered to rework its year-end accounts after the auditor general uncovered glaring errors in its figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The auditor general's office, which is also investigating allegations of financial mismanagement at the organisation, told the IBA it would be futile to present its March 1996 figures to Parliament as they were so inaccurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An internal investigation quietly ordered by IBA councillors to pre-empt the official probe has also uncovered serious failures in financial and management controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA was given until last weekend to rework the year-end figures - compiled by its finance department and consultants Dlamini &amp; Ngidi - and was due to present them this week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy auditor general Bertie Loots said his auditors had not found any &quot; skulduggery&quot; in the IBA's finances. But the errors were rudimentary, and the reporting performance was well below that expected from an organisation commanding so much public money. The IBA's annual budget is R37- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Loots said his officials also found the IBA had weak expenditure and credit controls, and it had failed to balance various accounts. The auditor general's office made similar complaints when it signed off the IBA's accounts for the year to March 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reworked figures will be included in the investigation into the mismanagement allegations, where the auditor general is liaising with the public protector. A full report is expected late next month, Loots said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings raise fresh concerns about the IBA's finance controls - an issue at the root of staff allegations against senior IBA officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council's own internal inquiry has found the IBA has no clear policy on its councillors' credit cards - central to the public protector's probe - and incomplete records for its travel account. The IBA cannot trace flights and other travel which have cost it R250 000, organised by former travel agent Leading Tours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquiry, started 10 days ago, is being undertaken by public relations consultant Patrick Weech. His findings will also be presented to the auditor general and to the public protector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBA representative Amos Vilakazi blames the finance department's performance on its high staff turnover. It has lost three heads in the past 11 months, and current head of department Thandi Sodaba leaves at the end of this month after a three-month stint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vilakazi said the IBA was also not happy with Dlamini &amp; Ngidi, who were paid R33 000 a month for six months' work, according to documents with the public protector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBA co-chair Peter de Klerk, who is among those singled out by staff, said councillors had raised the department's performance with chief executive Harris Gxaweni, which led to the departures of Sodaba's predecessors. &quot; Gxaweni is accountable for whom he appoints,&quot; De Klerk said. &quot;Of course we came down on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vilakazi said Gxaweni appointed Sodaba on a three-month contract to avoid the lengthy process of finding a new finance head. Sodaba can apply for the position permanently, but has not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sodaba has experience in the Eastern Cape public sector, but is not a qualified accountant. He has known Gxaweni for seven years and lives with him in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk did not know Sodaba was leaving. He said he thought the three months was merely a standard probationary period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weech refused to comment this week, but sources say he has been asked to go through each of the allegations, in many cases ascertaining whether the IBA has a relevant policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weech has found the IBA has no policy, for example, on whether it should pay its senior officials' cellphone accounts. It paid R2 840,71 for Gxa- weni's cellphone bill in September; many of the calls were to the Transkei, his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions have also been raised about expenses from a 1994 trip to Japan, attended by co-chairs Sebiletso Mokone-Matabane and De Klerk, and councillors John Matisonn and Lyndall Shope-Mafole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquiry is checking whether the councillors, who received advance expenses for the trip, used the IBA's Diner's Club credit card on top of claiming daily per diem allowances. So far, only one of the four, believed to be Matisonn, has provided full documentation for the claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents show Shope-Mafole approved the cheque for the R8 790 claimed by Mokone- Matabane for the trip. Gxaweni approved the R16 758,21 claimed by Shope-Mafole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation's staff have been ordered to co-operate fully with Weech, and provide any documentation he requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matisonn refused to comment, but other sources said it would not be surprising to see him leave the IBA before the end of his remaining 16 months with the organisation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the consumer's best friend, Isabel Jones has always been powerful. But with the help of a new Act that was quietly passed by the Gauteng legislature in September, the consumer journalist will now be able to shut down a business, strike down contracts, and impose fines of up to R200 000 and jail sentences of up to five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones will be one of five members of Gauteng's new consumer court, a tribunal armed with massive powers which has, in the words of a senior University of the Witwatersrand law academic, &quot;come like a bolt from the blue&quot; .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set up two weeks ago under the province's new Consumer Affairs (Unfair Business Practices) Act, the court's importance has largely passed Gauteng lawyers by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act's preamble reads: &quot;Whereas people have the right not to be exploited as consumers; and whereas in our modern society and in the light of the common law, people are inadequately protected against consumer abuse ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pierre Naude, a partner at Deneys Reitz who is one of the few Gauteng attorneys familiar with the new Act, says: &quot;There appears to be little doubt that the Act probably will have far-reaching consequences for many of our corporate clients and insurance policies will have to be scrutinised even more carefully than before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naude said that by far the most important weapon in the court's armoury was the power to strike down clauses in contracts which clashed with the Act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most other lawyers approached this week knew very little of the court's powers, and if they did, expressed reservations. But a common verdict was that the court's establishment was replete with &quot;noble intentions, but has very serious implications&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is some concern about the suitability of some of the tribunal's five- person team. Jones's colleagues include businesswoman Angie Makwetla, advocate Matilda Masipa and attorney Ellen Frances. Its chairman is attorney Willie Seriti, a leading light in the Black Lawyers' Association, while advocate Margie Victor, who recently became the first woman to be elected to the Johannesburg Bar Council, will serve as alternate chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These officials will be dealing with life- determining amounts of money,&quot; said one Johannesburg attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naude says that once a complaint has been lodged the court can summon the accused business to court to set about stopping its &quot;unfair business practice&quot; . It can also interdict a business from continuing anything related to an &quot; alleged unfair business practice&quot; before proceedings begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the court believes an &quot;unfair business practice&quot; exists, it can order the business to close down and reimburse consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the industrial court, the consumer court will not rely on precedent - a decision which alarms some lawyers. Others say this approach will allow the court to arrive at equitable decisions instead of being inappropriately locked into the approach set by a previous, similar case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Act that sets up the court has also established a consumer protector, which will serve as the first line of defence. Both the protector's office, which will be able to search premises for documents, and the court will have unfair business practices in their sights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Tangled events ranging from alleged diamond dealing to bribery are being unrolled in a Pretoria court, reports Stefaans Brummer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS week's corruption trial of Ferdi Barnard, Charlie Landman and Gert Marais revealed all the elements of a Frederick Forsyth novel: meetings between a &quot;rogue&quot; top cop and the deputy president, an alleged state assassin- turned-common crook in an unholy alliance with the cop, claims of arms-for- diamonds deals between an African rebel leader and two powerful ex-ministers .  ..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally intriguing was the legal cast assembled. Prosecuting were the &quot; untouchables&quot; of Transvaal Attorney General Jan D'Oliveira's crack Special Investigations Unit, led by Deputy Attorney General Antoinette de Jager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defending Landman was former Witwatersrand attorney general Klaus von Lieres und Wilkau, aristocratic in bearing but tainted by his active private practice since he left office for &quot;medical&quot; reasons last year with a huge severance package.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incongruously, the scene for the drama was a lower court - Pretoria Regional Court, indecorous courtroom Number Four - and the threesome in the dock faced charges sparked by a paltry R20 000 alleged bribe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Civil Co-operation Bureau (CCB) member and alleged assassin Barnard, former Brixton Murder and Robbery Squad detective Marais and suspended Brixton acting commander Landman were facing charges they had conspired in late 1994 and early last year to have a counterfeit-dollar investigation against one Fanie Nel squashed in exchange for the bribe. (Nel was subsequently convicted).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was heard in court this week that Barnard, Marais and Landman - the latter referred to in testimony as &quot;the big man&quot; and &quot;the mighty Landman&quot; - met Nel and his brother Deon at a Roodepoort restaurant on January 6 last year. Landman, indeed, was &quot;big&quot; in police circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before his suspension earlier this year he had a reputation as one of the country's top murder and robbery detectives. In 1994 and last year he was heading a special investigative team into the unsolved &quot;red mercury&quot; murders of the early 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That investigation had been given top priority after Landman and investigative reporters took the matter to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki in 1994. By all accounts, channels between Mbeki and Landman remained open after that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also undisputed was the defence's assertion that two days after the restaurant meeting, Landman saw Mbeki and Mufamadi to tell them Fanie Nel had information linking former foreign affairs minister Pik Botha (then mineral and energy affairs minister in the Government of National Unity) and former defence minister Magnus Malan to arms-for- diamonds deals with Jonas Savimbi, leader of Angola's Unita rebels, and that they had told Landman &quot;to go ahead with the investigation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five days after that, on January 13, Landman saw Cape Town Attorney General Frank Kahn, asking him to withdraw the counterfeit dollar charges against Fanie Nel in exchange for Nel providing information against Botha and Malan, as well as on the red mercury murders. Kahn refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where the accounts differed was the state's contention that Fanie Nel never offered the information - that it was a ruse on Landman's part to have charges against Nel withdrawn in exchange for R20 000, half of which had already been paid to Landman's co- accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One may wonder why Landman would have gone to the extraordinary lengths to see the deputy president and his own minister, and then an attorney general, with a fabricated story - all for a R20 000 bribe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was another twist. On the evening of Landman's meeting with Kahn, the Nel brothers were allegedly robbed near Klerksdorp of diamonds worth more than R10- million by Barnard and two associates, who had led the Nels to believe they would introduce them to a discreet buyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The buyer never materialised and Barnard's two associates made off with the diamonds after a wild shoot-out. Barnard and two co- accused are standing trial on the matter in the Klerksdorp Regional Court. The state in the present case appeared to be insinuating that Landman's actions were connected to that diamond robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the defence and the prosecution appeared to be letting Botha and Malan off the hook: the state by arguing Landman's assertions were a ruse; and the defence's statement that Landman at the time thought there was something to this information, but later found it to be untrue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Nel brothers, now state witnesses, denied Fanie Nel had offered Landman the information. Intriguingly, Deon Nel did testify that the topic came up at the restaurant meeting with Landman and his co- accused, but was raised by Landman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deon Nel said they spoke about a Lichtenburg diamond mine, owned by businessman Albert Vermaas, which had gone insolvent. Landman, he said, told them the insolvency was because the mine's books falsely reflected diamond production which had in fact been Botha's Angolan diamonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incidentally Vermaas was convicted this week in the Pretoria Supreme Court on 111 charges ranging from fraud to exchange control irregularities after a trial of more than five years. In his judgment, Justice F C Kirk-Cohen said Vermaas had considered asking Botha and Malan to stop the Reserve Bank &quot; interfering in his affairs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The trial was continuing at the time of going to the press</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Government proposals to give itself swifter powers to intervene on crisis-hit campuses are likely to face a rough ride from universities and technikons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plans - part of the Ministry of Education's Green Paper approved by Cabinet on Wednesday - follow a spate of campus upheavals, in which state intervention has been largely confined to commissions of inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Education Sibusiso Bengu is calling for an independent assessor who would be his &quot;rapid reaction instrument&quot;, officials say, in cases involving corruption and violence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal was not among the recommendations of the National Commission on Higher Education - the basis for the Green Paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tertiary education sector, which jealously guards its autonomy, says the plan has been sprung on it, the rules are unclear and ministerial intervention could be a recipe for disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Committee of University Principals acting chief executive Dr Johan Brink says the sector does not welcome the ministry's proposals. &quot;If it is argued that universities cannot solve their problems and so need an independent assessor, such a person would need to be a superman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Nasima Badsha, personal assistant to University of Cape Town vice- chancellor and principal Dr Mamphela Ramphele, says UCT would prefer exhausting its internal mechanisms, rather than using an outsider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhodes University vice-chancellor David Woods says the proposal would ultimately leave South African higher education no better than its peers across Africa &quot;where presidents appoint the vice-chancellor&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Green Paper will go through a consultation period until next March. The ministry plans to present a higher education Bill to Parliament later next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l The Commission of Inquiry appointed in June to probe the ongoing conflict at the University of Durban-Westville has cost taxpayers nearly R1,4-million to date, with more than 80% of costs accounting for payments to two commissioners, the Department of Education said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela appointed the commission following a clash between supporters and opponents of former Azapo president Itumeleng Mosala's application for the rectorship.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A crack squad of advisers led by the Ministry of Finance's highly-paid consultant Charles Stride has gone into Transnet to help fill the R12-billion hole in the parastatal's pension fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry said this week Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus had recruited Stride following the roasting she gave Transnet in Parliament six weeks ago. The pension crisis is the key obstacle to government efforts to privatise Transnet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human resources boss Joe Ndhlela is the only Transnet executive involved in the project. Gloria Serobe, responsible for Transnet's pension fund, has been excluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Stride has recruited 12 outside advisers, including merchant bankers, accountants and an auditor provided by the British government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a Transnet operation,&quot; he says. Stride, who earns R380 an hour from the ministry, is to report back to Marcus next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pension fund hole dates back to Transnet's creation in 1990, when it took over the pension fund from South African Transport Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deficit is spread across subsidiaries such as South African Airways, Spoornet and Portnet, rendering it virtually impossible to strike a price in any privatisation sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stride says on paper the fund has an actuarial deficit of R3,24-billion - the figure shown in Transnet's latest accounts. But the real deficit is R12- billion as Transnet cannot meet the interest payments on debentures worth R8, 5-billion, issued as an initial attempt to bring the deficit down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government had ordered Transnet to pay part of its earnings each year to the fund to fill the hole. Stride says there was never any &quot;reasonable expectation&quot; it could meet that goal. The parastatal suffered a R253-million loss for the year to March, after paying nearly R2-billion in pension fund costs, including R423-million in interest on the debentures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stride says a solution will involve the taxpayers' pocket and a reduction in pension fund benefits. He declines to be drawn beyond saying the plan will be &quot;fairness all round&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Marcus's concerns raised in Parliament was that former managing director Anton Moolman, former chairman of the pension fund, had received a lump sum payment of R3- million and R62 600 a month as pension. Transnet was also paying out R185-million a year in pensions to people who were not yet 50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marcus challenged Minister of Public Enterprises Stella Sigcau, who is responsible for Transnet, to solve the fund's problems. Sigcau's representative says she approached the finance ministry for help before Marcus's challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A preliminary investigation at Transnet subsidiary Portnet's head office in Johannesburg has concluded it has no proper controls over outside consultants it employs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We noted two cases where confirmation of engagement was signed ... without the mention of the assignment to be done and the amounts to be spent. The consultants had been given delegated authority to sign for payment on behalf of Portnet for expenditure up to R100 000,&quot; internal documents state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Taiwan on Thursday hit back at South Africa's decision to cut diplomatic ties, announcing it would shelve most of its aid projects in South Africa and recall its ambassador.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister John Chang told a press conference in Pretoria that 85% to 90% of its aid projects would only be resumed once the two countries had worked out a formula for a new relationship.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The snub came a day after President Nelson Mandela said South Africa would maintain relations at the highest level short of diplomatic ties. Mandela said Taiwan was &quot;a very close friend&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chang made no mention of cutting trade or investment ties - trade between the two countries hit R5,7-billion last year and Taiwan is considering major investments, including a $3-billion petrochemical project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was reported Chang, who arrived in South Africa on Tuesday, addressed the press conference after meeting his counterpart, Alfred Nzo. But Nzo left the conference before Chang made his announcement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Edward Dutton, the flamboyant Johannesburg businessman who fled his R205-million forex fraud trial to Australia three years ago, has been released from jail after a Sydney court ruled he should not be extradited to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African officials working on the case are baffled by the outcome of the hearing which last Friday ended Dutton's 13-month stint in a maximum security prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they are not giving up pursuit of the former Interboard managing director whose two year trial in Johannesburg had cost the state R8,4-million by the time he skipped bail on the pretext of a dentist's appointment in February 1994. The case against him hinged on allegations of an ambitious &quot; roundtripping&quot; scheme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One official at the Office for Serious Economic Offenses (OSEO) in Pretoria said the South African legal team - from OSEO, the Reserve Bank and the Johannesburg attorney general's office - would now prepare new legal argument for Dutton's extradition in light of the Sydney magistrate's ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton, who changed his name to Michael Addison when he arrived in Australia, won the day with the help of a law in the state of New South Wales which makes it harder to admit evidence obtained in another country, according to OSEO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said the outcome was particularly disappointing because Australian lawyers briefed by the South Africans had said their entire case was admissable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks before Dutton's Sydney hearing began his counsel, William Barber of the Sydney Bar, flew to South Africa to visit Justice Minister Dullah Omar and Truth and Reconciliation Commission representatives to &quot;put Dutton's side of the story&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton claimed his competitors as well as key officials in the former government had wanted him out of the picture and had framed the charges against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barber said Dutton had been very successful as head of hardboard business Interboard and had angered apartheid officials with his avant garde policy of not discriminating against blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one stage during his marathon Johannesburg trial Dutton said he was a Selous Scout - a claim dismissed by representatives in South Africa of the notorious Rhodesian squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, another famous South African fugitive from fraud charges has had a less successful innings in the English courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver Hill, who lost his extradition hearing two months ago, on November 22 lost a district court bail application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed his continued incarceration at London's Brixton Prison was giving his wife, Lynne, at least two &quot;panic attacks&quot; a day. Hill added that the &quot;oppressive regime&quot; in South Africa would not give him a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Judges Staughton and Tucker rejected the bail application, saying Hill faced serious charges and had made clear his unwillingness to return home to face trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They ordered Hill, who is known for his litigious bent, pay the costs of the hearing. According to Britain's Crown Prosecution Service, Hill's British legal bill so far is about R3-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill is alleged to have pioneered an ingenious &quot;roundtripping&quot; money making scheme that cashed in on South Africa's dual currency system with the help of forged Eskom bonds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Omar's failure to get any concessions from Pagad has cast doubt on his ability to hold his present positions. Rehana Rossouw reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUSTICE Minister Dullah Omar's failure to rein in Pagad is fuelling fears that he cannot juggle his ministerial position with his role as ANC leader in the Western Cape.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political observers believe Omar's performance at a summit with Pagad on Tuesday was ludicrous - one suggested the organisation had him by &quot;the short and curlies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar has not been able to wrest a single concession from Pagad, despite months of negotiation. His attempts to draw in all sectors of government and the security establishment in addressing Pagad's concerns have been met by its constant refusal to operate within the framework of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But political observers say there are many factors militating against Omar in his attempts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar has been Pagad's prime target in national government, and his home has been besieged by them as well.The organisation has marked him as a soft target because he is seen as a Muslim leader in government. Omar is rooted in the Cape Flats, particularly in the Gatesville area which is Pagad's known stomping ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another factor that puts Omar squarely in Pagad's sights is his position as leader of the ANC in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe if he was not chair of the ANC he could have dealt with Pagad far more clinically as justice minister,&quot; said a political observer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Omar's position may be causing him to disregard advice on Pagad's political agenda. As head of intelligence, he must be extremely well briefed on the political forces at play in Pagad, yet he panders to them constantly.  This can only be because he is concerned about the ANC's support base in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is allowing his position as ANC leader to overshadow his justice portfolio. He is far too soft on Pagad and he is setting a dangerous precedent for other anti-ANC forces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar has also received very little support from Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, observers believe. &quot;Crime in the Western Cape is not his line function, yet Mufamadi has walked away from the problem,&quot; said a criminologist. Mufamadi's representative denies this, saying his initiatives to combat crime in the province have yielded results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC Western Cape secretary James Ngculu said the call this week for Omar's resignation from his position as ANC chair was outrageous. He said people had made similar remarks when Mandela engaged right-wing whites but had to concede afterwards that it had helped to prevent civil war in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who are looking for a hard-hitting, security force approach to Pagad are going to be disappointed. Pagad has to be engaged at the highest level and Dullah has our full support,&quot; Ngculu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other anti-crime initiatives in the Western Cape are also concerned about the outcome of Tuesday's summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Western Cape Anti-Crime Forum (WCACF) warned this week that Pagad's intransigence could lead to further conflict in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pagad should try to work with the authorities and other community-based initiatives. You can't fight crime by disregarding the law. You can only win the battle against crime by organising and developing communities,&quot; said WCACF spokesman Irvin Kinnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his organisation was working with Omar and supported his efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pagad must realise that Omar has inherited a justice system which in the eyes of many communities has been unjust for decades. Omar still sits with the remnants of that system and people must realise there are those limitations,&quot; Kinnes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar was not available for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - John Bredenkamp, the billionaire behind Francois Pienaar's Saracens deal, is a shady arms dealer who has already been ditched by Nick Price. Mungo Soggot and Peta Thornycroft report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE billionaire who set up Francois Pienaar's transfer to British rugby club Saracens is a shady arms-dealer-turned- sports-mogul who was recently ditched by golfer Nick Price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Golfing insiders confirmed this week that Price had recently severed ties with his long-time friend John Bredenkamp, a fellow Zimbabwean who made his fortune peddling tobacco and arms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pienaar, South Africa's sacked rugby captain, told Beeld newspaper this week that he had been eyeing English clubs for the past year and that Bredenkamp had introduced him to Saracens' boss Nigel Wray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative for the South African Rugby Football Union said the union had not been aware of Bredenkamp's involvement in the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bredenkamp, who has strong links with South Africa, quit arms dealing and entered the sports world two years ago. But colleagues say he has had trouble shaking off old habits. &quot;It was just a matter of time before he (Price) would ditch him,&quot; said a former colleague, who claimed Bredenkamp's use of arms industry business tactics clashed with the sports world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bredenkamp's sports company, Masters International, dealt with South African golfer Ernie Els, who had earlier also parted company. It manages cricketers, rugby players and chess world champion Garry Kasparov.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Bredenkamp's Masters International executives is former Armscor boss &quot;Kotie&quot; Coetzee, who lives near Bredenkamp's Ascot mansion outside London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men can be linked to some of the world's most dubious covert arms deals in contravention of United Nations embargoes. Some of the deals originated in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from his liaison with Armscor in his arms-dealing days, Bredenkamp is known to have allowed at least one operative from South Africa's military intelligence to claim to work for his tobacco company while active in the Southern African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extraordinary tale of Bredenkamp's liaison with Price was recently told by United States-based sports magazine Sports Illustrated, which dubbed Bredenkamp &quot;the most mysterious man in golf&quot;. He is estimated to be worth $350-million. &quot;One could argue that Bredenkamp has mismanaged Price more than managed him,&quot; wrote the magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one instance, Price, on Bredenkamp's advice, signed a 10-year deal for more than $25-million with a two-year-old Californian golf club company. At the time Price was number two in the world. The idea was that the company would produce a series of golf irons which would be promoted by Price. But it never produced the clubs and the company collapsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bredenkamp told the magazine he had learnt his lesson: &quot;What I learnt from the experience is that I wouldn't just want to hear what the company was going to do; I'd want evidence of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A documentary made two years ago by Britain's Channel Four television programme Dispatches described in detail Bredenkamp's lucrative arms deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the documentary, Bredenkamp, who once captained Rhodesia's national rugby team, worked for Ian Smith's government, in the service of which he developed his sanctions-busting skills - first with tobacco and later with arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He formed a tobacco company called Casalee, named after his two daughters Caron and Sara, and his wife Lee. Casalee's industrial arm fronted a massive arms dealing operation which was active in most of the world's trouble spots - in particular Iran, to which he sold land mines and anti-aircraft guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On several occasions the documentary dwells on Bredenkamp's knack of co- opting state officials and policemen. Early on in his career he was charged with contravening Rhodesian trade legislation. However, the charges fell away and the investigating officer in the case, Robert Jolly, is now a Casalee executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Channel Four also commented on the Belgian police's sudden decision to back- off investigating Bredenkamp's sale of arms to Iran. Channel Four accused Bredenkamp of bribing staff at a major international arms manufacturer to secure commissions for himself and established he had set up a secret company to receive commissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite his former Rhodesian ties, Bredenkamp later developed a good relationship with several Zimbabwean officials involved in that country's defence portfolio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said one sports management insider: &quot;It is only a matter of time before the rugby world wakes up to the realities that the US has woken up to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bredenkamp failed to return calls from the Mail &amp; Guardian this week. Price, who is playing golf in Zimbabwe, could not be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biloxi, Miss - Sen. Hillman T. Frazier (D-MS), a long-time advocate for strengthening relations between the United States and African countries, said, &quot;It is an honor for my state to host the 20th Annual Legislative Conference of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators (NBCSL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frazier, a member of NBCSL's Committee on International Affairs, said, &quot;I am especially pleased to have in attendance representatives from organizations that are working so actively to help Americans learn about Africa, a continent of great promise which faces myriad challenges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panelists representing international, labor and non-governmental organizations called upon members of the NBCSL and their constituents to learn more about Africa and to take the lead in shaping relations between the United States and Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee was chaired by Arkansas Rep. Irma Hunter Brown, who recently has traveled to South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia, as part of an NBCSL delegation. Brown said, &quot;I felt that the depth and breadth of information provided during the workshop was astounding. The destiny of the African American community is inextricably linked to our ability to become successful actors on the international scene, especially with regards to Africa. Through this meeting, we have continued a dialogue which will lead to concrete actions vis-a-vis our role in helping shape U.S. policy towards Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panelists at the session were: Melvin Foote, Executive Director of Constituency for Africa(CFA), Dumisani S. Kumalo, a South African serving as Projects Director of The Africa Fund; Juliette D. Lenoir, Assistant to the Executive Director of the African-American Labor Center, and Cassandra D.  Waldon, Non-Governmental Organization Liaison Officer of the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants included legislators, a representative of the Nigerian Government, and a former Burundian ambassador to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A theme of the session was that African American state legislators must play a more active role in mobilizing US-Africa trade opportunities and in guiding U.S. policy towards Africa. &quot;One of the true challenges is to provide more and better information about Africa to the legislators in particular and to the African American community in general,&quot; said CFA's Mel Foote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suggestions put forth include: using the Internet as an information source; convening a policy conference on Africa for the legislators in Washington, D.  C&gt;, and organizing town meetings across the U.S. on issues related to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee recommended, for consideration by the organization's full body, a number of resolutions, including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* support for legislation promoting international trade, but protecting U.S.  jobs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a commitment to help reaffirm American support for the work of UNDP in Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* support for The Africa Fund's efforts to organize a Washington, D.C.  policy forum for state legislators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A controversial resolution for support of the government of Sudan will be debated. The resolution session, Saturday, Dec. 7, from 9:30 am to 12:00 noon, will be closed to the press.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Ouagadougou declaration, approved at the end of the conference, the leaders expressed support for the Organisation of African Unity's mechanism for Conflict Prevention and Management, and for the use of sub-regional structures with the vocation of avoiding crises.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders appealed to all Africa's partners to be attentive to the sectors which directly affect economic growth and for them to provide these sectors with appropriate help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They applauded the Special Initiative for Africa, launched by United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, as well as the proposal for a New World Partnership for Development, made by the G-7 group of most industrialised nations during their last summit, held in the French city of Lyon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ouagadougou declaration contains an annex in which the heads of state commit themselves to mine clearance efforts and to fight for the elimination of anti-personnel mines. They welcomed aid programmes that facilitate demining and humanitarian assistance for mine victims, and pledged to cooperate with these operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa is the continent most severely affected by anti-personnel mines. At least 20 African countries are seriously affected by this scourge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders expressed deep concern at the fact that every week land mines killed or maimed hundreds of people, mainly women and children. Furthermore, the devices hinder economic development, and block the repatriation of refugees and the return of internally displaced people to their zones of origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following his participation in the summit, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano began a private visit to Burkina Fasso on Saturday, at the invitation of President Blaise Campaore.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA (PANA) - Ghanaians began polling Saturday in parliamentary and presidential elections as the incumbent, Jerry Rawlings, seeks a second term as a civilian leader of this nation of 16.2 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polling started on schedule at 0700 gmt. Long queues built up long before the polling booths opened.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 9.3 million voters are expected to cast their votes at 20,000 polling centres between 0700 and 1700 gmt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others vying for the presidency are John Agyekum Kufuor and Edward Mahama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 740 candidates from seven parties and independents are contesting 200 parliamentary seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana's Electoral Commission has distributed 40,000 transparent ballot boxes and about 10 million ballot papers to the constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elections are being monitored by observers from the United States, the United Nations, the Commonwealth, the Organisation of African Unity and local non-governmental organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first results are expected early in the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a nationwide radio and television broadcast Friday, President Rawlings appealed for a peaceful, orderly and transparent conduct of the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let us each go calmly to our respective polling stations, cast our votes and then politely leave the area unless we have some authorized duty to perform there,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told voters that all political parties had authorized representatives at each polling station and as such there was no reason for supporters to remain within the voting perimeter after casting their ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the evening, as we await the first results, whether at home or in public places, we should not express our joy or disappointment in such a way as to provoke, insult or antagonize others,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The eyes of the world will be on Ghana. Our stability and orderly democratic process, which have won the respect of the international community, investors and other observers; are precious and hard-won national assets,&quot; he said. &quot;Let us not throw them away in the unguarded emotions of the electoral race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings said equally important was the need for Ghanaians to establish a tradition of orderly democratic procedure so that the social and economic development of the country could take precedence over partisan rivalries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Today) is our chance to set the seal on this tradition by conducting ourselves with maturity and patriotism,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Failure to seize this chance, he added, would undo &quot;at one stroke&quot; so much of what Ghanaians had sacrificed and achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We shall all be the losers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources close to the council, upon whose recommendation the 185-member General Assembly elects a secretary-general, listed other possible candidates as O.A.U. Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania; Wally N'dow of the Gambia, secretary-general of the U.N. Centre for Human Settlements and Moustapha Niasse, Senegal's foreign minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Nov. 19, the United States vetoed Boutros-Ghali's second-term candidature, blaming him for inadequate reform of the world body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Boutros-Ghali got the votes of the council's 14 other members, the U.S. veto barred him from nomination by the council but technically did not remove him from the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 15-member council has decided to give African candidates priority in the selection process, to give the continent a chance at a second mandate, as has been the practice with those of other regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boutros-Ghali's decision Wednesday to suspend his candidature, despite being endorsed as Africa's candidate at the July O.A.U. summit, opened the way for other African candidates to come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However Boutros-Ghali, 74, has said that he remains in the race. His term of office expires Dec 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other Africans are among a list of nine candidates proposed by non- governmental organisations and individuals for the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are retired Gen. Joseph Garba, a former Nigerian foreign minister and Paul Adjandjagori of Gabon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, these candidates are not being considered by the council because they were not backed by any member state, as required by U.N. guidelines for the selection process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - A United Nations official from Ghana -- Kofi Annan -- is now being punted by diplomatic insiders as the most likely successor to UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report in the 'Sunday Times' here Sunday says that this situation has emerged following a rash of high-level lobbying centering on President Nelson Mandela of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says President Mandela spoke to American President Bill Clinton earlier in the week, asking him to reconsider the emphatic US veto which ended Boutros-Ghali's chances of a second term of office. Mandela is thought to have proposed a continuation by Boutros-Ghali for a limited period -- possibly a year -- while Africa sorted out who it would like to recommend for the position.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But President Clinton is believed to have stuck to the US view that Boutros- Ghali should go and that Africa should now nominate a candidate to replace him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in a telephone conversation with President Mandela last week French President Jacques Chirac is reported to have said France would support a limited extension of Boutros-Ghali's tenure, and would use its Security Council veto to block any alternative candidate unless he or she is from a Francophone African state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This French threat, the 'Sunday Times' report adds, is believed to have effectively scuttled any hopes for the secretary-general of the Organisation of African Unity, Salim Ahmed Salim, who is from Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against the background of these developments, South African diplomatic insiders are reported to have pointed to Annan -- UN Under secretary-general and head of the UN peacekeeping operation -- as the man most likely to negotiate the diplomatic minefield which lies ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other possibilities being mentioned are Ivory Coast Foreign Minister Amara Essy; Olara Otunnu, a former Ugandan ambassador and head of the International Peace Academy in New York; Senegalese Foreign Minister Moustapha Niasse; and former Prime Minister of Niger Hamid Algabid, who is secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the Security Council has chosen a nominee, his or her name will go to the 185-member General Assembly for ratification. The intention is to complete this process by Dec. 17 -- which is in a matter of eight days' time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - President Nelson Mandela has appealed to the 20-member team of evaluators from the International Olympic Committee to select the South African city of Cape Town as the venue for the 2004 Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Give us these games,&quot; he said in Cape Town on Saturday, &quot;we are ready for them and the whole of Africa is backing us up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town is the last port of call on the I.O.C. team's whistle-stop world tour of the eleven cities vying for the opportunity of hosting the 2004 Olympics. The team - headed by Dr. Johan Bach - have experienced perfect weather since their arrival and, judging by the smiles on their faces after meeting with the South African leader, Cape Town must be in with a chance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After discussions with the team, President Mandela was in light-hearted mood, telling the media that he had not asked the IOC for the bid: &quot;I told them to give us the bid,&quot; he joked. Continuing in this vein, he said that Cape Town had grown close to his heart in the 27 years that it had hosted his colleagues and himself - a reference to the nearly 30 years he spent incarcerated on Robben Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bach and his team are spending five days in Cape Town, investigating the city's capacity for and commitment to holding the Olympic Games. He has also rejected all attempts to keep the team away from the media and opposition groups. No unstructured interaction with these groups had been planned, but soon after arriving Bach insisted on meeting them and initiated the necessary dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The I.O.C. team will return to Lausanne later this week, and are expected to make their recommendations for four or five of the eleven candidate cities early in the new year. A final decision on the city which will host the 2004 Olympic Games is not expected before September next year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With provisional results from 37 of the 200 constituencies released, Rawlings has 750,014 votes compared with 631,591 for his main rival John Agyekum Kufuor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings' NDC has 22 seats while Kufuor's new patriotic party has 15 seats.  Mahama's people's national convention has none.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings is doing well in all parts of the country except Ashanti where Kufuor has his stronghold. Even there, Rawlings has made some gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings has lost his chief whip, Bosomtwe Sam, his employment and social welfare minister David Sarpong Boateng and northern regional minister A.B.  Fuseini.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - The United States Trade and Development Agency, TDA, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Mozambican government Monday, covering planning assistance for a wide range of infrastructural projects in such areas as transport, energy, water supply, agriculture and mining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signing the agreement were Mozambique's national treasury director, Manuel Chang, and the agency's director, Joseph Grandmaison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essentially, the agency funds feasibility studies and trade-related training and conferences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency has already granted one million dollars for feasibility studies in Mozambique. This breaks down into 675,000 dollars for an aluminium smelter project, 300,000 dollars for the Alto Malema Dam in Zambezia province, and 264,000 for sugar production in Maputo province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency's funds are only available on the condition that the recipient country contracts a U.S. firm to do the work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency's largest funded study, for the aluminium smelter, went to tender in November 1975. The tender was won by Reynolds Aluminium, which is sharing with the agency the 1.3 million it cost to conduct the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study is looking at where to put the proposed smelter, its economic viability, the amount of energy needed, capital and operational costs, and market prospection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duke Engineering and Services is putting up a further 200,000 dollars to the 300,000 from the agency. This will go to study the viability of the dam, which would produce 60-80 megawatts of electricity. Power from the dam could support mining and irrigation projects in Zambezia, as well as the reactivation of the tea-processing industry, largely destroyed by Renamo rebels during a lengthy civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency is also providing the Swazi government with 295,000 dollars to study the viability of linking the Swazi and Mozambican electricity networks through a line running from the southern Mozambican city of Matola to the Zambodze substation in Swaziland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documentary, aimed at discrediting Kaunda, was scheduled for broadcast on television Sunday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZNBC television had been running commercials of the documentary in which they alleged that Kaunda, in conjunction with the independent newspaper, the Post, had been campaigning for the donor community to withhold aid to the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka High Court Judge Edmond Sifanu granted the injunction Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda, as applicant, had earlier Sunday filed his affidavit in the high court through his lawyer, Mwangala Zaloumis, against ZNBC as the respondent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the announcement of the election boycott by his United National Independence Party in October, Kaunda had said that he would make President Frederick Chiluba's administration ungovernable through donor sanctions in the following six months after the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain (the former colonial power), the United States and other bilateral Western donors and development partners have withheld balance of payments support to Zambia.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richardson told Sudan Television Sunday he was happy that the hostages would be spending Christmas with their relatives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were the planes pilot, Capt.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - A consultative group meeting of the Children's Vaccine Initiative opened Monday amid concern over Africa's low accessibility to existing and new vaccines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the meeting in Dakar, Senegal's health and social action minister, Ousmane Ngom, said that although hopes were being raised for new vaccines, the major worry remained whether the vaccines would be readily available to the African public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited the case of the vaccine against hepatitis B which, although now in its third generation, &quot;is still inaccessible&quot; to most people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our responsibility over the next two days will be to see how the countries of the world -- including the countries in Africa -- can benefit from existing and new vaccines without delay,&quot; the Children Vaccination Initiative executive secretary, Dr Jong-Wook Lee, added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative was launched in October 1990 during the World Children's summit in New York. The effort brings together diverse organizations and experts to help provide better protection of children against diseases through the development of new and Bimproved vaccines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization's regional director for Africa, Dr Ebrahim Samba, urged African governments to budgets for effective vaccination programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called, particularly, for an onslaught against measles, which kills up to 5.55 million African children annually. He said measures should equally be extended to defeating neonatal tetanus, which causes 250,000 deaths each year and polio, which cripples at least 12,000 children each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samba noted that a new awakening was developing among African countries to vaccinate as many children as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even in countries in conflict like Angola,&quot; he said, &quot;the warring factions temporarily stopped their fighting so that children could be vaccinated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said that the high cost of vaccines remained an impediment to implementation. While 14 vaccines were available worldwide, he said, African countries have access to only six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking later at a press conference about the Ebola virus, the WHO director-general, Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, said it was one of the new viruses that was bound to emerge with the ongoing climatic changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Maxime Shwartz of the Paris-based Pasteur Institute noted that the Ebola virus was more deadly than AIDS because it kills 90 percent of the infected persons within a few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola cannot cause an epidemic as it only infects people who were in direct contact with the fluids of a patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, Shwartz said, more research was required to find the animal reservoir of the virus so as to find ways of protecting humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerning the dismal performance of the Colombian-discovered synthetic anti-malaria vaccine, he a more effective vaccine could be discovered, easily, since a good number of Africans already have immunity against the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's highlight at the Consultative Group meeting will be an event to be hosted by Children's Vaccine Initiative. This will show how the vaccine industry is a partner in the fight for children's health and in the eradication of polio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the initiative will honor individuals and organizations who have made outstanding contributions to protecting children through vaccinations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SINGAPORE (PANA) - Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong opened the first World Trade Organization (WTO) biennial ministerial conference Monday, with an appeal for help to developing countries so they could integrate their weak economies with the multilateral trading regime created by the WTO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that developing countries must be given time to adjust to the changes brought about by the Uruguay Round of trade talks, both in the rules and the pressure of market opening measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The concerns of the less developed countries that they are being marginalized in the emerging global trading environment must, in particular, be addressed,&quot; Tong told the estimated 5,000 delegates attending the meeting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Realistically, global trade liberalization has to progress in an incremental manner, even though some of them prefer quantum jumps,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WTO, he said, had a crucial role to play in this process, so as to maximize the mutual benefits of the new global economy and enable the WTO create a strong, effective and credible multilateral trade regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If protectionist sentiments surface and roll back the significant goals the WTO has achieved, then global economic prospects for the future will become dimmer, instead of brighter,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, he said that developing countries must be assisted to fulfill their commitments and obligations to the WTO. With the creation of this trade body income is expected to increase by at least 500 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The WTO should bind together and help the less developed members catch up and benefit from the vast opportunities of the global marketplace,&quot; he said. &quot; Together, WTO members must put full and faithful implementation at the top of their agenda, critically study the progress we have made so far and ensure that the considerable gains of the Uruguay Round are maximized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tong said among other initiatives, the WTO must ensure that member countries continued to reduce tariff and remove non-tariff barriers so as to stimulate global trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the WTO system is to be held together, it is critical that it is not polarized by any north-south divide, putting developing and developed members against each other,&quot; he said. Rather, he added, &quot;effort should be made to ensure that there are equal opportunities to benefit from the process of global trade liberalization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tong also questioned the wisdom of discussing at this meeting the so-called &quot;new issues&quot; concerning labor standards and investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said labor standards, particularly in the poor WTO member countries, should not be &quot;used a disguised protectionist measure&quot; by the industrialized countries to stem imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As for investment, no-one disputes the link between trade and investment but there is no agreement on when and how best to address the issue within the WTO,&quot; Tong said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC Mkushi North constituency vice-secretary, Fabius Mulusa, said today all political parties should sit down and resolve their differences peacefully.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mulusa said his party in Mkushi does not want leaders who are longing for violence which might plunge the country into chaos and unnecessary loss of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He condemned some Zambian political leaders he did not name but whose comments have always advocated for violence saying these people have no heart for the Zambian people adding that losing an election should not lead many to violence but that the losers should respect the winners as all in the election was done fairly and democratically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever since UNIP decided to boycott last month's elections its leader, Kenneth Kaunda, has been talking about civil disobedience and other acts which might bring instability to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the elections the ZDC national leadership also joined the band-wagon claiming that the elections were not freely and fairly conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both local and international monitors have came up with a definite conclusion that the presidential and parliamentary elections had been held in a free and fair atmosphere and those losing had lost simply because they were not popular.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The elections are over in Zambia, and the diminutive Fredrick Chiluba 55, has been sworn in for a second term as president of the southern African nation of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba, who horned his political skills in the rough and tumble of the trade union movement in Tanzania, Mozambique and Zambia before ascending to the presidency in 1991, appears little concerned by opposition-fanned reports that a military coup is in the offing in Zambia. Chiluba's Movement for Multiparty Democracy, MMD, won a landslide victory in the presidential and parliamentary polls, taking 131 of the 150 seats parliament. He says it was an honest victory and has credited his faith in God for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His MMD party says the heavy turn out - 1.3 million out of the 2.2 million registered voters - was an indication that the people of Zambia supported the ruling party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so, say the opposition. The elections were boycotted by seven political parties including the top potential contender, the United National Independence Party (UNIP) of Dr. Kenneth Kaunda. Kaunda ruled Zambia for 27 years, before losing to Chiluba in the 1991 elections. Kaunda, 72, was barred from contesting as a person on the basis of a controversial constitutional amendment that bars presidential contenders whose parents were born outside Zambia. Kaunda's parents were born in today's Malawi though he himself was born in Lubwa parish, northern Zambia. A bitter Kaunda, who was Zambia's first President after independence in 1964, said of the May 15,1996 Constitutional amendment: &quot;I am a Zambian and I am ready to defy this discriminatory law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the basis of traditional lore he argued: &quot;My umbilical cord was buried at Lubwa and my parents are buried there too. Culturally, it is held in Africa that where one's umbilical cord is buried is proof of his origins and therefore roots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guy Scott, a former Minister of Agriculture and now leader of a farmer's party, the National Lima Party, attributed MMD's victory to the work of mammon. Scott said while there may have been no outright rigging, the cumulative effect of a series of electoral malpractices has led to Chiluba's disputed victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited the case of a polling assistant who openly boasted he had been paid to mark balloting papers in favour of the MMD. &quot;In rural Zambia many people are illiterate. If the ballot papers are marked for them by biased officials, victory may go the opposite way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MMD also had the advantage of incumbency and used government resources flagrantly, charged Scott. &quot;In one constituency we counted only two vehicles for the opposition while the MMD had 25.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott is fully convinced the MMD could not have won seats in rural Zambia on the basis of their agricultural track record which he described as dismal.  &quot;They must have won on the basis of something else&quot;, said the leader of the farmers body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Vernon Mwaanga, chief campaigner for Chiluba and a former Foreign Minister in both Kaunda's and subsequently Chiluba's administrations, dismissed opposition charges that the polls were rigged. &quot;We did not enjoy excessive advantage. Incumbency alone will not necessarily guarantee victory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwaanga pointed out that when UNIP of Kaunda lost power five years ago they were the incumbents, but that did not stop the MMD from winning. &quot;The elections are about winning and losing and the opposition should accept it all in good spirit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say the biggest test for Chiluba will be in the weeks ahead.  Kaunda has vowed not to rest until the Chiluba administration is brought to account for what he considers to have been fraudulent elections. Kaunda has called for a national strike sometime this December. However, judging by the poor turn out of about 3,000 at a demonstration he organised in the capital on December 1, most Zambians appear to believe that having ruled Zambia for close to three decades, Kaunda already had his chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coalition of opposition parties in Zambia called Opposition Alliance, which includes Kaunda's UNIP, appears ready to dice with danger as well as unconstitutional means to have their way. The independent Post newspaper whose editor Fred Membe is vehemently opposed to Chiluba, reported two weeks ago that the alliance had written to South African President Nelson Mandela warning him and other regional leaders of a possible military coup in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Chongwe, leader of the Liberal Progressive Front who wrote the letter on behalf of the Alliance, warned that if no &quot;timely action&quot; was taken, a military coup could not be ruled out in Zambia due to the &quot;fluid situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter urged the South African Development Community SADC comprising regional southern African nations not to sit back and watch. Mandela is the current chairman of SADC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alliance appears to believe that some sort of economic sanctions should be imposed on landlocked Zambia along the lines of the sanctions imposed on Burundi by the Eastern African regional Heads of State after the military coup that brought Major Pierre Buyoya to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela is inclined towards Kaunda because when Kaunda was in power he gave a lot of support to the African National Congress (ANC) whose guerrillas fighters had a base in Zambia during the bitter years of conflict against the apartheid regime in South Africa. Indeed Zambia's impoverished economy has sometimes been blamed on Kaunda's pre-occupation with wars of liberation in Southern Africa when he was in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week before the Zambian elections on November 18, Chiluba paid a short trip to South Africa where Mandela urged him to postpone the elections until the contentious issue of the Constitutional amendment affecting Kaunda had been sorted out. Chiluba rejected Mandela's plea out of hand and state media in Zambia asked Mandela to keep off Zambia's internal affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A victorious Chiluba is unfazed by accusations that he is resorting to strong arm tactics to silence his opponents. Ten days after the elections he ordered the bank account of a coalition of independent election monitors frozen after they had slated the elections &quot;unfree and unfair.&quot; His government also sacked six journalists working for state media on allegation that they were sympathetic to the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this has not gone down well with the western donor community. Zambia's economy is over dependent on the export of copper which is in glut on the world market. The country can ill afford to annoy providers of western largesse. Chiluba knows this fact well and has kept it in cognisance while choosing his new cabinet; all the names that western donors had said they did not want in the cabinet were kept out. These include Vernon Mwaanga, his chief campaigner who was forced to resign from the cabinet in 1993 after accusations that he and others in the government were involved in trafficking the drug &quot;Mandrax&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment the United States, Britain, Sweden and Japan are not happy with the whole electoral process and the Constitutional amendment that preceded it. As early as June, Britain said it would curtail its 20 million pounds aid programme to show displeasure over undemocratic trends in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba will have to tread cautiously. Failure to win donor support could result in the collapse of the economy and widescale civil strife in one of Africa's most peaceful countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bukavu - A group of 52 handicapped Rwandan refugee children, saved by dedicated Roman Catholic priests from fighting in eastern Zaire last October, have returned to a home for the handicapped in Rwanda, the missionary order said on November 28. This ends their nearly 2 years of exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the handicapped children were carried by the priests on their backs through mountains to safety at the height of the fighting between Zairean forces and Zairean Tutsi rebels, known as the Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As shells rained down around their mission and Tutsi rebels advanced on the regional centre of Bukavu, eight priests -- six Belgian and two Zairean -- decided to escort their charges, aged between 11 and 18, to a safe refuge in the hills, Brother Bernard of the Brothers of Charity explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children, mostly physically handicapped but including two who were visually impaired, one blind and three mentally handicapped, were showing increasing signs of panic as the fighting neared, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We decided to leave. There was savage fighting in the region. It was the safest thing to do. Half the town's population had already left. We could see them passing by, so we joined them. We must have been the last to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Four priests stayed behind and the rest of us took the children. We were helped by some of our local novices and we formed a group of about 100 people altogether,&quot; Brother Bernard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We found ourselves caught up in the human tide of people fleeing to the hills. It was a miracle that we even managed to stay together. In the end it took us four days to cover the 15 kilometres to Kabare, west of Bukavu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the handicapped children were able to move unsupported or with the aid of sticks, but most needed regular attention to keep them marching, and many had to be carried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ragtag cohort of children, novices and priests slept rough the first night in pouring rain, and in a small hut and an abandoned church the following night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They spent a total of 10 days away from Bukavu at what they considered was a safe distance, waiting for a clear picture of the situation to emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talk about a calvary, it was literally that. So many of the children had to be carried. Everyone was exhausted. The road was uphill all the way. We must have climbed 400 metres,&quot; Brother Bernard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the heavy fighting during that first day of flight, there were no casualties among the priests and children, though one brother tore a ligament climbing the hillside and is still limping a month later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One child was lost. &quot;It was on the first night. We were still mingled among the thousands of other people fleeing,&quot; the mission chief said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joseph, the blind child, somehow lost his guide in the confusion. It was only when it got dark that we realized we had lost our Joseph. Apparently he was later seen in Kisangani, but we've had no news of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children had arrived in Zaire from Katagara in central Rwanda two years ago, following the 1994 civil war and genocide of more than 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They formed part of a larger group of around 80, some of whom earlier returned to Rwanda and reunited with their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the latter group returned on November 28 to Rwanda and to Katagara, where the Brothers of Charity run a well-equipped home for the handicapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of them appeared happy to be returning to Katagara, which they fled in 1994, though it was unlikely they would find parents or other family to welcome them once they got back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas, 15, said he had no idea whether his parents were alive, and expressed no interest in looking for them, while Gratien, 17, from Cyangugu region, said he intended to make enquiries about his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty handicapped children who had also formed part of the refugee group had already returned to Rwanda because members of their families applied to have them brought back. The present group were those who either had no family or whose relatives had not inquired about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brothers of Charity is a Rome-based religious order with missions in 17 countries around the world. Its 700 priests working in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America specialize in teaching and psychiatric work, particularly with handicapped children, both physical and mental.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zaire, the organization has five missions: at Bukavu, where they have been present since the influx of Rwandan refugees in the east of country two years ago, and at Kinshasa, Kanaga, Katwambi and Lufhambo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rwanda they have missions at Katagara, near Kigali, where they run a home for the handicapped, and at Butare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brother Bernard, one of six Belgian and two Zairean priests teaching at Bukavu, has lived and worked in the region since 1962. Trained as a missionary in Belgium, he spent six years in Rome, and has travelled widely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He helped organise the flight of the handicapped Rwandan children during the civil war and genocide of 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his years teaching at Butare, moreover, he helped educate the great majority of Rwanda's present leaders. &quot;All the Rwandan elite passed through our hands. Butare became a centre for the teaching of leaders,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a group of 39 children lost in the human tide which swept in from Zaire last month also returned to their mountain-top village in central Rwanda on December 2 with uncertain prospects for resuming their former lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Villagers at Bushoki, 50 kilometres north of Kigali, turned out by the hundred to see the children return, ferried in by workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross after spending two weeks in an orphanage in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no effusions of emotion, either from the parents, family members and friends or from the returnees themselves, aged between four and 14. &quot; Rwandans aren't like that,&quot; a local official said. &quot;They keep it bottled in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children had been away for more than two years, having fled to eastern Zaire in the closing stages of the 1994 civil war. They had become detached from their parents or escorts during the mid- November exodus that saw more than half a million refugees flood in from the camps around the eastern Zairean border town of Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have reasonable hopes of being reunited with one or both of their parents or at least with members of their family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others face an uncertain future. Nine-year-old Elias lost both his parents during the war and was taken in hand by a neighbour during his time in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He trudged the 50-kilometre journey from the Kahindo refugee camp to Gisenyi, in Rwanda, on foot, but lost his escort. He had no idea who was on hand in Bushoki to greet him, but he hoped it would be the neighbour who helped him through his exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean-Bosco, 13, from the Katale camp west of Goma, lost touch with his father who is believed to be still hiding in the Zairean forest. His mother died during the war. There was no one in Bushoki to greet him, and questions brought tears to his eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll carry out searches in the region,&quot; the local official said. &quot;If we can't find any relatives, he may have to come back to the orphanage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 4,600 unaccompanied children -- orphaned or simply lost -- were registered after the Goma exodus, of whom 1,500 have already been reunited with parents, families or friends, ICRC spokesman Nina Winquist-Galbe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They form part of greater problems of Rwandan children scattered by the winds of war, of whom the ICRC has registered more than 95,000 throughout the Great Lakes region since August 1994. Of these, 40,000 are still searching for their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid officials are particularly concerned at the fate of the unaccompanied children, possibly numbering several thousand, still languishing in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of these are probably being used as slave labour by the Hutu militiamen,&quot; the spokeswoman said. &quot;If they're big enough to carry arms they're likely to be used as soldiers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, despite their sober demeanor, the villagers of Bushoki were reliably said to be pleased to see the return of the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One woman, the aunt of a returnee, wore a tee-shirt carrying the advertising slogan for a brand of American cigarettes. It read: &quot;You've come a long way, baby.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kisumu - When he left his rural home in Migori District, in the south- western corner of Kenya, David Otieno was full of great expectations. And why not? He was armed with a Grade C Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education.  Getting a well-paying job, replete with all the liberal perks that go with it, would not be much of a problem. So he set out for Kisumu, Kenya's third largest town after the capital Nairobi and tourist-attractive Mombasa on the Indian Ocean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kisumu is on the shores of Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world. It is four years hence, and Otieno's dream job is not forthcoming. His idea then was a sedentary job in an air-conditioned office.  He could imagine himself in a chic suit and a silk tie to match as he signed vouchers for the day's little expenditures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this was not to be. Looking for this kind of job turned into an horizon- chasing affair. Then he began to look for &quot;any&quot; job. One day, he encountered an Asian prospective employer who sneered: &quot;Taka kazi kabila gani (What kind of job are you looking for?)&quot; To which Otieno answered: &quot;Any&quot;. The elderly turbaned wholesale businessman suggested that Otieno start taking care of his toilets and gardens immediately. This offer so infuriated Otieno that he had a good mind of punching the man on the nose, but instead he walked away dejected and frustrated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The job hunt continued. But Otieno watched in disbelief as his elder brother, with whom he stayed, came home with wads of bank notes every evening.  The notes were Nicholas Owino's earnings from the sale of water for domestic use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owino had not acquired the educational level of his younger brother. Thus, the 24-year-old Otieno decided that pushing the hand-cart loaded with 12 jerry-cans of water all over the residential estate was his big brother's just desserts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can I join you in that God-forsaken work?&quot; Otieno sneered when invited by his brother to join him in the water hawking business. &quot;Why did I go to school at all--all 12 years of it? I could as well have stayed home to wait till I was old and strong enough for this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was before. But now Otieno had come face to face with reality. No more Alice-in-Wonderland ambitions. Water hawking was the only job left for him.  He asked his brother and parents back home to help him buy a 12-jerry-can hand-cart like Owino's. They complied and soon Otieno was the proud owner of a Ksh 20,000 (US$400) cart replete with 12 jerry-cans, each costing Ksh 50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right now Otieno is well into his second year of water business and he cannot look back. &quot;How I regret the two years I spent looking for an office job,&quot; he laments. &quot;Within one short year, I have been able to put up a semi- permanent house at my rural home. I have also got myself a wife and paid the Ksh 5,000 ayie (symbolic fee paid by the groom to show his commitment to the envisaged union) and the 13 head of cattle without outside help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Besides, I manage my affairs pretty well. I hold an impressive account at Barclays Bank and will use those funds to buy a plot on which I wish to build another home in town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otieno is one of the 500-odd men, young and not so young, who sell water to the 500,000 thirsty Kisumu residents. In fact, the water business has become so lucrative and attractive that an unkept, sweat-drenched man pushing a ton- weight of water around the residential areas is a common sight indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of Kisumu's water supply facilities were put up in the 1950's when the population was a meagre 80,000. The facilities, like other social service equipments in the town, continue to find it extremely hard to keep pace with an ever increasing population. According to the 1989 census, Kisumu is home for a quarter of a million people. But modest estimates put the current population at double this number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Kisumu We Want&quot; convention of December 1993 came up with startling data about the town's water situation. According to the convention report, the town's water demand of 50,000 cubic metres a day is a far cry from its hitherto capacity of 20,000 cubic metres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The convention indicted a number of factors for this disparity. These included the municipal council's failure to adjust the water capacity to keep pace with the population growth, poor maintenance leading to leaks and the advent of water-quaffing industries like Kenya Breweries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem with the Kisumu water is not only its scarcity. It is also poorly treated, making water-borne diseases such as typhoid fever, amoebic dysentery, common dysentery and diarrhoea the major medical complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Odera, a medical practitioner who operates a clinic at the sprawling Manyata Estate, says: &quot;Although this is a malaria-prone area, over 80 per cent of my clients are typhoid, amoeba, dysentery or diarrhoea cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal authorities maintain that the water is treated well enough, yet this does not seem to be the case as the incidence of these diseases does not abate. Recently a government chemist stirred a hornet's nest when he told a seminar in the town that the water was &quot;unfit for human consumption&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elijah Tonui, the Kisumu District chemist, meant well with the comment. But the municipal authorities, led by Mayor Lawrence Akinyi Oile, were up in arms.  They accused the government official of exaggerating the situation and of inciting the residents against the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other sources within the council are honest enough to admit that the water is either under or over-treated. Mostly the former. The proceeds from what is spared from the underdoing goes into individuals' pockets, quite in tune with the corruption greedily eating into the very fabric of the Kenyan society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Kisumu water is impure and disease-laden, one is pretty lucky to have it flowing in the tap. Of course, the rich and mighty living in Kisumu's posh estates can afford to water their gardens and wash their cars with large hoses. But water taps in most of Kisumu are a vain decoration in the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A physics professor, who was recently transferred from Nairobi University to the nearby Maseno University College, was lucky enough to find a good house to rent. After two months in the house, but without a drop of water from the taps, he received a Kshs 4,500 bill from the council. But, being a clever man, he did not bother to complain and demand the correct bill. He called Town Hall and asked them to come and carry away the meter, arguing that he did not see the purpose it was serving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town hall complied. The meter was removed. My professor friend has not been billed again. He has not been showered either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The water situation in Kisumu is assuming crisis proportions. In a town in which the circulation of money is despicably low due to endemic poverty in the area caused by its political neglect and marginalisation, this essential commodity is getting out of reach to most of the residents. And this, in an area bordering the second largest expanse of fresh water in the world!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 20-litre jerry-can of water costs Ksh 10 in most of the residential estates. In the new middle-class estates like Migosi the rate can reach Ksh 20 during drought times. Thus, a family of 10 members who use 20 jerry-cans a day spend Ksh 200 a day on water, or Ksh 6,000 per month. This is the salary of a middle-class civil servant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inadequacy at the mains may be the major problem. But the situation is exacerbated by some unscrupulous residents, most of them council workers, who divert the supply to their private selling kiosks. These kiosks never run dry even during the driest of times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water traders get their supplies from wells sunk by individuals or from such kiosks for one shilling per jerry-can. Thus, a dealer makes a Ksh 108 profit from one trip of 12 jerry-cans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A strong man can do 10 trips a day, pocketing a cool Ksh 1,080, or Ksh 32, 400 a month. How many university graduates earn this kind of money wherever they may be working?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes the water trade difficult to curb, let alone stop, is the fact that some council workers are involved and that it is such a big employer.  The council's efforts at a more reliable and satisfactory supply will thus be frustrated by the kiosk owners and the hawkers. They will collude with the council's water and sewerage department staff to cause artificial shortages to make their trade indispensable. It seems the cycle may never end.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Kenyan church leaders have reacted sharply to a drafted &quot; religious&quot; Bill which the Kenya government intends to take to Parliament for enactment &quot;soon&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill, The Religious Bodies Registration Bill 1996, has been prepared by the Public Security and Public Order Laws Task Force, under the auspices of the Kenya Reform Commission in the Attorney General's Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It intends, among other things, to regulate, register and control religious organizations in this east African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft Bill, whose copy was made available to APS, seeks, among to establish a religious Affairs Advisory Committee, comprising 10 members and a chairman, who will be appointed by the Attorney- General for a period of three years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill also envisages that the committee's chairman should be a retired judge or a retired priest. Nine committee members would be representatives of the various religious faiths in Kenya, while the 10th member would be a representative of the security services of the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill also states that the selection of representatives of the various religious faiths &quot;shall be in the discretion of the Attorney-General after consultation with their representatives&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his reaction, Archbishop-elect of the Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) Dr. Rev. David Gitari, said &quot;the Anglican Church in Kenya totally rejects the draft Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are worried that the Government can draft such a Bill. We cannot accept it whatsoever&quot;, he said on November 30 at Saint Andrews Theological College, Kirinyaga, while addressing a religious congregation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The church will rise up and say NO to any move to table the Bill in Parliament for debate,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Anglican clergyman asked the country's education minister Joseph Kamotho, who was present, to convey their (church leaders') sentiments in this regard to the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Catholic Secretariat, the headquarters of the Catholic bishops' council, said the bishops would be meeting soon to deliberate on the issue. &quot;The bishops are soon going to converge in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, to deliberate on this issue, among others&quot;, he told APS in a telephone interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the National Council of Churches in Kenya (NCCK), Bishop Joseph Wesonga told APS in a telephone interview that &quot;the national church organization was deeply concerned with the issue. It has a lot of implication on the day-to-day life of the Kenyan churches; hence we are currently making consultations with the government's legal authorities over the matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retired Anglican Archbishop, Manasses Kuria, wondered what had prompted the Kenyan government to draft the &quot;harsh&quot; religious Bill. &quot;Personally I see nothing beyond the Bill apart from being yet another legal attempt by government to interfere with the religious freedom that Kenyan Christians are currently enjoying,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Organization of African Instituted Churches of Africa (OAIC), said the organization was totally against the Bill, because &quot;this will have more negative implications on some of the indigenous churches, which were yet to be registered in accordance with the laws of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was specifically alluding to Section 5 of the drafted Bill, which states that &quot;no association of persons, body or organization shall engage in any religious activity as a religious body unless and until it is duly registered as a religious body in accordance with the provisions of this Act&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of religious men and women in Nairobi known as Prayer Maombi, in their reaction to the proposed Bill, described it as unconstitutional because it unjustifiably limits the enjoyment of the freedom of worship, which is enshrined in the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It should not be encouraged especially at this time when many controls are being removed,&quot; they observed in their statement. &quot;It gives excessive powers which if placed in wrong hands will be abused&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By trying to put all the faiths together, the Bill ignores reality as far as religion is concerned and the special circumstances prevailing in Kenya,&quot; the religious group further stressed, pointing out that &quot;it was drafted hurriedly, poorly and contains errors and inconsistencies and therefore it should be rejected&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 8 (3) of the Bill stipulates what could happen to any person who establishes a religious body contrary to the provisions of this Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any person who founds or establishes a religious body contrary to the provisions of this Act or who fails to comply with any of the conditions of registration imposed under subsection (3) of section 7 commits an offence and in addition to any criminal prosecution that may be instituted against such person, the minister may after consultation with and the advice of the registrar prohibit the operation of the body&quot;, the proposed Bill stipulates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Opposition Alliance, a local political alliance for opposition parties in the country, has also joined churches in opposing the enactment of the Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at Athi River town, some few kilometres from the Kenyan capital, on December 1, the Alliance's leaders said the Bill was aimed at silencing &quot; God's messengers from delivering the message they have been given for the world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its chairman, Mr. Mwai Kibaki, said it was a pity that some leaders contemplated blocking God's mouthpiece from pointing out evil. &quot;The Government is drunk with power and now wants to usurp God's role as the head of the church&quot;, he stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a turn of events, the general secretary of the ruling political party, KANU (Kenya African National Union), Mr. Joseph Kamotho, denied on December 1 that the government had ever drafted any Bill to control regulation and registration of religious organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Kamotho, the government had set up a committee to look into ways of checking the mushrooming religious cults. &quot;The government has no intention of taking a contentious Bill to Parliament&quot;, he said, adding, &quot;Even President Daniel arap Moi will not accept something which is not acceptable to the majority of Kenyans&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 29, the Acting chairman of the Law Reform Commission, Mr. J.F.  H. Hamilton, while admitting that the proposed Bill had been drafted, said &quot; it (the Bill) is far from being tabled in Parliament.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Pauline Riak, the chairperson of SWAN, told the crowd at KICC, &quot;When social disintegration occurs in the society, women are expected to build relationships and the social fabric of human living through care and nurturing. The physical and psychological costs are high as women try to build stable lives amidst the massive internal and external population movements that are occurring,&quot; she explained.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Association is strengthening exiled and refugee women and has brought a strong sense of unity as well as a desire to work for their common good. SWAN was begun in February 1984 and has 494 members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem common to SWAN members is violence against women. &quot;Domestic violence not only causes women and children physical and psychological suffering, but is also a major obstacle to individual growth and women's participation in development,&quot; Dr. Riak said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SWAN is unique in that it was conceived, developed and managed by urban refugee without initial prompting or input from other individuals. Further, its members are heterogenous and are active participants in various warring factions inside Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Riak recognizes that Sudan is still at war. &quot;Our questions have to do with dignified survival and the struggle for a just peace and national development,&quot; she explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of the November 30 event was &quot;SWAN IS A SYMBOL OF UNITY AND LOVE&quot;.  Participants came from Nairobi, Kisumu (in Western Kenya) and seven African countries including Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and Sudan. Tribal dances were presented, locally made clothes, baskets and other items were on exhibition and traditional foods were also cooked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SWAN has organized previous workshops on various topics such as stress control, HIV/AIDS and self reliance, how to make homes, and participation in nation building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the conflicts ranging among us in the south, the cultural activities are quite impressive,&quot; one member remarked.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goma, Zaire - Religious authorities in eastern Zaire have expressed concern for the safety of a former Roman Catholic bishop who has not been seen since Zairean Tutsi rebel army personnel seized him on November 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monsignor Phocas Nikwigize, 77, the former Hutu bishop of Ruhengeri in western Rwanda, was taken by a military official and three soldiers of the rebel authorities as he attempted to cross back into Rwanda, members of a missionary group in Goma reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former bishop had accompanied tens of thousands of his parishioners into Zaire after they fled Ruhengeri in the closing stages of the 1994 civil war in which Hutu militias massacred more than a million Rwandese, mostly Tutsis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nikwigize was prevented from crossing the Zairean border and driven away in his own car by a military official, a missionary with the White Fathers here said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No word of him has been received on either side of the border despite inquiries by aid workers in the region. It was clear by late Sunday that he had not entered Rwanda. We're afraid for his life,&quot; the missionary said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross have made inquiries both in eastern Zaire and in Rwanda but without result, he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An aide to the bishop of Goma, Monsignor Charles Maganya, is preparing a letter of protest to the rebel authorities who have controlled much of eastern Zaire since forcing out Zairean government forces in a rebellion six weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vatican has been informed of Nikwigize's disappearance. Nikwigize, who resigned his bishopric in 1994, spent two years in Goma carrying out confirmations among the more than a million refugees living in camps in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows the October 7 killing of four Spanish missionaries of the Marxist Order in Bukavu and the October 29 killing of the Roman Catholic archbishop of Bukavu, Monsignor Christopher Munzi Hirwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire has 17.32 million Roman Catholics among its 43.8 million people, according to 1992 and 1994 figures. Christianity has existed in the vast African nation since Belgian colonial days, which ended with independence in June 1960.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambia Independent Media Association (ZIMA) and the Press Association of Zambia (PAZA) have condemned the suspension of six journalists from the state owned-media over allegation of receiving bribes from the Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT).  The six were suspended on November 25 by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Laura Harrison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six suspended are Zambia Information Service (ZIS) deputy director Nalishebo Mundia, Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) commercial manager Abias Moyo, ZNBC sub-editor Gershom Musonda, Radio 2 manager Charles Banda, Kitwe-based ZNBC news editor Dominic Chimanyika and ZNBC-Television personality Chibamba Kanyama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to ZIMA, the suspensions follow allegations made on November 24, by former ZIMT vice-president, Alfred Zulu, to &quot;project a positive image of the organization (ZIMT) and to promote the ideals of the opposition.&quot; Zimba alleged that the journalists had been appointed to the ZIMT board and were paid K200,000 (about US$170.00) a month to sit on it. But Zulu told ZIMA that only Gershom Musonda, Charles Banda and another ZNBC reporter, Rosemary Konkola, were members of his board. Zulu denied the other journalists were members of his board. None of the suspended journalists served as election monitors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMT was among three independent monitors of the Zambia's November 18 presidential and parliamentary elections which declared the elections as 'not free and fair'. President Frederick Chiluba's Multiparty Movement Bright Mwape, ZIMA vice-chairman, stated &quot;the suspension of government media journalists is harsh, premature and an affront to press freedom and democracy&quot; . Mwape reportedly said that while ZIMA may not be in a position to comment on the merits of the case before concluding its own investigations, &quot;it believed the rules of natural justice have been violated by the government's failure to lend the journalists initial opportunity to reply to the allegations made against them by a well-known discredited person - Isaac Zimba&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAZA president, Ridgeway Liwena, The Post reports, charged in a press statement released in Lusaka on November 26 that &quot;there was an element of injustice&quot; in the manner Harrison handled the matter. &quot;PAZA has learnt with surprise of the suspension of six journalists at Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) and Zambia Information Services (ZIS) by the permanent secretary. We view the action as unfortunate in that it came from the highest authority. This denies the accused journalists an opportunity to appeal to the same ministry for arbitration,&quot; the statement asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMA further reports that Zambia's Electoral Commission chairman, Bobby Bwalya, threatened to order the arrest of a Post newspaper reporter for making inquiries about the November 18 election results. The Post reporter, Kunda Mwila, was threatened at the Electoral Commission's office on November 26. ZIMA says the reporter was inquiring on why election results from some polling stations had arrived a week late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMA reports that Bwaly, who had earlier refused to answer the reporter's questions in his office, &quot;got emotional&quot; when he later found reporter Mwila talking to the acting director of elections, Joel Sikazwe. Bwalya ordered Sikazwe not to entertain any questions from the reporter and &quot;personally barred the reporter from entering Sikazwe's office, slammed the door in the reporter's face and warned that should he persist he would order police to have him arrested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMA chairperson, David Simpson, said that the report of Bwalya's threats against Mwila were &quot;saddening&quot;. &quot;It is saddening to see persons of the status of electoral commission chairperson, Judge Bobby Bwalya, not only refusing to answer legitimate press queries but also threatening to have the pressman arrested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of attacks on journalists in Zambia have earned international scorn as a letter from the Canadian Committee to Protect Journalists indicates. The letter, dated December 3 and addressed to Zambian president H.E. Fredrick Chiluba, views the ongoing legal cases as &quot;contradictory to press freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter further states, &quot;We fear these actions mark the start of renewed clampdown on critics of the government in Zambia; therefore we urge you to encourage freedom of expression and the independence of the press, since they are essential to democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Events of &quot;persecution&quot; against The Post newspaper throughout 1996,as well as a listing of the recent suspension and harassment of reporters, are detailed in the body of the letter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kampala - There is an alarming surge in HIV infection among teenage boys and girls in Kenya and Uganda, it was revealed as part of the activities to mark International AIDS Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda's Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier Moses Ali told World AIDS Day participants (December 1) in the south-western Uganda town of Kabale that the rate of HIV infection is rising faster among adolescents than among adults.  Fifty five per cent of the estimated 1.5 million people infected with HIV in Uganda are under age 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brig. Ali told participants that as a consequence life expectancy in Uganda will by the year 2000 drop to 31-35 years due to the AIDS pandemic, down from 35-40 at present. Uganda's current life expectancy is already among the lowest in the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ali urged religious organizations in Uganda to subject individuals who claim &quot;healing by faith&quot; to scientific scrutiny to avoid exploitation by charlatans posing as faith healers. A number of controversial Ugandan preachers have claimed success in healing AIDS by the power of prayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retired Anglican Bishop Misaeri Kauma, the Chairman of Uganda's AIDS Commission, pointed out that there were already 1.5 million AIDS orphans in Uganda. He wanted Uganda communities to sustain the traditional collective approach to help these children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In neighbouring Kenya a disturbing study by two researchers indicates that adult AIDS victims believe that engaging in sex with minors confers healing to the affected individual, i.e. that it is a rejuvenating process. The study covered the worst HIV hit areas of Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study conducted by Michael Mbito and Steven Thuku of the Centre for Adolescent Health (CAH), which focuses on creating awareness of health physical/mental issues among teenagers, revealed that many women with AIDS establish sexual affairs with minors in the belief that their condition would be alleviated. Males who are carrying AIDS, believing similarly, also establish relations with young girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAH will hold a youth camp at St. Andrews Church, Nairobi, between 16-21 December at which youths will be enlightened on the impact of HIV/AIDS and its rapid spread in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile in South Africa retired Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu used the occasion of AIDS Day to urge South Africans to use the condom if they cannot stick to Christian teachings on sex. He appeared in an advertisement on state television as part of AIDS Day activities in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We in South Africa believe that sex should take place only in marriage.&quot; However, I want to urge all those who choose to have sex outside marriage to take the right precautions and practice safer sex. Please use a condom,&quot; said the retired prelate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Tutu's concern is motivated by recent South African statistics showing that nearly 4.5 per cent of the nation's population of 40 million is infected with HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in Liberia, the deadly disease is also on the increase. 150 cases and 43 deaths have been reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to journalists in Monrovia on a pro-World AIDS Day briefing November 28, the programme manager of the National AIDS and STD Central Programme (NACP) Dr. Isabella Simbeyo explained that this number does not represent the total number of persons infected throughout the country. He said the NACP has not been able to reach the entire country because of the civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On plans to help control the spread of the disease, Dr. Simbeyo said &quot;the NACP embarked upon a five-day community awareness campaign.&quot; The first area, he said, was in Clara Town on the Bushrad Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Simbeyo however lamented the government's inability to support the NACP.  &quot;The government is responsible to support this programme, but due to what is happening now in Liberia, where there is no money, the NACP is not fully supported,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Simbeyo said there are plans for the NACP to go full blast as there are signs that the programme may receive some help from international Non- Governmental Organizations (NGOs).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freetown - Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and rebel leader Foday Sankoh signed a long-awaited peace accord here November 30, ending more than five years of civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal paved the way for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the demobilisation and disarmament of Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front (RUF), and its integration into the national army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the terms of the treaty, the RUF -- at war with successive Sierra Leonean governments since 1991 -- will also become a legitimate political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both men and other parties in the peace process warned that the accord alone was not enough to end the crisis in Sierra Leone, one of the poorest countries in the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The challenge facing us now is how best to address ourselves to good leadership, governance and democracy,&quot; said Sankoh, whose Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has battled successive governments in Freetown since 1991.  &quot;If leadership fails, the people will take up arms again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sankoh and other senior members of the RUF had attempted to make last- minute changes to the deal in talks with Ivory Coast, whose government had been attempting to broker an end to the conflict since February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, RUF demands for the immediate withdrawal from Sierra Leone of foreign troops helping the army -- especially a South African mercenary unit - - were rejected, ministry sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the document, which both Kabbah and Sankoh undertook to sign in a joint statement released earlier this month, would call for the departure of the mercenaries without specifying a withdrawal date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until February 1996, when an RUF delegation met representatives of Sierra Leone's defunct military junta in Abidjan, the rebels said they would not approach the negotiating table unless all foreign troops were expelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, by which time the junta had ceded power to Kabbah's elected regime, the question of foreign troops was one of two points in a detailed accord on which both parties failed to agree, and negotiations were suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second point was the RUF's insistence that a national budgetary and debt committee be set up to evaluate and deal with Sierra Leone's debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accord will meet this demand in principle, but will not include specific undertakings, the Ivory Coast foreign ministry sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the RUF maintains it is not a &quot;spent force,&quot; observers believe the rebels no longer enjoy their former military strength and that their bargaining power has accordingly diminished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A ceasefire has supposedly been in place since the early stages of the peace talks, but military authorities in Freetown have claimed considerable victories over the rebels in the last few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these victories were achieved with the help of local militia groups, made up of traditional hunters known as Kamojor, the authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, Kabbah warned he would use the &quot;military option&quot; if the rebels failed to lay down their arms by December 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the peace accord, signed at 4:00 p.m. (1600 GMT) in the Ivorian capital, was greeted with widespread jubilation in Freetown itself, where people danced and cheered, cars and ships honked their horns and church bells rang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The war is over. We have peace at last,&quot; shouted revellers. The scene in Abidjan was more sober, though the two erstwhile enemies did embrace each other during the signing ceremony, and praised the accord as a new beginning for the impoverished west African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A tortuous period for the people of Sierra Leone has come to an end. In effect, the war has ended,&quot; said Kabbah of the pact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pact is &quot;the dawn of a new era for Sierra Leone, an era of democracy, accountability and performance,&quot; said Sankoh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the RUF took up arms against the government, more than 10,000 people in Sierra Leone have died and around one million have been displaced from their homes. An already poor economy has been ruined by damage to industry and agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivory Coast President Henri Konan Bedie, whose government hosted and mediated the peace process initiated in February, said the signing was &quot;an historical event.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he added the accord was a &quot;framework which will not solve all problems.  Its effective implementation requires much effort and patience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day before the ceremony, Sankoh had told journalists in his villa in Abidjan, where he has been staying since peace talks began in February, that it was imperative for both parties to sign, to come together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am signing in the interests of the people of Sierra Leone,&quot; said Sankoh, barefoot and wearing loose blue robes and a light, greying beard. &quot;The government is not forcing me to sign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sankoh returned on Wednesday from his jungle bases in Sierra Leone, where he had spent five days discussing the peace process with his fighters. The trip was &quot;more or less successful. The boys' morale is high,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the reported capture of RUF bases in the extreme east, near the Liberian border, Sankoh accused the army of violating a ceasefire agreed upon in the early stages of the peace process and reiterated in a joint communique signed a week ago by Kabbah and Sankoh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On their way to Kailahun 300 kilometers east of Freetown some fighters were attacked. They had to cross into Liberia instead of surrendering to the enemy. They would never surrender,&quot; said Sankoh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel leader accused government forces of staging attacks on RUF positions while he was in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kabbah has no control even of government forces,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;but there is no need for us to complain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is he ready for peace?&quot; Sankoh asked, or just for &quot;the donors and investment&quot; that peace will bring?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of the rebellion he launched in 1991, since when more than 10,000 people have died, he said he took up arms &quot;to show our concern for the people, because the system was using violence against the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peaceful protests, such as strikes and demonstrations, failed to achieve democracy and &quot;there was no alternative&quot; to fighting, as &quot;the armed struggle is a legitimate part of democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as Bedie, ambassadors to Ivory Coast from the United States, Great Britain and France, representatives of the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the Commonwealth and several non- governmental organizations, the chairman of the African Development Bank, as well as a host of senior Ivory Coast military officers and ministers, attended the signing ceremony.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salvador, Brazil - The grey sea foamed against the dock at Solar do Unhao Saturday, just as it did for over 300 years during which 6 to 12 million African men and women arrived in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, brought in ships to begin a life of slavery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solar do Unhao (Mansion of Unhao -- the name of the slave trader whose home still remains) was the site of morning worship (30 November) on the seventh day of the World Council of Churches' Conference held in Salvador, Brazil November 24 - December 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 400 members of the conference went to the historic slave dock in a convoy of buses, a mini-bus and six taxis. The delegates were clearly moved as they walked in a guided meditation from the dock where the slave ships landed, to a nearby white stucco shed where historians believe men and women were classified by age, size and relative health.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In silence, men and women from around the globe made their way to a small church behind the dock where water was thrown on the slaves -- a collective &quot; baptism&quot; of human beings who were considered a cargo by their captors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the delegates gathered at the front of the dock, facing the surging Atlantic in the direction of the distant African coast, they sang &quot;Deep River, &quot; an African-American spiritual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came a prayer of confession. &quot;When others are cast down, and enslaved, made of no account for the menial labour they produce for the benefit of their masters, we watch from afar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Aaron Tolen (Cameroon Presbyterian Church), one of eight presidents of the WCC, reminded the worshipers that there was abundant guilt in the years of the slave trade, which began before 1492 when Portuguese merchants and seafarers kidnapped Africans to be used as slaves in Portugal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dear African brothers and sisters, we have heard words of repentance,&quot; Tolen said. &quot;But those who brought us here were not alone in the making of this tragedy. We Africans share in the responsibility. We have degraded ourselves by selling our brothers and sisters as goods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Dr. Janice Nessibou of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana stood beside Elizabeth Sele Mulbah (Province of West Africa, Liberia) as she lifted a time-worn orange brick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This stone, that we have brought from Ghana, is a stone of tears,&quot; Nessibou explained. The brick was from the outer wall of a slave fort, Cape Coast Castle, in Ghana, where slaves were loaded for their long voyage to South America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a project under the guise of restoration, the fort was destroyed,&quot; she said. &quot;A local chief collected the stones and he called them 'stones of tears.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the chief heard that the WCC was to hold a meeting in Salvador, &quot;he sent this stone to be presented to the Afro-Brazilian community,&quot; Nessibou said. &quot;Words cannot express what this stone means to our very souls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brick was accepted by Enilson Souza Rocha, general director of Ecumenical Coordination of Services (CESE) in Salvador. Rocha and the two women embraced one another with evident emotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Joseph A. Kwame Labi (Patriarchate of Alexandria) led the worshipers in an act of cleansing. Large bowls of water were placed at the front of the worship space and people lined up to dip their hands and wash their faces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are invited to wash your hands in fresh water as a sign of healing, reconciliation and hope,&quot; Labi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they came to the water bowls, delegates sang &quot;Ewelina mandla,&quot; a Xhosa hymn from South Africa, and &quot;O Healing River,&quot; an African- American spiritual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the words of absolution were said, the delegates received red, green and yellow ribbons which they tied around one another's wrists as a sign of &quot; enduring friendship&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young drummers of Olodum, a troupe of former Brazilian street children brought the service to a dramatic end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Softly, the drum beat began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What sound is this?&quot; asked Father Labi. The drums increased in volume as he answered, &quot;This is the sound of a culture that refused to die. It is the resistance of those building a new community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates swayed and moved to the beat as the drums thundered in the courtyard. Others made their way to the edge of the dock and stood silently.  As they gazed at the distant ocean horizon, their eyes brimmed with tears.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salvador, Brazil - Some 600 Christians from more than 80 nations gathered in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil on November 24 to December 3 to examine their cultural distinctions and learn more about how cultures have influenced a wide range of insights into the one gospel of Jesus Christ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Conference on World Mission and Evangelism, sponsored by the World Council of Churches (WCC), opened with worship Sunday night (24 November) in a canopied area overlooking the humid Atlantic shore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of delegates, whose clothing ranged from simple shirts and blouses to richly ornamented national garments, raised their voices lustily in order to be heard over a roaring thunderstorm as they sang the closing hymn, &quot;Jesus Christ the Joy of the World.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The service was interrupted by a peaceful demonstration by Brazilian Methodists who displayed a banner decrying alleged sexism in their church.  The protest took place in front of Methodist Bishop Paulo Ayres Mattos as he stood to deliver his sermon. Many of the delegates appeared not to know what was happening as a woman shouted denunciations of the bishop until her microphone was unplugged.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enilson Soza Silva, general secretary of the Ecumenical Commission of Service in Brazil, apologized to Mattos for the interruption. &quot;This is truly a country of contrasts,&quot; he told the delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mattos declined to continue his sermon. &quot;May God bless this conference,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope that anything we do and anything we say has to do with the real capacity of the church to live in diversity and accept differences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference is the 11th in a series of world mission encounters that began in 1910 in Edinburgh, Scotland. The last conference was held in San Antonio, Texas (USA) in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the conference theme, &quot;Called to One Hope - the Gospel in Diverse Cultures,&quot; delegates will consider the results of an extensive worldwide five- year study examining the ways cultures and the gospel have influenced each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a first press briefing, the Rev. Ana Langerak (Lutheran Church in Costa Rica), director of the WCC Unit that is organizing the conference, said the meeting site was carefully chosen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brazilian state of Bahia has the second largest population of African blacks of any nation and Christians there live amid a vast array of cultures, she said. &quot;Salvador is a microcosm of (the world's) diversity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bahia Christians include Roman Catholics, pentecostals, evangelicals, Protestants and Candomble, an indigenous Afro- Brazilian religion which some critics complain is a syncretistic combination of Christianity and spirit worship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Around the world we still experience the cultural alienation of Christians, &quot; said the Rev. Christopher Duraisingh, (Church of South India) as he led the gospel and cultures study. Some falsely claimed, &quot;in the name of the Gospel, apartheid could be defended. In the name of the Gospel, the (low) status of women could be defended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Xenophobia is rampant (and) the churches are no exception here,&quot; he added.  But the main thrust of the conference, Duraisingh said, will be &quot;the renewal of churches in mission and what that means for a local congregation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a conference in which a few charismatic leaders speak and everyone takes notes and goes on,&quot; Duraisingh pointed out. &quot;It's a conference that intentionally will want to listen to people on the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True to this promise, the following two days were filled with nearly 30 &quot; uncontros&quot; (meetings) designed to expose delegates to the many ways in which cultures are reflecting the gospel of Jesus Christ around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alienated youth culture of Germany, competition with Muslim evangelists in Africa, the television culture of the United States and the increased visibility of the Sami people of the Nordic countries ...all these issues and more were raised in the encontros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exhibits showcasing the sites and colours of 28 national churches were also featured in a &quot;Rainbow&quot; festival of gospel and cultures running parallel to the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The churches in Africa face a variety of challenges but most of them are open to leadership by young adults and women, according to Dr. Setri Nyomi of the All Africa Conference of Churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyomi said Christians are trying to avoid direct confrontations with Islamic evangelists who are increasingly active in Africa. &quot;Our approach is to talk together and diminish the importance of competition,&quot; he said. &quot;In talking together, we come to understand each other better and discover ways of working together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christians and Muslims are both winning converts among the indigenous religions of Africa, Nyomi said at the African encontro. In the meantime, Christianity continues to grow on the continent. Christians in Ethiopia are 40-million strong, reported Dimetros Woldu (Ethiopian Orthodox Church).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encontros from Germany, UK, Cuba, Nordic countries and the US, among others, brought many issues of culture and religion to the attention of the delegates. Three specialized issue-centred encontros exposed delegates to cultural issues of indigenous peoples, youth and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tables and booths in the Rainbow Festival displayed traditional clothing, vestments, artifacts and literature from churches around the globe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - WFP and UNHCR report that some 15,000 refugees have left the Kagenyi and Rubwere camps in the Karagwe region. According to some reports, they are said to be heading north and east. The exodus took place between Friday and Sunday night, and more people were reported to be on the road today although heavy rains appear to have temporarily stalled the refugee movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some media accounts say aid workers have put forward the theory that Hutu hardliners may be organising mass departures in response to the repatriation preparations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 300 Rwandan refugees returned home from Tanzania on Sunday and many more were expected to follow on Tuesday, according to UNHCR, quoted by AFP.  Earlier, UNHCR announced the return of about 1,118 refugees on Friday. It said a mass return was expected tomorrow after the food rations were distributed to refugees today. A UNHCR update, issued on Friday, said preparations for the return included setting up two way stations on the 30km road from the camps to the border and four water points, which would also be used as a collection point for children separated from their parents. WFP said it was distributing food to refugees in the greater Benaco and Ngara camps. The rations, consisting of cereals, pulses and vegetable oil, will be distributed to camps in the Karagwe region later in the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan radio said a planned operation to repatriate some 1,000 refugees from Tanzania on Saturday was scrapped. Rwandan military and civilian officials who went to the border to welcome the returnees were told the operation had been cancelled, but no reasons were given. The radio also reported that 163 Rwandan refugees arrived back in Kigali from Brazzaville, Congo, on Friday. It said 800 Rwandans had fled to the Congolese capital from Kinshasa last month after being &quot;harassed and tortured&quot; following events in eastern Zaire. More returnees were expected in the coming days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the refugee influx from Zaire and Burundi in Tanzania's Kigoma region has slowed down, UNHCR reported. In its Friday update, it said that over the last five days 5,200 refugees had arrived from Burundi and 550 had come by boat from Zaire. Some 100,000 refugees have arrived in Kigoma since last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools were due to reopen in the south Kivu area of eastern Zaire today after the regional authorities held a meeting last week to discuss the issue.  Municipal and educational authorites would visit educational establishments in the course of the day to learn more about the situation, rebel Radio of the People announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent visitors to Zairean President Mobutu say his health is deteriorating and doubt whether he will ever return home, Associated Press reported yesterday. The news agency said it had been told privately by Mobutu's chief aide, Bosco Kassoubia, that the president &quot;is very sick ... and he is very tired. He is incapable of having more than one visit a day.&quot; On Saturday, Kassoubia announced that all photo opportunities of the president would cease.  Mobutu, who has not been in Zaire since August, is convalescing from cancer surgery at his villa in the south of France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report in the Washington Post said State Department officials believed Mobutu was negotiating with the South African Executive Outcomes security firm to supply mercenaries to put down the eastern Zaire rebellion. Rumours have been circulating of mercenary involvement on the side of the Zairean army. According to South African radio, French newspapers reported last week that 300 mercenaries were fighting alongside the Zaireans. However Executive Outcomes has denied the allegations. The radio reported the firm's owner as saying he had been approached to help in the Great Lakes region, but had declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette reiterated the call for an international conference on the Great Lakes region. In an interview with Radio France Internationale on Friday, he stated that Zaire's territorial integrity was a prerequisite for regional peace. He said a &quot;latent civil war&quot; was taking root in Zaire, with increasing political problems, and a conference should be convened as soon as possible, under UN and OAU auspices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of Red Cross groups from the five Great Lakes countries were due to meet in Nairobi today to discuss the humanitarian crisis in the region. The two-day meeting, comprising representatives of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies from Burundi, Rwanda, Zaire, Tanzania and Uganda, will focus on strategic planning in the area, AFP said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan justice minister Faustin Nteziryayo met the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Jose Ayala Lasso, on Saturday to discuss the human rights situation in the country following the mass return of Rwandan refugees. A report on Rwandan radio said the minister briefed Ayala Lasso on measures taken by Rwanda to improve human rights conditions, especially in the country's prisons. Steps taken included the temporary release of minor offenders and setting up committees to examine the cases of detainees. He also explained that &quot;advanced preparations&quot; were underway regarding the trials of genocide suspects. Official Rwandan sources, quoted by AFP today, said the names of 1,900 genocide suspects had been published, listed by commune and prefecture. They are suspected of &quot;first degree&quot; involvement in the 1994 genocide, which renders them liable to the death penalty under a new law introduced in September.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Lt-Gen Maurice Baril, Canadian commander of the multi-national force has said the situation in eastern Zaire is improving. &quot;Life is returning to normal, the markets are open and people are coming home,&quot; said Baril, who arrived in Goma on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any force sent to the region must have &quot;a mission to accomplish&quot;, he added, hinting there may no longer be any need for sending foreign troops. While in Goma, Baril said he had not seen any movement of refugees during his visit, but acknowledged some were further west in the Zairean forest without aid. &quot; The groups have broken up,&quot; he said. &quot;It is difficult to know exactly where they are.&quot; He indicated that food-drops were now probably out of the question, describing them as &quot;costly and dangerous&quot;. However, &quot;if there were to be a catastrophe, we could do food-drops,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France insisted it was still committed to an international force, despite remarks at the weekend by Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain in which he said there was &quot;no longer any question of going there (eastern Zaire).&quot; The French foreign ministry later issued a commnique stating that &quot;France's position on the implementation of United Nations resolutions on Zaire, notably on the deployment of a multi-national force, has not changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with Kenya's Sunday Standard newspaper, rebel commander Andre Ngandu Kissasse said his troops &quot;had the weapons and the people's will to fight a war. We will reach Kinshasa very soon.&quot; He said some Zairean soldiers had joined the rebels, and others were so disillusioned without pay that they were no longer capable of fighting. Rebel leader Laurent Kabila meanwhile, who paid a short visit to Bukavu on Friday, told recruits in the area it was time to carry out the liberation struggle, rebel Radio of the People reported on Saturday. He defined their mission as &quot;a disciplined army at the service of the people ... an elite body different from an outlawed armed gang.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR spokesman Filippo Grandi told AFP on Saturday that there have been 2, 754 corpses picked up and buried in the Goma region between November 2 and December 4. He said his figures were based on data from a local humanitarian agency working for UNHCR with responsibility for burying bodies. He added it was not known who killed them but that some had died of exhaustion or illness.  Half of the bodies were thought to be refugees, and the rest Zaireans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan security sources, quoted by AFP on Saturday, said at least 3,000 Zairean soldiers had joined up with Ugandan rebels based in Zaire. According to the sources, the soldiers - who had been driven out of Beni by Zairean rebels - believed the Ugandan army had helped the rebels take control of Beni, and they were now siding with the rebel Ugandan Allied Democratic Forces (ADF). Uganda has consistently denied any involvement in the Beni takeover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International has expressed concern that Rwandan refugees in Tanzania will be returned home without consideration for their rights to continue to seek asylum. In a statement dated 6 December, Amnesty &quot;appeals for an immediate withdrawal of the decision by the Tanzanian government to expel all Rwandese refugees by 31 December 1996 and is urging the UNHCR to desist from taking any actions which would condone this decision&quot;. Saying that the refugees are &quot;not just an anonymous mass&quot;, the human rights organization says many of them &quot;would be at risk on return,&quot; due to continuing human rights problems within Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report from the UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda released on 7 December indicates that 162 returnees have so far been placed in detention from over 500,000 who returned from Zaire during November. The UNHRFOR says that 322,964 people had been registered in their home communes as of 1 December, and that &quot;returnees were generally well-received&quot;. Some of those in detention are seeking protection from revenge attacks. In general, the report says local authorities have respected national directives so that arrests take place only after case files have been completed. 4,331 members of the former Rwandan Armed Forces (ex-FAR) have been registered, 12 of whom have been arrested. HRFOR have received reports of 26 returnees being ill-treated at the time of their arrest or during detention and are investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four returnees and two of their associates have been killed, according to HRFOR, but also four genocide survivors and two of their associates have been reported killed by returnees, apparently in an attempt to eliminate witnesses to crimes committed in 1994. HRFOR reports that property problems could be the largest impediment to rapid reintegration. The lack of housing - particularly in urban areas remains a &quot;real and serious&quot; problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its report, the HRFOR reported on the reception of 75,000 Rwandan returnees who came from Burundi in July and August. Of those, about 2.65% are in detention presently.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. EASTERN ZAIRE - information as of 6 December</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Although UN agencies, including WFP, now have a presence in the towns of Goma and Bukavu, access to the surrounding areas is limited. On 3 December, humanitarian staff were finally able to reach Uvira from Bukavu. This represents the first visit that UN agencies, including WFP, were able to carry out to the Uvira area since their evacuation in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 The UN/NGO team that visited Uvira on 3 December met with the de facto authorities and were able to visit the town. While some WFP local staff were still in place, the WFP Office had been completely looted, as had the temporary warehouses. Access to the port was denied; however, the two cranes were reported to be more or less intact. Uvira town was reported to be very calm: markets had re-opened and were reasonably well supplied. Commercial traffic on the escarpment road was reported to be normal. No refugees were seen on the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Following reports of some 40-50,000 refugees moving from the Minova area (17 km south of Sake on the road between Goma and Bukavu) towards Goma, a UNHCR/WFP mission tried to visit the Sake/Minova area on 28 November, accompanied by Lieutenant General Baril, head of the multi-national force, but was forced to turn back to Goma when bursts of gunfire were heard on the road close to Sake. Agencies were denied access to Minova on 29 November.  Distribution of WFP high-energy biscuits to returning refugees at other road- side way stations located at Sake, Mugunga, and Kulungu, which started on 29 November, continued throughout the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 WFP has been waiting for authorisation from the Zairian authorities to conduct an airlift directly to Kisangani from Entebbe. So far, clearance has been given only to fly via Kinshasa, an unfeasible route given the vast distances involved. 95 metric tons of WFP food remain on standby at Entebbe airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 WFP staff in Kisangani report that the security situation is unstable.  A number of agencies have recently evacuated or reduced the number of their international staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 WFP food reserves in Burundi continue to be depleted as distributions outstrip imports. Meanwhile, WFP is pursuing all possible solutions to the problem of moving food and fuel to Bujumbura on Lake Tanganyika from Kigoma, Tanzania. Only by opening up this route will WFP be able to deliver the 2,500 metric tons authorised by the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee, which is needed to feed the growing number of internally displaced persons and returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 Most Burundians who have fled to Tanzania since the beginning of November originated in the central and eastern provinces of Gitega, Rutana and Ruyigi. A WFP mission to that area during the week found continued tension, with several communes almost deserted. Burundian refugees in Tanzania now number some 190,000, larger than the Burundian population of the Uvira camps before the Eastern Zaire crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 During November, according to UNHCR figures cited in a DHA report, a total of 59,000 returnees crossed to Burundi from Eastern Zaire. This included 15,377 who passed through the Gatumba transit camp and approximately 44,000 who went directly to Citiboke province from Zaire. The WFP Burundi Country Director joined a UN evaluation mission to Cibitoke, and found that large numbers of returnees continue to arrive in Cibitoke and are camped along the main north-south road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.4 Insecurity continued to affect much of the country during the past week.  In addition to the on-going insecurity in Rutana, Ruyigi and Cankuzo provinces, the WFP sub-office in Ngozi reported that problems continue in Kayanza and Muramvya provinces and in the north of Gitega province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.5 WFP Burundi caseload totalled 135,997 last week, of which 73,119 were beneficiaries of emergency relief distributions. A total of 24,765 people benefited from the WFP returnee package from 25 November to 1 December, 3,444 spontaneous returnees in Cibitoke province and 1,269 returnees at the Gatumba transit site (Bujumbura Rural province).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.6 WFP organised a flight by a C-130 Hercules transport plane carrying 15 metric tons of medicines for Action Contre la Faim to Bujumbura from Nairobi.  This quantity is in addition to the 52 metric tons of medicines carried by WFP trucks from Tanzania for various humanitarian agencies since the beginning of November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 The general security situation in Rwanda is calm and stable. However some incidents were reported at commune level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 More than 550,000 refugees are estimated to have returned to Rwanda from 15 to 30 November. Registration by local authorities currently in process to determine exact numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 Some 28,000 returnees came back to Rwanda from Zaire during the week of 27 November to 2 December, 24,000 via Gisenyi, 3,500 via Cyangugu and 500 via Kibungo. Further arrivals from Zaire are expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.4 Distributions are currently on-going in all prefectures of Rwanda. They are generally implemented at the commune level, with the exception of Umutara, Kibungo, Butare, Gikongoro and Cyangugu where, due to low repatriation, the returnees receive assistance in transit centres at the prefecture level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.5 From 16 November, when distributions of food aid to returnees started, until 6 December, WFP and NGO partners distributed approximately 6,170 metric tons, which represents a total of 1,600,000 weekly rations or 380,000 monthly rations. In most communes monthly rations are provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.6 The number of Zairian and Burundian refugees in Cyangugu prefecture has decreased due to repatriation. Currently, there are 400 Zairians (from Uvira) and 2,600 Burundians (from Cibitoke) in Cyangugu camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.7 A total of 2,212 metric tons of food are pre-positioned for the returnee programme (equivalent to 571,071 weekly rations). The overall WFP stock position in the country stands at 7,805 metric tons (equivalent to 1, 570,000 weekly rations). Deliveries from WFP regional stocks to Rwanda are being stepped up to cover the increased distribution needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.8 WFP is taking necessary measures to prepare for the arrival of returnees from Tanzania. Prefectures which are expected to receive the most returnees are Kibungo, Byumba and Butare. Food is being pre-positioned at commune level with the assistance of NGOs. WFP staffing is being strengthened and logistical capacity augmented in these prefectures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.9 Stocks of biscuits are also in place in areas expected to receive further returnees. Stock levels presently stand at 364 metric tons with 54 metric tons due to arrive shortly. The total is equivalent to 1,671,264 daily rations. Way-stations have been identified for distribution alongside the roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.10 The WFP short-haul trucking fleet operating in Rwanda now numbers 39 trucks (7 x 7 metric tons capacity and 32 x 15 metric tons capacity). An additional 16 trucks (15 metric tons capacity) are expected to arrive in the coming days. WFP is currently looking into possibilities of increasing its short- haul fleet further due to the expected arrival of returnees from Tanzania. These trucks are used country-wide to assist in the food distributions at the commune level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.11 In order to facilitate the reintegration of returnees, the WFP Country Office is planning a massive expansion of food-for-work activities in Rwanda.  Within a month an increase of up to 30 per cent is anticipated in some areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.12 Food prices at local markets have risen in several areas of Rwanda.  Some increases are due to crop failures and some to increased population because of massive repatriation. Further information on this issue will be available following the joint FAO/WFP crop and food supply assessment mission which started on 2 December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 A joint statement has been released by UNHCR and the Government of Tanzania confirming that all Rwandan refugees in Tanzania are to return home by 31 December 1996. The message, addressed to all Rwandan refugees in the country, states that the United Republic of Tanzania has decided that all Rwandan refugees can now return to their country in safety. The Tanzanian Ministry of Home Affairs will coordinate the repatriation operations, assisted by the Tanzanian police force and, where necessary, the army. The Government of Tanzania has given its assurance that the repatriation process will be carried out in an orderly and humane manner. Tanzania hosts some 530, 000 Rwandan refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 Influxes continue on a large scale into Tanzania's Kigoma region.  Kigoma has witnessed the arrival of approximately 102,000 new refugees since 1 November, bringing the overall population to 146,682 (approximately 116,000 Burundian refugees, 27,000 Zairians and 3,600 Rwandans). Influxes in the past few days have been predominantly from Burundi, where ethnic conflict is forcing increasing numbers to flee their homes. Burundian refugees arriving in Tanzania are in a poor nutritional state and WFP has despatched additional quantities of blended food to the region in order to increase supplementary feeding programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. LIBERIA AND SIERRA LEONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. LIBERIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 In the period 22 November-4 December, a total of 3,144 soldiers were demobilised. The total included 845 boys, two girls and 44 women. WFP has distributed over 75 mt food commodities to disarmed soldiers at the 8 operational demobilisation sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Demobilisation activities began on 1 December in Voinjama. Hundreds of displaced persons and Liberian refugees from Guinea have returned to Voinjama following the deployment of ECOMOG troops in the area at the end of November.  Demobilisation has not yet started in Bo-Waterside or Greenville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 The UN Security Council has extended UNOMIL (United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia) until 31 March 1997. UNOMIL has been working closely with ECOMOG and the international humanitarian community during the demobilisation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 The Greenville-Zwedru highway was opened last week by ECOMOG, enabling the safe travel of soldiers to Greenville for demobilisation. Demobilisation at Zwedru (Grand Gedah County) has been slow with only 79 fighters disarmed.  Fighters have apparently requested a briefing on demobilisation by faction leader George Boley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 ECOMOG troops have been deployed to Tapeta, Nimba County. Troop presence is expected to create a buffer zone between National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and Liberian Peace Council (LPC) factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.6 WFP November distribution to 244,079 displaced persons in 36 shelters throughout the country is scheduled to be complete on 6 December. As part of an effort to improve sanitary conditions of internally displaced person shelters in Monrovia, WFP is supporting Red Cross and UNICEF projects, including latrine construction, though food-for-work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.7 WFP, through implementing partner CCC, is also supporting a food-for- work environment clean-up project in Tubmanburg. The project, which will include women, ex-combatant and civilian participation, will create an employment-based safety net for vulnerable groups while improving sanitary conditions in the town through the removal of debris and litter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. SIERRA LEONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 President Ahmed Kabbah and Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel leader Foday Sankoh signed a peace accord on 30 November in Abidjan. The agreement follows five years of civil war which have resulted in some 10,000 deaths. A commission for the consolidation of peace, made up of the Government of Sierra Leone and RUF members, is coordinating the details of the peace process in Abidjan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 Mechanisms are in place for the commencement of WFP resettlement and rehabilitation programmes throughout Sierra Leone by 1 January 1997. WFP will complete the last general food distributions by the end of December, which will then be replaced by targeted feeding programmes (resettlement and vulnerable group feeding). Surveys are on-going at each internally displaced persons site to identify food aid needs among vulnerable households.  Resettlement assistance is being coordinated, and plans to expand NGO activity in rural areas in support of resettlement are being discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 WFP, through implementing partners World Vision and CCSL, has distributed return packages to more than 25,000 returnees in Pujehun district.  Last week more than 8,000 former RUF captives were released in this district, on the orders of RUF leader Sankoh prior to the signing of the peace accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.4 Kenema, Makeni, Bo and Mile 38 have been identified as assembly points for the disarmament and demobilisation of RUF combatants. The Government has signed accords with Africare (Kenema), ARD (Makeni), Evangelist Fellowship of Sierra Leone (Mile 38), and CRS (Bo) to assist in the reintegration of demobilised soldiers. A total of 2,000 soldiers are expected to be hosted in each of the camps, for a total caseload of 8,000. WFP is finalising its demobilisation plan in coordination with the Government's demobilisation programme, which was released at the end of November in Freetown. The cost of the Government demobilisation programme is estimated at USD 35 million.  Funding received towards the project to date amounts to USD 1.5 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. ANGOLA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Demobilisation of under-aged soldiers continues at a slow pace. Through 2 December, 629 under-aged soldiers from Vila Nova, N'Gove, Negage and Londuimbali Quartering Areas (QAs) were demobilised. Four additional QAs are expected to begin demobilisation on 10 December (Catala, Cahicuma, Andulo and Chitembo). It is hoped that demobilised soldiers from all eight QAs will be transported home before the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 A DHA Flash Appeal was issued in Angola on 21 November to cover the UN requirements for the demobilisation process until such time as all camps are emptied. WFP appeals to donors for 18,692 metric tons of food commodities to cover food requirements to Selection and Demobilisation Centres and QAs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 WFP has made a further appeal to donors for 96,033 metric tons of food commodities required for the period March 1997 - February 1998 to continue assistance to 700,000 displaced and war-affected persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 A WFP-led mission to Likua and Jamba (Kuando Kubango) at the end of November found no immediate requirements for additional food aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 Results of a MSF-Spain and CARE nutritional survey in Quilengues (Huila) and a MSF-Spain survey in Uige both showed improved nutritional conditions among vulnerable populations in these areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.6 UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali on 19 November announced the withdrawal of four UNAVEM infantry and support units (600-700 persons) by the end of December 1996. UNAVEM is expected to withdraw all 7,000 troops from Angola by 8 February, when their mandate expires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.7 The overall security situation in Angola is reported as calm by the UNAVEM Huambo regional headquarters, however several ambushes throughout the country were reported at the end of November.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - As they grapple with a seemingly endless civil war, Liberians still living at home are facing another onslaught; this time from smart money transfer agencies which have taken advantage of the collapse of the banking system, including the National Bank of Liberia, closed in April after a rebel attack on Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was before the transitional government of Ruth Perry came to power.  Under the guise of helping Liberians to receive funds from relations abroad, some of the money changers whose outfits have mushroomed from just three to 12 immediately after the April attack, have resorted to fleecing their customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process begins with the money merchants opening accounts in the United States and Europe into which customers pay the money they are sending to their relations. The receipts are then faxed to Liberia. For this, the money changers make sundry deductions for fax and telephone expenses, service charges and commissions before paying what is left to the beneficiaries. The deductions take as much as 30 per cent of the sum sent. Even so, payment is not made in the usual currency but in the anemic Liberian dollar and at the prevailing exchange rate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few, if any, are lucky to collect what is left of the money in good time.  Often, the beneficiary would make series of fruitless trips to the offices of the money changers, only to be fed on different excuses on each occasion to explain away their inability to pay promptly. As a result, frustrated Liberians caught in the web have nicknamed the financial houses &quot;Go and come tomorrow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of a judicial system which equally collapsed in the April attack on Monrovia, the victims have resigned their fate to God. &quot;I've been waiting for my money for four months,&quot; laments one victim. &quot;My husband sent if from the USA to let me pay my way to Ghana and take the children. Now I'm still waiting for it.&quot; Another victim explained that his family in the USA sent him 1,500 US dollars to help him relocate but that he ended up receiving only 900 dollars, half of it paid in Liberia dollars. &quot;What can I do?&quot; he asked in resignation. &quot;At least it got me out of the war zone, only (for me) to go and start another financial war in Ivory Coast,&quot; he complained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the contrary, the finance companies see their activities as anything but a rip-off. To them, their business is patriotic and helpful to the people. &quot; We are only here to help,&quot; says the managing director of one of the companies.  &quot;If we had not surfaced, our people wouldn't have been able to get money to pay their way to safety. As for the high charges you complain about, we cannot help it. We have to pay our staff and the telecommunications company for fax and telephone use. We also have to service our accounts abroad and most of all, since we are not a charity organisation, we have to make profit to stay afloat. We are only doing legitimate business which is of utmost service to our people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He may have a point. At a worse level was the news that several people have died through suicide in Yaounde, Cameroun, following reports that the Banque Meridien BIAO Cameroun, BMBC had been shut down due to insolvency. An affiliate of a liquidated transnational bank, BMBC survived until three months ago because Camerounians, including the government, chose to continue doing business with it in the hope that the fortunes of the bank would change for the better. Even the minister of economy and finance, Justin Ndioro, felt that he could restructure the bank and avert its collapse. Ndioro and the government of Paul Biya only gave up after several vain efforts and withdrew the license of BMBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government had earlier sought to convince the public of its ability to save the ailing bank by undertaking a strong media campaign to allay customers' fears that the bank could go bust. Now the disappointed customers are calling for the head of the government for misleading them. Apart from deceiving depositors, the government is also being blamed for contributing to the bank's collapse, having borrowed heavily from it and failing to pay back.  In September last year, the ministry of finance had set up a commission to look into the state of affairs of BMBC, with an assurance that the bank would be given special attention through a package that was being worked out with the World Bank. And as late as July, the government released another statement, assuring customers that it was up to the task of saving the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all the plans failed when the government failed to pay its debt as agreed with the World Bank. In the event, the only option was liquidation of the bank. The morning after news of the liquidation was broadcast, depositors trooped to the bank to withdraw their money, only to meet all the doors shut.  Their hopes of getting succour from government were dashed when the appointed liquidator, Emmanuel Etoundi Oyono, told them to forget about their money, as the process of liquidation is very long and cumbersome.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - As the federal government begins preparation for the 1997 budget, the issue of privatisation has come to rivet the administration's attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, they came calling two weeks ago. They are the egg-heads from the World Bank team on privatisation. In recent times, the World Bank has been rendering advisory services to Nigeria on how to revamp the economy after its cousin, the International Monetary Fund, shunned direct dealings with Nigeria. The IMF says the World Bank should put all the structures in place without which the IMF, and the Paris club would not give a clean bill of health for Nigeria to be considered for debt relief measures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not surprising, therefore, that Abuja has taken the World Banks recommendations seriously; the merger of the dual exchange rate, the removal of a cap on interest rates, a high level of fiscal discipline, as well as transparency and accountability. Though the administration is willing, it seems unsure whether the wholesale privatisation, particularly of the upstream sector of the oil industry and appropriate pricing of petroleum products, was the right thing to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theweek learnt that when the World Bank team came two weeks ago, privatisation dominated discussions, with the proposals on the oil sector drawing some flak. Government sources say that while the administration has heartily endorsed the privatisation of the downstream sector, especially the refineries, government economic policy experts are divided over privatisation of the upstream sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group led by Anthony Ani, the finance minister, is canvassing the view of the World Bank that the upstream sector should be privatised for a more efficient management to make more money available to the government for development of the economy. The argument is that the government's joint venture/partnership with six multinational oil companies is fraught with counter-claims on expenditures and then rancour over the administration's apparent inability to pay cash calls promptly. Indeed, it was to eliminate the problems of cash calls that the government came out with another option, that of production sharing contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This option allows an oil company to carry all the risks of production without government investment. In turn, government receives only the petroleum profit tax and royalty. If the company fails to make an oil find, it bears all the losses. The Ani school of thought holds the view that there is no remarkable difference between profit sharing and privatisation. In privatisation, it argues that all the government need do is to monitor adequately the activities in that sector to ensure that the government is not short-changed in requisite payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a senior partner with 60 per cent equity, the government has had to pay a colossal burden to keep the companies going. At the beginning of this year, the companies and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC had agreed on an investment outlay of about $3 billion (N240 billion) plus N332 billion to sustain a minimum tempo of activities in the upstream sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sum was later scaled down by 30 per cent with the government approving a capital contribution of $1.75 billion and N18 billion. The government's share is about $2.4 billion of the initial investment proposal because of its 60 per cent equity in the ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even then, the government went further to increase its investment last month by raising its spending level for Shell Petroleum Development Company from the initial $1.085 billion. This amount is however lower than the N1.35 billion which the company proposed to spend this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chevron's investment was also raised to $846 million. The company had proposed $900million. by last month, the government had raised the working budgets of the six companies beyond the level at which they were pegged in July, that is when they were cut by 30 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinarily, these huge sums would not have raised eyebrows since the government derives more than 90 per cent of its revenue from the sector. The snag, however, is the belief in officialdom that the joint venture partners short-change the government by padding up its expenditures. There is the suspicion that the government may unknowingly have been funding the ventures almost 100 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Etete, the oil minister, said so boldly a few months ago when he announced that the oil companies were fleecing Nigeria and proceeded to set up a monitoring unit in the ministry to screen all cash call claims by the operators. To Ani and members of his group, all the brouhaha in the oil industry could be avoided by a stroke of privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so easy, counters Sam Aluko, chairman of the National Economic Intelligence Committee and Tam David-West, former petroleum resources minister who are leading the arguments against privatisation. They too have equally persuasive arguments. The first of these is the soul-stirring one of the national interest. They say that in the event of privatisation, few, if any Nigerian, would benefit from the upstream sector. As a highly capital intensive sector, very few Nigerians among those paraded as wealthy industrialists would be able to afford what it takes, thus leaving the field wide open to foreign domination. They call in evidence the experience of Iran during the Iran-Iraq war when the United States directed oil companies to leave that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a mere appeal to nationalist instincts, they have insisted that privatisation would not automatically stop Nigeria from being short-changed.  They say that given the Nigerian environment, these companies may still be able to cook the books, thereby drastically reducing whatever tax and royalty should ordinarily accrue to the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their recommendation is that rather than privatisation, the government should move to curb corruption in the oil industry, strengthen its monitoring unit and then encourage indigenous prospectors to build up their companies into viable ones like the multinationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an example of what government initiative can achieve, they readily point to Norway, a fellow OPEC member-country, whose state oil company, Statoil, dominates crude oil exploration and production in that country. They believe the same could be done in Nigeria with the National Petroleum Development Company whose output for now is a paltry 10,000 barrels per day. It is not quite clear whose argument will sway Sani Abacha, the head of state. The World Bank team, Theweek learnt, has been told to call again sometime this month. In the meantime, Abacha has precious little time to make up his mind as the year races to a close and with it the 1997 budget that would spell out the administration's economic thrust, especially the bit on privatisation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - Amidst cries of biting poverty, government prepares to reflate the economy in next year's budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of next year, the economy would be growing at the rate of 8 per cent, unemployment rate would be sliced by half, inflation rate will tumble single-digit figure just as effective demand is expected to receive a boom.  Wishful thinking? No, says the government. To achieve this rather tall order, government is working round the clock to enshrine policies that will give vent to this dream in the 1997 fiscal budget.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The series of meetings that precede each budget started last Monday in Abuja with the Joint Planning Board made up of directors-general, National Planning Commission. The five-step meetings will culminate in the December 12 NPC meeting to be chaired by Sani Abacha, the head of state, before the budget's final approval by the provisional ruling council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the take-off of the JPB meeting, officials from the presidency, the ministry of finance and the Central Bank have been meeting to envision the thrust of the budget. By mid last month, an official of the CBN in Lagos who wanted to speak with Paul Ogwuma, CBN governor, in Abuja could not do so as the governor had reportedly gone to Aso Rock for a discussion on the budget. Theweek learnt that the seemingly early preparation for the 1977 budget is to forestall the late announcement of budgets which has characterised the Abacha regime from inception. This year's budget was not announced until February 15, 46 clear days into the year. This, sources say, affected its implementation, especially the various aspects of reform and revenue generation. Government is said to be bent on announcing the next budget within the first two weeks of January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early preparations apart, next year's budget will pose little problem to government as there seems to be a level of consensus amongst various interest groups, including the government, on what the cardinal thrust of the next fiscal year should be. The organised private sector, represented by the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, the National Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture and the Nigeria Employers Consultative Association, is in unison that the economy needs to be reflated.  In their various submissions to government; the three bodies have advocated the injection of more money into the economy. The consensus is that this year's economy has largely been characterised by lack of effective consumer demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the various bodies have praised government for its apparent success in managing the macro-economy as manifested in the declining rate of inflation, foreign exchange and interest rates stability, improved revenue generation and increased accountability, these have not translated to poverty alleviation and job creation which could have boosted consumer demand. In its first-half report, MAN lamented that the ware-houses of its members were brimming with unsold stock worth N6 billion. Sam Ohuabunwa, executive chairman, Pfizer Plc, made the point explicitly at a public lecture in Lagos week when he said that government's economic success has been at a great social cost to Nigerians. Analysts argue that since the budget is made for Nigerians, its success could only be measured in terms of the extent to which it has helped to solve their problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if in deference to these demands, Anthony Ani, finance minister, hinted two weeks ago that next year's budget would aim to reflate the economy. He did not elaborate on how this would be achieved, but allayed fears that such monetary policies would lead to hyperinflation. To support his argument of non-inflationary growth, Ani said the fear expressed that injection of the Petroleum Trust Fund into the economy would be inflationary was misplaced, as the rate of inflation actually went down from 72.8 per cent a year ago to just 44.7 per cent by July. He said government would ensure that the expected reflation would not cause inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts are however skeptical. They say that the only way to achieve low inflation is to embark on capital projects that have the potential of generating employment rather than wage increases. Nze Ik Muo, a financial analyst, told Theweek that government can only reflate by embarking on investment in infrastructure that would reduce the cost of doing business.  Such investments, he said, should focus on roads network, telecommunications, electricity and health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspicion is that the broad policy thrust of next year's budget will not be significantly different from the prevailing one. Having achieved some success in its &quot;guided deregulation as government hopes to unify the dual exchange rates, privatize more of its parastatals, especially the telecommunications and energy subsectors, and carry through its tax and port reforms. But whether all this will translate to a happier, richer citizenry is another question.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - A Letter written by social scientist and minority rights champion Claude Ake, the day he died in the recent crash, spells trouble for the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claude Ake, renowned professor of Social Science and Director of the Port Harcourt-based Centre for Advanced Social Science, was unusually calm that Thursday, November 7. After a four-day workshop of the centre, he summoned a meeting of the board of directors, discussed his vision and later met with officials of Ogba Solidarity, the umbrella organisation of his people. At 2.  30 p.m. Ake left for the Port Harcourt International Airport and boarded the ADC flight 086 that crashed near Lagos that evening killing all 143 person on board.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before Ake's death, arrangements had been made by the management of the Liquefied Natural Gas company for an enlightenment forum for Ogba people.  The forum was designed to educate the people on the gas transmission pipeline for the liquefied natural gas project. On November 14, exactly a week after the plane crash, representatives of Ogba people converged at the Civic Centre, Omoku, Rivers State, ostensibly for the schedule enlightenment forum. But instead of the forum, what took place was a showdown with officials of the LNG Limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spoiler, Theweek learnt, was a letter which Ake had written to the LNG on the day of his death. The letter, written in conjunction with Ogba Solidarity group, contained a number of demands. With the demands yet to be met, J.J. Brian-West, community relations manager of Nigeria LNG Limited, laboured in vain November 14 to convince the community of the company's good mission in Ogba land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeals by Okechukwu Ogbowu, chairman of Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni local government area, fell of deaf ears after Chinyere Nwokidu, spokesman of Ogba Solidarity, told the audience that Ake an indigene of Ogba land and a trustee of the organisation, had written to the company the day he died, announcing the postponement of the forum until proper discussions were held with the leaders of the clan. Nwokidu, a member of the National Economic Intelligence Committee and former commissioner for information and culture in Rivers State, alleged that the company had bribed some traditional rulers in the area with N4,000 and drinks in a bid to get the enlightenment forum to go ahead contrary to Ake's wish. This information immediately electrified the venue as it added to the anger of the crowd. To douse the fire, G.O. Obando, head of public affairs of LNG Limited, explained that the money in question was not a bribe but was meant to be used by the traditional rulers to mobilise people for the enlightenment forum. With Obando's explanation achieving no result, the forum had to hurriedly adjourn for security reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogba people are demanding an economic stake and participation in the LNG project as well as an assurance of sustainable development with reference to the environmental impact assessment report of the LNG project. The people are said to be irked by claims of the company in various publications that &quot;to obtain constructive input from the indigenous population, discussions were held by Nigeria LNG with the local Finima and Bonny communities and with those along the envisaged route of the gas transmission pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogba Solidarity has refuted the claims, saying that the company has never had any discussion with Ogba people. Ogba, the major producer of oil and gas in Rivers State, has two of the three gas plants for the gas project. They are located in Obite and Obrikom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ake, an unrepentant minority rights crusader, had sensitized his people early this year on the need to evolve strategies for participation in the oil and gas industry. He told the people in September to unite in the pursuit of their community rights. In keeping with his advice, the people of the area have been mobilized to resist attempts by oil companies to sidetrack the community in their oil/gas exploration and exploitation activities. They have vowed to stop the LNG pipeline should the company refuse to engage in dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogba people are not acting in isolation. The fight for justice by the oil producing areas recently received a boost when Dan Etete, the petroleum resources minister, directed oil companies to look into the genuine demands of their host communities to avoid a repeat of the Ogoni incident. The meaning: Enough lessons may have been learnt from the Ogoni tragedy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - Ms. Abrehet Abraha, one of the first women film producers of Ethiopia premiered her first film, &quot;Bodiless Spirit,&quot; at the American Film Institute of the Kennedy Center, Washington, DC on December 5, 1996. There was a special reception following the screening in which the renowned Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony was featured accompanied by traditional music. &quot; Bodiless Spirit&quot; being released in the USA under a new title, &quot;Broken Strings, &quot; is a feature length video/film produced and distributed by Ms. Abraha through Dimbulka Production and marks the beginning of a new wave of quality products from Ethiopia. It is also the first of its genre to be subtitled for release to an American market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bodiless Spirit&quot; or &quot;Broken Strings&quot; is a film that explores the powerful and uncontrollable feelings which erupt when fate causes a close interplay between love and jealousy. Set against the backdrop of the modern city of Addis Ababa, the film also provides a fresh look into life in contemporary urban Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Abrehet, an energetic young entrepeur, founded her company in 1986 in Addis Ababa where she successfully produced quality audio recordings of cultural music, compact discs of children's songs, and videos of cultural music. The film is her latest venture through which she is taking a bold step into the international arena. Ms. Abrehet displays a remarkable passion for the work she does in the field of commericial promotion of Ethiopian art.  When asked why she devotes so much energy and time to her work, Ms. Abrehet replies: It is of my own experience as a modern Ethiopian woman who greatly values her traditions and ancestry that I developed a profound love of Ethiopian culture in all of its myriad forms. Perhaps because I lived through a tumultuous time in Ethiopia's history, I have this intense desire to penetrate Ethiopia's social fabric examining the heart and soul of my people as they live their daily lives today.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And National Lima Party (NLP) candidate Evans Maambo, in an interview on Thursday, said they met on Monday and Tuesday to verify the results but could not make any headway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We found 47 alterations in the record of proceedings which had presidential results. No-one had signed for the changes,&quot; Maambo said. &quot; We demanded for signed copies but they didn't have them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And according to Maambo election officials voluntarily admitted that &quot;they reopened the material and equipment after elections&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The returning officer Mrs Hamusunse revealed that she did not do the alterations alone but with the responsible authorities and wondered why she was now being left alone to defend this,&quot; Maambo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some changes which were made to Nega Nega polling station altered President Chiluba's result from 14 to 210 votes and Mung'omba's form 147 to 93. Others in Njomona 1 the ZDC president's results were reduced from 219 to 60 votes while Chiluba's were increased to 319 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maambo also revealed that two registers were used in the Mazabuka Constituency - the 1991 register and the Nikuv prepared one thereby making it difficult to know who was a registered voter and who wasn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verification meeting was attended by Maambo, ZDC's Cypriano Haakantu, independent candidate Dowdy Chindindindi, election officials, ZIMT, the MMD, local police and polling agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Guy Scott, the NLP co-chairman, will petition the Chongwe result where he claims a lot of anomalies and multiple voting has surfaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have evidence that some people voted on the strength of voter certificates issued inside Nkausu's house and others being brought from outside the constituency,&quot; Scott said. &quot;We believe these individuals who have been given false addresses within Chongwe have been issued with a second card.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Malambo, NLP candidate, Daniel Mwale, whose name was wrongly entered as Daniel Mumba is also petitioning the results of the November 18 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the NLP candidates cited deliberate barring of their agents from monitoring the election process, the NLP symbol being distorted and supporters being intimidated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Government's involvement in the procurement and distribution of farming inputs has had a bearing on the current shortage of fertiliser in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the latest issue of the Agricultural Market Bulletin, government's involvement in the agro sector, despite its claims of liberalisation, had resulted in the private sector's relaxed attitude to venture into fertiliser trading operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agricultural weekly publication said private operators were very cautious to venture into the sector taking into account the relatively high risks involved because nearly all fertilizer had to be imported and also because of competition from the government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reportedly, this reluctance by the private sector is a direct result of the continued active involvement of the government in fertiliser marketing due to the fact that many farmers continue to heavily rely on government to meet their seasonal input needs,&quot; the bulletin read in part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite some private institutions having the commodity, most farmers who have depended on credit purchasing, were having difficulties to access the fertiliser as it was being offered on a cash basis only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently the country is experiencing a fertiliser shortage in most areas in the country which still have not received farming inputs despite the farming season having started two months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shortage, which is more pronounced in the peri-urban and remote areas of the country, however, confirms fears of a drop in maize production this farming season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shortage has further been worsened by the Peasant Farmers Union of Zambia's cancellation of a 100 metric tonne basal and top dressing fertiliser order for unexplained reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union had in October secured a credit line with an American fertilizer manufacturer for the fertiliser consignment that was due to arrive in the country a fortnight ago , in a bid to supplement government's delayed efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the bulletin has revealed that maize and mealie meal exports have continued with a total of 135,000 metric tonnes of maize and 20,000 tonnes of mealie meal expected to be exported this year from July 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Operational problems at the Nkana Smelter accounted for Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines' (ZCCM) low copper production figures in October and November, explained the company's public relations director, Francis Musonda, on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musonda, in a statement to The Post on Friday, said the decline in production figures is as a result of operational problems at the Nkana Smelter during the month following the shutdown of the Nkana Oxygen plant for maintenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Production of finished copper fell 11, 805 tonnes short of the 52,217 tonnes target for the two months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ZCCM's September report released on December 3, a loss of K95 billion was reported for the second quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total sales revenue for the quarter was K290,125 million, a decrease of 27 per cent over the K397,364 million achieved in the September quarter of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report attributed the decrease to the depreciation of the kwacha, lower copper prices, together with reduced copper sales volumes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musonda, however, said the conglomerate is relying on the rehabilitated Luanshya smelter to improve copper output.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The smelter, which is expected to be operational by the end of this month, was closed in 1994 due to under utilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A decision was made to re-build the smelter and place it on standby when ZCCM accumulated 65,000 tonnes of concentrates which could have been treated had there been the capacity to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The start-up of the smelter is also necessitated by the Mufulira Smelter operations which are currently at risk due to the non-availability of a stand- by 12 MVA electric furnace transformer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, production figures for cobalt have maintained an upward trend since May, Musonda disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cobalt Production, at 1155 tonnes for the second quarter, was 73 per cent higher than the 667 tonnes produced in the corresponding quarter of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ZCCM report said this was due to the availability of high grade Nchanga cobalt concentrate. Sales of cobalt, at 1,146 tonnes were also 125 per cent higher than the 509 tonnes sold in the same period of 1995.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - It was interesting to see and hear our honourables taking oaths at State House, promising to do their best for the people of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A colleague came to see me after the swearing-in ceremony and asked whether such ceremonies were necessary and important since very few of the appointees would live up to their pledges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My colleague, who is very critical of the current regime, explained that what he had witnessed was a near circus and amounted to nothing in real of terms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that in the past five years during which the MMD has been in power, ministers and other government leaders have done so much harm to this nation that one wonders what happened to their promises at the beginning of their term of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One example, he cited was that President Chiluba himself and his advisers have not been very honest in their dealings on national duties. The handling of the 1996 Constitution for example, left much to be desired and was below acceptable standards and a departure from democratic norms under which the MMD government pledged to rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of all stakeholders reaching a consensus through a constituent assembly as suggested by most civic organisations and opposition parties, the MMD leaders, taking advantage of their majority in parliament, hijacked the occasion and ended up having a party constitution which only appeals to the MMD cadres, instead of the nation as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date the current constitution remains the most condemned piece of document which has failed to attract any great brains both within and outside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I told my friend that the swearing ceremony appears to be a mere formality in Zambia and there is very little commitment on the part of the appointed officers. To most of the leaders oaths taking starts and ends at State House and nobody cares to remember this important occasion thereafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I however, advised my colleague that as a citizen, he had a right to petition any leader whom he reasonably suspects to be living outside the expected norms of someone in a leadership position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I further advised that it was the responsibility of every citizen to check the excesses and unacceptable conduct and behaviour of our leaders. Leaders should learn to live by example and when they conduct themselves dishonourably, they should be made accountable for their misdeeds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Vice-President challenged the handicapped, who he said comprised 10 per cent of the Zambian population, to refrain from self pity and work towards integrating themselves into society.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice-President Miyanda, officiating at a prize-giving ceremony after a wheel-chair race organised by Hands Ministries - a non-governmental organisation for the handicapped - at Lusaka's Pamodzi Hotel on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier handicapped persons presented a petition to Vice-President Miyanda in which they complained of poor facilities and utilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition included access to road crossing, buildings and ramps for the handicapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have received the petition but I won't comment much on it,&quot; Vice- President Miyanda said. &quot; I agree there is need to facilitate these things to show that the government cares.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And community development minister Newstead Zimba disclosed that the government had already established a National Trust Fund for the handicapped and the Public Welfare system was under review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For these schemes to succeed there must be harmony and mutual trust amongst all players,&quot; Zimba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race, flagged off from Kabwe round-about to Pamodzi Hotel, attracted one woman, Fatima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race was won by a finalist in the Atlanta Olympics, Lango Sinkamba, who beat 8 other participants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia's former foreign minister, Vernon Mwaanga, has sued Newsweek International for 50,000 U.S. dollars as compensation for libel and damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magazine carried a story in 1994 in which it had implied that Mwaanga had recruited people at the ministry of foreign affairs to operate as drug agents and was using his position as minister to facilitate a drug syndicate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwaanga said in Lusaka Monday that the legal battle against the magazine was expected to take off on Jan. 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that he had decided to take legal action against the magazine so that it retracts the story and pays compensation for the damage it had caused to his reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correspondence between his lawyers and Newsweek indicate that Mwaanga is asking to be paid 50,000 dollars as compensation for damages, but the magazine has offered an out of court settlement of 10,000 dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For me really it is not the money that matters but for my name to be cleared of these allegations and in that regard I have asked Newsweek International to retract what they had printed about me,&quot; Mwaanga said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwaanga, together with the former Zambian speaker of parliament, Sikota Wina, and his wife Nakatindi Wina, who was community development minister, were forced to step down in 1994, amid accusations of drug-dealing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that time, several international financial institutions had threatened to withhold their aid unless the Zambian president dealt with the problem of drug trafficking among highly-placed officials of his government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - The Organization of African Unity (OAU) on Tuesday welcomed the truce between the government of the Central African Republic and rebel soldiers, which was negotiated in Bangui by a delegation of four African presidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidents of Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon and Mali were dispatched by the Franco-African summit, which was held at Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation secured the truce on Sunday after talks with President Ange- Felix Patasse and the rebels who had been calling for his resignation, among other demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press release, the OAU expressed ardent hope that the truce will lead in the shortest time possible to a durable agreement for the definitive resolution to the present crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization reiterated its support for the on-going mediation efforts by the four African countries and said it was closely following up the situation as it unfolds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current army mutiny in Bangui was the third of its kind to be staged in 1996 against the democratically-elected government of Patasse, who was elected in 1993.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SINGAPORE, Singapore (PANA) - The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, has urged African countries to continue implementing policies to reduce bloated budget deficits and encourage domestic savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told ZIANA in Singapore that it had been proved the world over that high fiscal deficits retarded economic growth, and unless controlled, only prolonged the hardships of vulnerable groups already suffering under harsh market reforms being implemented in some countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his organisation would be willing to give expert advice to those African countries willing to listen and implement practical measures aimed at promoting growth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are working together with the World Bank trying to create conditions for growth for countries in Africa. This requires implementation of policies that have been successful in other countries in similar kinds of situations,&quot; Camdessus said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we look at policies that have been successful, they are policies where governments are trying to reduce their deficits in order to open some opportunities to encourage savings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maintaining deficits exceeding 10 percent of gross domestic product, he said, would not make it possible to sustain, let alone promote, economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe, which embarked on wide-based market reforms in 1991, has disappointed major donors such as the IMF by its failure to reduce the budget deficit to a sustainable level of five percent of GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fiscal indiscipline, which saw the deficit in 1995 shoot up to 10 percent, led to the suspension of balance-of-payments credit from the IMF worth over 100 million U.S.dollars in September, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the government has made attempts to cut spending in non- essential services so as to win IMF support, seen as crucial to kick-start the reform effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent talks in Harare between the organisation and the government failed to yield positive results, beyond expressions of intent from the lending institution and promises of further negotiations early in January to assess progress made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's dilemma is how to balance the books in the face of unplanned expenditure of more than 190 million dollars on salaries and bonuses for civil servants. This is at a time when other essential services such as health and education are competing for the government's scarce cash resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Projections are that the deficit in the year to June 1997 will exceed the original forecast of 8.5 percent, a figure unlikely to please experts at the IMF headquarters in Washington.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The Organization of African Unity (OAU) has called for a multisectorial approach that would simultaneously meet the continent's quest for universal vaccination and deal with the ravages caused by poverty, famine and malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Dakar Tuesday, the organization's Assistant Secretary General, Pascal Gayama, also called for the uplifting of the the situation of women &quot; since this directly affects the situation of the child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was presenting a paper titled &quot;The commitment from national leaders for vaccination and immunization&quot; at the 6th Consultative Group meeting of the Children's Vaccine Initiative, CVI, which entered its second and last day in the Senegalese capital on Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are many obstacles on the route that could lead to the the objective of keeping poliomyelitis out of Africa in the year 2000,&quot; Gayama said. &quot;For polio as for most of other diseases, including the AIDS pandemic, nothing is worth than a multisectorial approach capable of containing, at the same time as we search for universal immunization, the ravages caused by poverty, famine and malnutrition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU official noted the high cost of treating epidemics but appealed to rich countries not to deprive Africa of the beneficial progress being made by developed countries in the field of medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gayama also encouraged researchers to explore the potential of traditional herbs and medicine, which could assist in improving the well-being of Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He equally mentioned the Bamako Initiative, whose objective is to bring affordable medicine close to the people and communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He enumerated a series of activities which have been undertaken by African countries under the auspices of the OAU and with assistance from the World Health Organization to strengthen their vaccination activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among these actions, Gayama said, was the recent launching of a major African anti-polio vaccination campaign in South Africa, under the chairmanship of President Nelson Mandela. The campaign was co-launched with Rotary Club International and the WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He regretted, however, that the mushrooming of conflicts had aggravated the situation of African children, some of whom became refugees or displaced persons or faced with &quot;the omnipresent danger of epidemics, including that of HIV/AIDS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet, he said, slightly more than 28 African countries had doubled their rate of vaccinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gayama expressed the OAU's readiness to cooperate with the CVI partners -- UNICEF, UNDP, World Bank, WHO and the Rockfeller Foundation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polio, according to Dr Ebrahim Samba, the World Health Organization regional Director for Africa, still cripples at least 12,000 children on the continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, a grant of one million U.S. dollars will be provided by Wyeth- Lederic Vaccines and Pediatrics for strengthening of a laboratory network for the crippling disease's surveillance in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 55 percent of the company is now owned by the Portuguese firm Barbosa e Almeida, while the remaining 45 percent remains in the hands of the state.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One peculiarity of this privatisation is that Vidreira has been split into two companies, Vidreira de Mocambique, and Cristalaria (crystalware) de Mocambique.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial capital of the second company is 867,000 dollars, 400,000 held by the government and 467,000 by Barbosa e Almeida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the head of the Vidreira Privatisation Commission, Mariamo Carimo, the debts amassed by Vidreira under state ownership will be paid off by the sale of the factory installations valued at 2.5 million dollars to the new companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within three months, the two companies are to pay the state three million dollars, and this money will be used in the first instance to pay off Vidreira's debts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Moslem women in Sudan have suffered from discrimination and degrading treatment ever since that dictator Nimeiri decreed the September laws in 1983. Nimeiri's Islamic laws were draconian enough and have remained on the statute book up until the present day. However, at the end of October the National Islamic Front(NIF) regime passed even more repressive legislation that set to plunge Sudanese women into the primitive world of seventh century Arabia when the Prophet Mohammed used harsh edicts to discipline, regulate and sober up society.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Law with National Impact</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new laws have only been passed by the local council in Khartoum but are being viewed as a prototype for the rest of the country, the South included.  Under the new laws women will be segregated from men in all areas of life.  Public transport is to be segregated with a curtained off area at the front set aside for women. Women will not be allowed to sit in an empty seat next to a male bus driver. Women will no longer be allowed to mix with men in public places. Women can no longer enter any public facility where there are men. This applies especially to shops, meaning that shops will now be catering exclusively either to for men or women. Public occasions such as weddings will be segregated also. There will be no mixed dancing. Women will no longer be allowed into clubs or other social facilities. Women will not be allowed to drive cars. There will be a 5 o'clock curfew on women unless they are accompanied by a bona fide male relative who will have to provide documentation of his status to security officials upon demand. Women will have to observe a stringent form of Islamic dress when in public. In addition, the new law requires all shops and restaurants and food refreshment places to be closed on Fridays and no food will be served in public places during the month of Ramadan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taste Of Things To Come</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Khartoum is the national capital, it has to be expected that the new law will eventually be applied to the whole country. The new law proves the point made by Southerners of the need to secularize the national capital. Khartoum contains communities from all religions and cultures. The diversity mirrors that in the country at large. With the influx of large numbers of people from the South and other marginalised areas of Sudan, it is unlikely that there exists an Arab or Moslem majority in Khartoum. The regime often states that there are three million Southerners living in the North after fleeing from the South and most of them are residents in the national capital. The regime likes to say that these Southerners are opposed to the SPLA and support the NIF. Perhaps it is time to use the regime's statistics against it and point out that in addition to the three million Southerners, there are another three million ethnic Africans from the West and East. They are being ruled in Khartoum by a small minority of Arab Islamic zealots. This is a cast iron case of disenfranchisement and marginalisation. People who have run their own businesses, own considerable property and who have nurtured their own cultural lives whilst living in Khartoum, will now find themselves becoming non-citizens under the new law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Exemptions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new law brings into sharp focus the often mentioned claim by the regime that non-Moslems are exempt from the application of Islamic laws. There are no exemptions whatsoever under the new law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - ELECTIONS Non-Governmental Organisation, Anti-Voter Apathy Project (AVAP) has quietly continued with its democracy enhancing programmes while many other NGOs are on break from the hectic campaigns of last month's presidential and parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AVAP president, Bonny Tembo, said in Lusaka today that instead of resting on their laurels like everybody else was doing his organisation had decided to put into cruise gear their sensitization programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the help of USAID and the Southern University Democratic Governance Project, AVAP has held five co-existence workshops in Rufunsa constituency which brought together members of political parties - Movement for Multi- Party Democracy, United National Independence Party, National Party, Zambia Democratic Congress, National Lima Party and concerned citizens who included village headmen, teachers and Chief Unda-Unda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later the workshops came out with resolutions which called on recently elected members of parliament to form constituency development committee which will embrace all political parties with a view to taking development to all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs were also called upon to be much more accountable to the voters and strive to fulfill their pre-election promises. Furthermore they should learn to consult voters over key developmental issues including bills before parliament and those affecting ordinary people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another resolution participants called on government to improve on the dissemination of information to rural areas in order to empower the people.  They also called on NGOs to spread their awareness campaigns to rural areas, where people are marginalised due to lack of information and communication facilities being enjoyed in both peri-urban and urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also called on national leaders of political parties to try by all means to pursue peaceful means of settling their differences, because if war broke out in the country it will affect most the poor majority who have nowhere to run to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also called on the Church and NGOs to stop politicking and instead embark on the peace crusade in rural areas for the benefit of the rural population which has no access to both print and electronic media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants also called on government to increase the number of police posts in rural areas in order to combat as well as to maintain law and order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since hunger has been identified as one of the obstacles to peace, government should facilitate an effective maize marketing system on behalf of peasant farmers who have no access to maize buyers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kitwe - THE NON-GOVERNMENTAL Coordinating Committee has challenged women to stop the age-old female-folk occupation of gossip and bickering and instead concentrate on supporting each other if full realisation of their fight for recognition by government is to be achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGO-CC national chairperson, Evelyn Manda, said in Kitwe today that present attitudes of women in different NGOs affiliated to the committee will not help their advancement in social and economic circles because important issues are being sidelined.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Manda regretted that non of the NGOs affiliated to the NGO_CC has in the past year submitted their reports on activities held to articulate and put into practice the five priority areas of the Beijing platform of action which the Zambia government has picked as being crucial to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was speaking at the NGO_CC Copperbelt review workshop at Nkana hotel.  At this gathering also will be discussed contributions to be included in the government policy frame work on NGOs and it will also elect new office bearers for the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On recent national elections Ms Manda observed that Zambians should be praised for having voted peacefully in the November 18 elections and that the election of 11 women to the national assembly was an indication that women have the confidence of the electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NGO-CC will in the next five years articulate the Beijing platform of action, set up provincial focal points to ensure that women at grassroots are reached and inform women on issues concerning their welfare.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - THE Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) has spurned an invitation to play the Zimbabwe &quot;Warriors&quot; national team whose soccer association had requested the match to be played on December 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Zimbabwe Football Association, (ZIFA), which has been publicizing the match with great zeal, is still confident that the match against Africa's top-rated team will go ahead even next month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We got the Zimbabwe invitation but because of the fact that our team will be away to East Africa for some time, we decided that we play them (Zimbabwe) some other time and not December 21 as earlier suggested by ZIFA. We thank them for the offer and we will soon announce new dates for the match,&quot; said FAZ acting general secretary, Julio Chiluba in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But former national team coach, Jones Chilengi, in an interview recently advised FAZ to arrange a match against Zimbabwe which he observed would give Zambia a tough match since they play a similar pattern as the South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;FAZ must arrange a match or two against Zimbabweans because I feel Zimbabwe and South Africa play almost the same type of football,&quot; said Chilengi in a telephone interview from his Zimbabwe base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in an interview yesterday ZIFA boss, Leo Mugabe, expressed confidence that his team would play Zambia even if it meant next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just got the news that your team (Zambia) is going to East Africa but still, we hope to play them when they come back because we also want to use the match to prepare for our World Cup matches next month,&quot; said Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIFA is said to have proposed January 4 as the possible date for the match, which has been widely publicized in the Zimbabwean media.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Ghana, Africa's first independent state, appears to have taken the lead once more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Saturday's general election appears to have been the most credible so far this year on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elections were keenly contested in a way that no other has been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were the kind of multi-party elections that Africa needs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no telling who the winner was until the last count. Even the incumbent was not certain of victory until the final result was declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in sharp contrast to the sort of &quot;multi-party&quot; elections the continent has begun to witness once more. They lack the excitement of an election and the results are predictable, not least, because of the open manipulation of the electoral process by incumbent administrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end the election is reduced to a mere ritual in which voters have no real choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia had one such election last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the large amount of money spent on the exercise, it had little meaning. Choice was limited by a controversial constitution that was bulldozed through the legislative process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results when they came were no different from those recorded during the one party era and they are still the subject of dispute by the opposition and election monitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody is certain what they mean anyway, since some of the major contenders were not on the ballot and others were barred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia simply wasted money on an election that is unlikely to change things for the better. The election merely tarnished the country's international image and that of its leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is precisely what President Jerry Rawlings, a former military man, has avoided for his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Rawlings has clearly shamed the people who once were considered Africa's pioneering democrats at their own game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ghanaian election attracted international attention because it was genuine. There were over 100 international observers from many parts of the world who watched over the polling .The Ghanaian authorities had nothing to hide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There cannot be the slightest doubt that those elections will work in Ghana's favor internationally as well as being a source of pride for the Ghanaians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cannot be said of the increasing charades Africa is beginning to witness once more from those who pay lip service to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Genuine democracy is the world trend today and those who delude themselves that they can define democracy in a shallow self-serving way are bound to be isolated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The danger is not, as is commonly perceived, from the international community only. Increasingly citizens of many countries will want to belong to countries that are truly democratic. Those tyrants who will still hope to disguise their true colours by shouting democracy at every forum without practicing it will be exposed one by one - and already some have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is really time for serious and well meaning leaders in Africa. Tyranny has ensured the continent's backwardness amidst valuable resources. It is unlikely that the people will continue to accept this state of affairs. They will want honest and serious leaders and that will happen soon .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bells may be tolling for Africa's tyrants who should seriously learn something from what has happened in Ghana. It shows clearly that with devotion and honesty, democracy can work in even in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is fitting that Ghana, the continent's first independent state, should lead the way in this regard. Perhaps, just as Kwame Nkrumah proved the inspiration for Africa's liberation, President Rawlings will also be the pioneer of real and sustainable democracy in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, President Rawlings has set high standards which should put to shame those who preach democracy from rooftops but are unwilling, or too afraid, to practice it. Such leaders merely waste their peoples' time and can only ensure the rapid impoverishment of their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody can have faith in them when they do not practice what they preach and therefore they have no credibility even when they are overwhelmingly retained in fraudulent &quot;democratic elections&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - THE Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) has established a court of justice to deal with legal matters involving member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officially opening the first meeting of the COMESA committee of legal experts at Lusaka's Mulungushi International Conference Center yesterday, acting secretary general, Anastase Munyabatenzi, said the framework for the court had already been provided for by ministers of justice and attorneys general in the treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court of justice is already charged with ensuring the adherence to law in the interpretation of the treaty,&quot; Munyabatenzi said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And legal affairs minister Vincent Malambo, in an official statement read on his behalf by solicitor general Sam Chisulo, urged COMESA to seek a more consolidated economic integration for all African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two day conference will mainly consider activities leading to the creation of the court of justice such as the establishment of a temporary registry at COMESA secretariat, the appointment of the registrar of the court, the process of nominating the judges, the appointment of judges to be effected by the authority of heads of states and government and the determination of the seat of the court after the judges have been appointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Malambo observed that in the context of the globalisation of world trade and the formation of large economic blocs, Africa might become increasingly marginalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is now an accepted fact that the world is fast becoming divided into powerful regional blocs increasingly becoming larger in size and you will all agree that in the context of the globalisation of world trade and the formation of large economic blocs, Africa may become increasingly marginalised&quot; Malambo noted. &quot;It therefore becomes imperative that while we have already made great progress in economic integration such as under COMESA this should be consolidated in order to face the rapid changes taking place globally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting has been poorly attended, with only representatives from Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Kenya, Swaziland, Sudan and Kenya.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Even though the errors contained in the Nikuv Computers prepared register were purported to have been corrected, a number of voters' cards were left uncollected at the polling stations, observed the OAU delegation that came to monitor last month's elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) group also noted that in some polling stations, a small number of registered voters could not find their names at the polling stations where they had registered and consequently could not vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU team further observed that even though elections on polling day took place in a calm, serene and peaceful atmosphere, many parties pointed out that the controversy over certain clauses of the constitution, the voters' registration exercise and unequal access to the media had caused uneasiness in certain sections of the population.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Certain parties thought that the Electoral Commission was independent and discharged its responsibilities in an objective manner while others did not think so,&quot; the OAU report read in part. &quot;In this connection, it is important that the Commission should not only be independent but it must be perceived by all concerned to be so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU also expressed concern over disagreements in &quot;the manner in which the registration exercise was carried out&quot; as a &quot;reflection of the deep mistrust that exists between some political parties and the Electoral Commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also notes that the members of the independent Electoral Commission were appointed &quot;too late&quot; to effectively stamp their authority on the conduct of the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU delegation, which was headed by Mozambique, also observed that the political tension created by the controversy over the constitutional clauses heightened by the retroactive application of the two-term clause and the unacceptability of the voters register to all the parties because of what some parties considered as flawed registration exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU election observer team which monitored the elections in Lusaka, Copperbelt, Eastern and Southern provinces advised that there was need to have consensus on issues such as the Constitution, an independent Electoral Commission and the process of voters registration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These would enhance sustainable peace and stability not only in Zambia but also in the region and in the continent as a whole,&quot; concludes the OAU report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report exposes distortions in the state owned and government controlled Zambia Daily Mail of December 4 that the OAU had declared the Zambian elections free and fair.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - In a joint statement issued by the Tanzanian Government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) dated December 1996, the Government of Tanzania states that all Rwandese refugees can now return to their country in safety and that all of them are expected to return home by 31 December 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is concerned that this statement, addressed to all Rwandese refugees in Tanzania, makes no mention of options for those refugees who continue to fear human rights violations on return to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The refugees are not just an anonymous mass of half a million people who can be treated in an identical fashion,&quot;Amnesty International said. &quot;There may be many among them who would be at risk on return. It is the responsibility of governments where they have sought asylum and of the UNHCR to ensure that such people have protection.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this unprecedented situation, over half a million people are being expected to return at less than one month&quot;s notice, with apparently no provision for those who continue to fear human rights violations in Rwanda to exercise their right to seek asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a departure from situations elsewhere in the world where UNHCR has been closely involved and where some provisions have been made for identifying those who may be at risk in the country they would return to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Overlooking individuals&quot; well-founded fears of return without giving them a chance to have their case examined could amount in some cases to a violation of the fundamental principle of non-refoulement,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The joint statement makes no mention of the continuing human rights problems in Rwanda, where around 87,000 prisoners -- many of them arbitrarily arrested -- are detained without charge or trial in life-threatening conditions and where the justice system is still not functioning. Amnesty International has also documented a pattern of &quot;disappearances&quot; and extrajudicial executions in Rwanda which have persisted throughout 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior representatives of the Rwandese Government have stated publicly and in meetings with Amnesty International delegates that measures will be taken to ensure the safety of returnees. The organization welcomes assurances that arbitrary arrests will be stopped, that some prisoners will be released to ease the overcrowding in detention centres and that properties will be restored to their rightful owners. However, close monitoring is needed to ensure that these promises are fulfilled and that longer-term safeguards against human rights violations are put in place. In particular, a fair and functional system of justice must become operational to charge and try those who participated in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanzanian Government and the UNHCR should insist on clear independent evidence of respect for human rights by the Rwandese Government, before sending refugees back to an otherwise uncertain future, Amnesty International said. Until proper safeguards have been established, it cannot be concluded that it is safe for all Rwandese refugees to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty international is concerned that the international community has been playing down the real level of human rights violations in Rwanda in order to entice refugees to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This decision by the Tanzanian Government to expel more than half a million Rwandese refugees to an uncertain fate in Rwanda disregards the basic human rights of refugees and Tanzania's commitments under international law,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By issuing this joint statement, the UNHCR is effectively rubber-stamping this decision by Tanzania which contravenes its own basic principles of protection of refugees. Instead, the UNHCR should be publicly protesting at Tanzania's decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A deadline of less than a month for the return of around 550,000 refugees who have shown little sign of wanting to return to Rwanda in the last two years is not only unrealistic, but creates unacceptable pressure on the refugees,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR officials have stated that this will not be a forced return, yet the refugees appear not to have been allowed to decide individually whether they can return. A return in these circumstances would effectively amount to forcible repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is appealing for an immediate withdrawal of the decision by the Tanzanian Government to expel all Rwandese refugees by 31 December 1996 and is urging the UNHCR to desist from taking any actions which would condone this decision. The joint statement also requires that any &quot; vulnerable persons&quot; be identified by Monday 9 December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International delegates were present in Rwanda when around 500,000 refugees returned from Zaire in mid November 1996. To date, there have not been large-scale arrests or killings of these returnees in Rwanda. However, in view of the persistent pattern of human rights violations in Rwanda, it is still much too early to judge their longer- term safety in the country. This therefore constitutes an inadequate basis for concluding that refugees from Tanzania can now also return in safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation of refugees in Tanzania is significantly different from those in Zaire and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the reasons that refugees returned from Zaire appears to have been because their camps were under attack, they no longer had access to food or humanitarian aid and staying in Zaire would have meant certain death,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, the tens of thousands of refugees who returned from Burundi earlier in the year were fleeing a situation of violence there. More than 1, 000 of those who returned from Burundi have since been arrested. These events and the circumstances behind the returns from Zaire and Burundi appear to have been deliberately overlooked by the international community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . GREAT LAKES - Complex Emergency Situation Report No. 9 Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, December 3, 1996. Note: The last situation report was dated November 27, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda people, who are Tutsi of Rwandan origin, settled in the Mulenge hills of South Kivu, Zaire, and the Masisi region of North Kivu, Zaire, more than 200 years ago. Sporadic ethnic violence in the Masisi region has occurred since 1959, but it again escalated in the fall of 1995 as the former Rwandan army (the ex-FAR) and the Rwandan Hutu militia (the Interahamwe) targeted Banyarwanda Tutsi in an apparent attempt to create an area of Hutu control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1996, the situation in the Uvira region of South Kivu began to resemble that of the Masisi region, as government-sanctioned harassment of Banyamulenge Tutsis intensified. On October 8, 1996, the South Kivu Deputy Governor declared that Banyamulenge residents should leave the area within seven days or risk treatment as rebels. On October 14, fighting broke out between the Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairian Army (FAZ) near Runingo refugee camp, in South Kivu, forcing the roughly 220,000 refugees to flee.  The Banyamulenge joined forces with other Zairian rebels to form the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), and the fighting spread, moving up the eastern border of Zaire from Uvira to Bukavu, as well as south from Rutshuru (North Kivu) to Goma. As a result of shelling from Rwanda on October 26 and November 1, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kibumba, Katale, and Kahindo camps near Goma, fled to Mugunga camp. Both the ex-FAR and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)- financed Zairian Camp Security Contingent (CZSC), became involved in the fighting. After suffering defeat, the FAZ and CZSC retreated to the west, looting villages and displacing Zairians from Goma town and surrounding areas.  Following Hutu attacks from Mugunga camp on Goma town, the ADFL counter- attacked on November 14, forcing the ex-FAR and Interahamwe to retreat to the west and compelling hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan refugees: An estimated 600,000 Rwandan refugees have returned from the Goma area camps to Rwanda. Tens of thousands of Rwandan refugees from the Bukavu and Uvira camps remain unaccounted for. One thousand Rwandan refugees have been reported in Zambia, as well as 1,200 newly arrived in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian refugees: Of the 143,000 Burundian refugees originally in the Uvira area, UNHCR reports some 62,000 refugees have returned to Burundi and about 13,500 have arrived in Tanzania. The location of the balance from Uvira is unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newly Displaced: Fleeing continued fighting in Burundi, a new caseload of about 73,500 Burundian refugees has entered Tanzania. Approximately 35,000 Zairians have fled to Tanzania. One thousand Zairian Tutsis are reported in Brazzaville, Congo, and 17,000 Zairians are reported in Uganda. The U.S.  Embassy in Zaire estimates that 170,000 Zairians have been displaced by the conflict in eastern Zaire, including 20,000 from Uvira, 60,000 from Bukavu, 40,000 from Goma, and 50,000 from rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unknown Populations: There are an estimated 225,000 to 285,000 people on the move within Zaire. It is uncertain whether these are displaced Zairians, Rwandan or Burundian refugees or former Rwandan militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations (U.N.) World Food Program (WFP) reported that some 12, 000 Rwandan refugees, in good condition, crossed from Goma to Gisenyi on November 27. The returnees were reportedly originally from Kahindo and Katale camps near Goma and fled to the west when the camps were attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 27, a convoy of relief agencies found some 40,000 Rwandan refugees in fairly good health in Minova, located about 35 km southwest of Goma. On November 28, some of these refugees began moving towards Goma.  Relief agencies set up way stations between Minova and Goma to distribute high protein biscuits and to provide water, sanitation, and health care and an estimated 20,000 crossed the border from November 29 - 30. Relief agencies have been denied access to Minova since November 29 due to fighting in the area, but distribution of biscuits continues at way stations in Sake, Mugunga, and Kulungu. Fighting has reportedly pushed those remaining in the Minova area westward further into Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Returnees continue to cross at Cyangugu, with UNHCR reporting 1,475 returnees on November 29 and 30. Since mid-October, about 8,000 refugees have returned through the Bukavu- Cyangugu corridor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Situation by Region</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uvira: Uvira is reportedly calm and under Banyamulenge control. However, relief agencies have not been permitted to cross into Uvira since expatriate relief workers evacuated on October 22. A U.N./non-governmental organization (NGO) team departed Bukavu by road for Uvira on December 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bukavu: UNCHR is planning for the possible return of 30,000 Rwandan refugees through the Bukavu/Cyangugu corridor and for some 25,000 Zairian IDPs who are making their way to Bukavu. In preparation, NGOs have established four way stations to provide water and medical assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs currently working in Bukavu include Concern International, Medecins Sans Frontieres/International (MSF/I), International Rescue Committee (IRC), Save the Children Fund/UK (SCF/UK), Christian Aid, Oxfam, and Caritas. U.N agencies and ICRC are also working in Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP is planning a small scale targeted distribution to vulnerable groups in hospitals, orphanages, and to 8,000 to 9,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees in or near Bukavu. ICRC has already supplied 6.5 tons of water purification materials for a lake-water treatment plant in Bukavu and plans to continue providing fuel and water purification materials for the next six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goma: The Nyamulagira volcano, north of Goma near the Kitale and Kahindo camps, erupted on December 1. As the camps are empty, the lava flow slow- moving, and the area sparsely populated, no populations were reportedly endangered by the eruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member of USAID's Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) who travelled to Goma on November 27 reported that Goma town is calm but has no water or electricity. The following relief organizations are currently operating in Goma: American Refugee Committee (ARC) Merlin, Trocaire, SCF/UK, Concern International, Catholic Relief Services (CRS)/Caritas, Oxfam, MSF/I, ICRC, UNHCR, and WFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kisangani: WFP reports that some 2,000 displaced persons are reportedly in need of assistance in and near Kisangani, 500 km northwest of Goma. WFP is waiting for Government of Zaire (GOZ) authorization to airlift some 95 metric tons (MT) of food commodities directly from Entebbe, Uganda to Kisangani. So far clearance has only been given to fly via Kinshasha. ICRC is now using Kindu, south of Kisangani and west of Bukavu, as its logistical base. ICRC is assisting some 300 Zairian IDPs in Kindu and providing supplies for the Zairian Red Cross which is assisting 500 IDPs between Kindu and Shabunda. The U.N. Department for Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA) reports that the situation in Kisangani has become increasingly volatile. Some 400 Zairian soldiers have remained in Kisangani after fleeing the rebel advance in north Kivu and shooting and looting are common occurrences. The NGO Aviation Sans Frontieres is reportedly pulling out of the area after its aircraft came under fire on December 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda: Over 600,000 Rwandan returnees have poured across the Zaire border since November 15. UNHCR states that nearly all have arrived in their home communes. In the Kigali area, relief agencies and the Government of Rwanda (GOR) have set up 19 temporary centers to assist some 20,000 returnees who have nowhere to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From November 17-28, WFP pre-positioned 3,454 MT of food commodities in Byumba, Gisenyi, Gitarama, Kibungo, Kibuye, Kigali (Rural and Ville), Nyagatare and Ruhengeri prefectures, representing approximately 890,000 weekly rations. NGOs are distributing food at the commune level. Some NGOs are distributing a full month ration, but most are initially distributing weekly rations, and will switch to distribution of monthly rations in the future. WFP, UNICEF, and NGOs decided to incorporate Unimix, a high-protein vitamin- enriched blended food, into the WFP general ration to avoid the need for supplemental feeding centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOR Ministry of Rehabilitation and Social Integration reported on November 25 that there were 135,000 families without shelter in rural areas and 65,000 families in urban areas, of which about 20% are in Kigali. Some returnees find their homes occupied by squatters when they return. The GOR has given squatters two weeks to vacate dwellings belonging to returnees and has set up temporary transit centers to house returnees and displaced residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) reported on November 28 that the GOR has arrested 21 returnees in Byumba, Gisenyi, Kigali Rural and Ville, and Ruhengeri prefectures for involvement in the 1994 genocide. Currently there are 110 U.N. human rights observers in Rwanda, 65 in the field and 45 based in Kigali. Another 35 are due to arrive shortly. To address concerns about potential human rights abuses, HRFOR issued a draft appeal to fund an additional 200 human rights monitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Save the Children/United Kingdom (SCF/UK) and ICRC have registered a total of 5,500 unaccompanied children in Rwanda. Of these, 1,000 have been reunified with family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi: WFP's request to the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee to import 2,500 MT of food per month for a caseload of 130,000 people has been approved. To date, importation has only been possible by road from Isaka, Tanzania but WFP is attempting to use a supply route by barge from Kigoma, Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reports that of the 62,000 Burundian refugees who have returned to Burundi from Zaire, about 45,000 spontaneously repatriated to Cibitoke province and 15,000 arrived through the Gatumba transit center outside Bujumbura.  WFP is distributing returnee packages to both populations. UNHCR has transported all but 650 of the Gatumba returnees to their home communes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Burundi (HRFOB) visited Cibitoke province on November 21 where they learned of a massacre of Burundian returnees that occurred one month earlier. Reportedly, 258 people were killed immediately, while 40 died later from wounds. Seventy others were wounded. U.N. agencies and NGOs are concerned that returnees are being channelled into Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces, areas where fighting has occurred and aid workers have limited access. HRFOB currently has five human rights observers and two officers providing technical assistance in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania: Tanzanian refugee camps are burgeoning, as a result of influxes from Burundi and from eastern Zaire. WFP reports that new arrivals from Burundi are in poor nutritional state, with a 19% malnutrition rate for children under five years of age recorded in Mtendeli camp. Approximately 1, 200 Rwandan refugees from South Kivu have also arrived in Kigoma. In light of large scale repatriation from Zaire, UNHCR and the Government of Tanzania have increased negotiations with Rwandan refugee populations regarding their return to Rwanda. Some refugees have stated that they will require confirmation that their land is unoccupied prior to returning. On December 3, UNHCR and the Government of Tanzania signed a letter of mutual intent firming up a repatriation strategy for Rwandan refugees. WFP is pre-positioning food commodities in Kibungo, Cyangugu, Gikongoro and Buturare, Rwanda in anticipation of an influx of returnees from Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political/Military Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada has proposed setting up a multinational humanitarian force (MNHF) headquartered in Entebbe, Uganda. Twenty countries, including the United States, support the Canadian plan to conduct reconnaissance flights and plan for airdrops of relief supplies to refugees. Relief agencies have expressed reservations about airdrops, executed in the absence of a team on the ground to clear the drop zone and insure distribution to malnourished refugees and/or IDPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.N. Security Council Resolution 1080, approved on November 15, allows the MNHF to deliver relief to the region and assist in the voluntary repatriation of refugees, and authorizes the deployment of troops under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. The operation is authorized through March 31, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USAID's Administrator Brian Atwood, USAID Chief of Staff Richard McCall, and BHR/OFDA Director Nan Borton attended a donor meeting hosted by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) in Geneva on November 23.  Representatives from donor governments, the GOR, and U.N. agencies met to discuss refugee reintegration in the Great Lakes region, in particular Rwanda.  Participants congratulated the GOR for its success in dealing with the massive and sudden influx or refugees and called on the governments of the region and all parties involved to allow full humanitarian access to refugees and displaced persons in eastern Zaire. Participants also sought to support the GOR in promoting reconciliation and dialogue between all parties and in meeting reintegration and development needs. Top reintegration priorities of the GOR include housing, justice, security, and human resources development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 18, the U.N. announced a Flash Appeal for U.N. programs in Rwanda and eastern Zaire, amounting to $259.5 million. UNHCR issued an appeal on November 19 for $66.9 million to support its emergency operations for refugees and people displaced in the fighting in eastern Zaire and the immediate integration of more than 500,000 returnees in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 15, ICRC launched an appeal for $38.5 million to support its eastern Zaire operation for three months. ICRC has GOZ permission to operate throughout Zaire and has the capacity to provide non-food relief for 525,000 people and food for 250,000 people per month. The GOR has sanctioned U.N.  agencies and ten NGOs to provide cross-border assistance to refugees in eastern Zaire. Approved NGOs include Concern International, MSF/Holland, ARC, Trocaire, Oxfam, SCF/UK, African Humanitarian Action, Merlin, IRC, and Lutheran World Federation (LWF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 26, BHR/OFDA deployed a USAID/DART to Kigali, Rwanda, to conduct assessments, supply information updates, and provide funding to NGOs, U.N.  agencies, and international organizations for programs to assist with repatriation efforts in Rwanda. On November 7, 1996, U.S. Ambassador Robert Gribbin declared a disaster in Rwanda, noting that the refugee crisis in eastern Zaire poses a humanitarian emergency for Rwanda. On November 12, 1996, U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson declared a disaster in Zaire, as a result of the violent break-up of refugee camps in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By November 23, USAID/DART had received 675 rolls of plastic sheeting (sufficient to shelter 12,000 families) and 13,300 blankets, valued at $493, 675, including transport costs. The commodities are consigned to UNHCR.  BHR/OFDA has also shipped 20 complete World Health Organization (WHO) emergency health kits which contain enough medical supplies to assist 200,000 people for three months. The kits are valued at $205,013, including freight costs, and were provided to the Ministry of Health for distribution to health clinics in high impact communes. On November 18, the USG pledged $140 million in humanitarian and development assistance to address needs in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . GREAT LAKES - Complex Emergency Situation Report No. 10 Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, December 5, 1996. Note: The last situation report was dated December 3, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda people, who are Tutsi of Rwandan origin, settled in the Mulenge hills of South Kivu, Zaire, and the Masisi region of North Kivu, Zaire, more than 200 years ago. Sporadic ethnic violence in the Masisi region has occurred since 1959, but it again escalated in the fall of 1995 as the former Rwandan army (the ex-FAR) and the Rwandan Hutu militia (the Interahamwe) targeted Banyarwanda Tutsi in an apparent attempt to create an area of Hutu control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1996, the situation in the Uvira region of South Kivu began to resemble that of the Masisi region, as government-sanctioned harassment of Banyamulenge Tutsis intensified. On October 8, 1996, the South Kivu Deputy Governor declared that Banyamulenge residents should leave the area within seven days or risk treatment as rebels. On October 14, fighting broke out between the Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairian Army (FAZ) near Runingo refugee camp, in South Kivu, forcing the roughly 220,000 refugees to flee.  The Banyamulenge joined forces with other Zairian rebels to form the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), and the fighting spread, moving up the eastern border of Zaire from Uvira to Bukavu, as well as south from Rutshuru (North Kivu) to Goma. As a result of shelling from Rwanda on October 26 and November 1, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kibumba, Katale, and Kahindo camps near Goma, fled to Mugunga camp. Both the ex-FAR and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)- financed Zairian Camp Security Contingent (CZSC), became involved in the fighting. After suffering defeat, the FAZ and CZSC retreated to the west, looting villages and displacing Zairians from Goma town and surrounding areas.  Following Hutu attacks from Mugunga camp on Goma town, the ADFL counter- attacked on November 14, forcing the ex-FAR and Interahamwe to retreat to the west and compelling hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan refugees: An estimated 600,000 Rwandan refugees have returned from the Goma area camps to Rwanda. Tens of thousands of Rwandan refugees from the Bukavu and Uvira camps remain unaccounted for. One thousand Rwandan refugees have been reported in Zambia, as well as 1,200 newly arrived in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian refugees: Of the 143,000 Burundian refugees originally in the Uvira area, UNHCR reports some 62,000 refugees have returned to Burundi and about 13,500 have arrived in Tanzania. The location of the balance from Uvira is unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newly Displaced: Fleeing continued fighting in Burundi, a new caseload of about 73,500 Burundian refugees has entered Tanzania. Approximately 35,000 Zairians have fled to Tanzania. One thousand Zairian Tutsis are reported in Brazzaville, Congo, and 17,000 Zairians are reported in Uganda. The U.S.  Embassy in Zaire estimates that 170,000 Zairians have been displaced by the conflict in eastern Zaire, including 20,000 from Uvira, 60,000 from Bukavu, 40,000 from Goma, and 50,000 from rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unknown Populations: There are an estimated 225,000 to 285,000 people on the move within Zaire. It is uncertain whether these are displaced Zairians, Rwandan or Burundian refugees or former Rwandan militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 3, a United Nations (U.N.)/non- governmental organization (NGO) team gained access to Uvira for the first time since expatriate relief workers evacuated on October 22. The team saw no refugees on the road from Bukavu to Uvira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to UNHCR, some 800 Rwandan refugees crossed into Rwanda from Goma on December 4. Only about 250 refugees crossed at Gomaon December 2 - the slowest day since the massive influxes that began November 15. Returnee registration in the communes is underway and of the 600,000 estimated returnees, UNHCR has registered some 150,000 returnees thus far in 50 communes in six main prefectures and Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repatriation appears to be increasing in the Bukavu region. UNHCR reports that an average of 600- 700 refugees are now crossing daily at Cyangugu.  Since mid-October, about 8,000 refugees have returned through the Bukavu- Cyangugu corridor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political/Military Situation Clashes continue in eastern Zaire, between ADFL and FAZ forces. The ADFL claims to have captured towns at the northern and southern ends of a 250 mile front. Reports that the ADFL captured Kindu and parts of Kisangani do not appear accurate. The U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA) reports that the situation in Kisangani has become increasingly volatile. Some 400 Zairian soldiers remain in Kisangani after fleeing the rebel advance in north Kivu and shooting and looting are common occurrences. Uvira and Bukavu remain calm and under Banyamulenge control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1080, the U.S. Government (USG) plans to participate in a multinational effort, led by Canada, to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the voluntary, orderly repatriation of refugees. The USG has helped to locate groups of refugees and displaced persons in eastern Zaire using aerial surveys and other means to gain accurate and complete information. The USG and others are working with the Canadians to plan for airdrops of emergency food to stranded refugees if necessary. Relief agencies have expressed reservations about airdrops, executed in the absence of a team on the ground to clear the drop zone and insure distribution to malnourished refugees and/or internally displaced persons (IDPs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts Donors and humanitarian agencies are providing relief and rehabilitation assistance to returnees in accordance with the Government of Rwanda (GOR) plan, which was agreed upon at a conference hosted by the Canadian International Development Agency in Geneva on November 23.  Participants agreed to support the GOR in promoting reconciliation and dialogue between all parties and in meeting reintegration and development needs, including housing, justice, security, and human resources development.  Participants also called on governments of the region and all parties involved to allow full humanitarian access to refugees and displaced persons in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 18, the U.N. announced a Flash Appeal for U.N. programs in Rwanda and eastern Zaire, amounting to $259.5 million. UNHCR issued an appeal on November 19 for $66.9 million to support its emergency operations for refugees and people displaced in the fighting in eastern Zaire and the immediate integration of more than 500,000 returnees in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 15, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) launched an appeal for $38.5 million to support its eastern Zaire operation for three months. ICRC has Government of Zaire (GOZ) permission to operate throughout Zaire and has the capacity to provide non-food relief for 525,000 people and food for 250,000 people per month. The GOR has sanctioned U.N.  agencies and ten NGOs to provide cross-border assistance to refugees in eastern Zaire. Approved NGOs include Concern International, Medicins Sans Frontieres/Holland (MSF/Holland), American Refugee Committee (ARC), Trocaire, Oxfam, Save the Children Fund/UK (SCF/UK), African Humanitarian Action, Merlin, International Rescue Committee (IRC), and Lutheran World Federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uvira: The first humanitarian team to enter Uvira since October 22 met with de facto authorities on December 3 and visited the town. They found that the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) and UNHCR offices and warehouses had been looted. Access to the port was denied but the two cranes were reportedly intact. Uvira town is calm and markets have re-opened and are well-stocked.  The nearby refugee camps are deserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bukavu: UNHCR is planning for the possible return of 30,000 Rwandan refugees through the Bukavu/Cyangugu corridor and for some 25,000 Zairian IDPs who are making their way to Bukavu. In preparation, NGOs have established four way stations to provide water and medical assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reports that the search for refugees in Bukavu is hampered by restrictions on staff movements to a 30 km radius of the town center. Relief efforts are confined to helping refugees emerging from forests who gather at a center near the Bukavu airport. Trucks then transport the refugees to the Rwandan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs currently working in Bukavu include Concern International, MSF/International, IRC, SCF/UK, Christian Aid, Oxfam, and Caritas. U.N agencies and ICRC are also working in Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goma: On November 27, a convoy of relief agencies found some 40,000 Rwandan refugees in fairly good health in Minova, located about 35 km southwest of Goma. On November 28, some of these refugees began moving towards Goma.  Relief agencies set up way stations between Minova and Goma to distribute high protein biscuits and to provide water, sanitation, and health care and an estimated 20,000 crossed the border from November 29 - 30. Relief agencies have been denied access to Minova since November 29 due to fighting in the area, but distribution of biscuits continues at way stations in Sake, Mugunga, and Kulungu. Fighting has reportedly pushed those remaining in the Minova area westward further into Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nyamulagira volcano, north of Goma near the Kitale and Kahindo camps, erupted on December 1. As the camps are empty, the lava flow slow- moving, and the area sparsely populated, no populations were reportedly endangered by the eruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following relief organizations are currently operating in Goma: ARC, Merlin, Trocaire, SCF/UK, Concern International, Catholic Relief Services (CRS)/Caritas, Oxfam, MSF/I, ICRC, UNHCR, and WFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kisangani: Access to the internally displaced populations in this area is now hindered as a result of insecurity. Aviation Sans Frontieres pulled out of the area after its aircraft came under fire on December 2 and ICRC has withdrawn staff from both Kisangani and Kindu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda: UNHCR states that nearly all the returnees have arrived in their home communes. UNHCR reports that the returnees are in good condition in general and in some of the communes are placed temporarily in a transit center until they are registered. After registration, they collect a seven- day food ration and will eventually receive monthly rations. From November 17- 28, WFP pre-positioned 3,454 metric tons (MT) of food commodities in Byumba, Gisenyi, Gitarama, Kibungo, Kibuye, Kigali (Rural and Ville), Nyagatare and Ruhengeri prefectures, representing approximately 890,000 weekly rations.  UNICEF provides 100 grams of blended food supplement to all children under five years of age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOR Ministry of Rehabilitation and Social Integration reported on November 25 that there were 135,000 families without shelter in rural areas and 65,000 families in urban areas, of which about 20% are in Kigali. Some returnees find their homes occupied by squatters when they return. The GOR has given squatters two weeks to vacate dwellings belonging to returnees and has set up temporary transit centers to house returnees and displaced residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) reported on November 28 that the GOR has arrested 38 returnees in Byumba, Gisenyi, Kigali Rural and Ville, and Ruhengeri prefectures for involvement in the 1994 genocide. HRFOR has called for thorough investigations into disturbing reports of several incidents of Rwandan returnees killing genocide survivors.  Currently there are 134 U.N. human rights observers in Rwanda, of which 15 are undergoing training. Another 15 are due to arrive shortly. HRFOR issued an appeal to fund a total of 300 human rightsmonitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCF/UK and ICRC have registered a total of 5,500 unaccompanied children in Rwanda. Of these, 1,000 have been reunified with family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi: WFP's request to the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee to import 2,500 MT of food per month for a caseload of 130,000 people has been approved. To date, importation has only been possible by road from Isaka, Tanzania but WFP is attempting to use a supply route by barge from Kigoma, Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reports that of the 62,000 Burundian refugees who have returned to Burundi from Zaire, about 45,000 spontaneously repatriated to Cibitoke province and 15,000 arrived through the Gatumba transit center outside Bujumbura. WFP is distributing returnee packages to both populations. UNHCR has transported all but 650 of the Gatumba returnees to their home communes.  A joint U.N./NGO mission to Kinama commune in Bujumbura Rural province found that many returnees are coming home to find their houses either destroyed or occupied by others. A second mission on November 22 to Mutimbuzi commune in the same province found that returnees lacked seeds and farming implements needed for the upcoming planting season. Returnees in both communes had limited access to health care, a problem faced by many in Burundi. Members of the U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Burundi (HRFOB) visited Cibitoke province on November 21 where they learned of a massacre of almost 300 Burundian returnees that occurred one month earlier. HRFOB currently has five human rights observers and two officers providing technical assistance in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania: Tanzanian refugee camps are burgeoning, as a result of influxes from Burundi and from eastern Zaire. WFP reports that new arrivals from Burundi are in poor nutritional state, with a 19% malnutrition rate for children under five years of age recorded in Mtendeli camp. WFP is sending additional quantities of corn-soy blend to the Kigoma region for supplementary feeding programs. Approximately 1,200 Rwandan refugees from South Kivu have also arrived in Kigoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of large scale repatriation from Zaire, the Government of Tanzania has called for the repatriation of all Rwandan refugees by December 31. Some refugees have stated that they will require confirmation that their land is unoccupied prior to returning. On December 3, UNHCR and the Government of Tanzania signed a letter of mutual intent firming up a repatriation strategy for Rwandan refugees. Inside Rwanda, planning is underway to prepare for a return. UNHCR will work with NGOs to establish way stations every six kilometers on the road from the border and WFP is pre-positioning food commodities in key return prefectures. UNHCR reports that 230 Rwandan refugees returned from Tanzania on December 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Assistance On October 26, BHR/OFDA deployed a disaster assistance response team (USAID/DART) to Kigali, Rwanda, to conduct assessments, supply information updates, and provide funding to NGOs, U.N. agencies, and international organizations for programs to assist with repatriation efforts.  On November 7, 1996, U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda, Robert Gribbin, declared a disaster, noting that the refugee crisis in eastern Zaire poses a humanitarian emergency for Rwanda. On November 12, 1996, U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson declared a disaster in Zaire, as a result of the violent break- up of refugee camps in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BHR/OFDA provided 675 rolls of plastic sheeting (sufficient to shelter 12, 000 families) and 13,300 blankets to UNHCR/Kigali. BHR/OFDA has also shipped 20 World Health Organization (WHO) emergency health kits which contain enough medical supplies to assist 200,000 people for three months to the Ministry of Health for distribution to health clinics in high impact communes. On November 18, the USG pledged $140 million in humanitarian and development assistance to address needs in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has seconded staff to UNHCR/Rwanda, UNHCR/Tanzania, and to WHO in Kigali to provide epidemiologic and public health assistance to refugees and others displaced by the recent conflict in eastern Zaire. CDC staff will also participate in short term assessments health performed by IRC and IFRC in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairperson, Truth And Reconciliation Commission, December 8, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If General Magnus Malan is correctly reported in today's Rapport, he has fundamental misunderstandings about the law which established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and he is giving dangerously misleading advice to those who served under him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Malan has reportedly said to those who are uncertain about where they stand that it is not necessary to apply for amnesty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My advice is: If you are uncertain about whether or not your actions could lead to a prosecution, or a civil action for damages, the safest course is to apply for amnesty. You have nothing to lose: the details of your amnesty application cannot be used against you in a court of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If correctly quoted, General Malan is wrong in the following respects:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- He suggests that people can be charged before the TRC. That is not the case: people come before the Commission to seek amnesty, not to be punished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- He suggests that cross-examination of witnesses in a court serves former SADF members' interests better than TRC proceedings. But the Amnesty Committee's proceedings are not based on witnesses giving evidence against an applicant; they are based on applicants voluntarily telling the Committee the truth about what they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- He says you can get amnesty only if you say you are sorry. There is no such requirement in the law and that is not the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Malan also says he takes political responsibility for cross-border raids and individuals do not have to apply for amnesty. But the amnesty provisions of the law do not allow for the concept of collective responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former SADF members who are vulnerable to prosecution or civil actions are being badly advised by General Malan. If they follow his advice and do not take advantage of the opportunity offered by the Commission, they may be charged by Attorneys-General or sued by victims.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - AN OPEN APPEAL TO POLITICAL LEADERS AND POTENTIAL AMNESTY APPLICANTS from Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Chairperson, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, December 9, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most significant dates in the life of the Commission -- the deadline for the submission of amnesty applications -- is less than a week away. There still appear, however, to be a number of misunderstandings about the amnesty process, which are shared by some political leaders or former leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The confusion, particularly so close to the deadline date, could seriously undermine the potential of the amnesty process to help us reach the truth and thereby to bring about reconciliation in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the confusion centres on two issues:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--- Many appear uncertain about whether or not they should be applying for amnesty;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--- There is a widespread misconception that the only people who need to apply for amnesty are those who committed gross human rights violations as defined in the Act, or who acted outside the authority of the State or the policies of their political movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the first issue, we have had appeals -- from political leaders among others -- for advice about whether people should apply for amnesty. There has even been a suggestion that we should set up a service for those who are uncertain, the purpose being to give advice on whether or not they should apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot give advice to individuals on whether or not the specific actions they have been involved in are actions in respect of which they should apply for amnesty. Giving such advice would involve pre-empting the role of the Attorneys-General by saying whether or not people might be charged for such actions. It would also involve pre-empting the courts by saying whether or not people who were charged would be convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, we can say to individuals only that they should apply for amnesty if they have done something which might result in a prosecution or a civil action for damages. We cannot give them a firm assurance that their actions fall in that category or not. Instead we urge them to realise that people who do not apply for amnesty do so at their own peril. They may be criminally charged or be liable for civil damages. If they are in doubt it is obviously better to be safe and to apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second issue is rooted in the mistaken importance that has been attached to moral issues in the amnesty process. The Act is very clear that amnesty is for anyone who has done, or omitted to do, anything which might constitute an offence or a delict. The moral quality of the act is irrelevant for the purposes of the Amnesty Committee. To apply for amnesty is not necessarily to admit you have done something wrong: indeed, you are able to tell the Amnesty Committee that you are proud of what you did, albeit that it constitutes an offence under law. There is no requirement in the law that a mnesty applicants should express remorse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only relevance which the definition of a &quot;gross violation of human rights&quot; has in the amnesty provisions of the Act is to the question of whether there is a public hearing or not. Amnesty is not only for those who have committed gross violations of human rights. Misconceptions on this issue can be gravely prejudicial to individuals. One example is Mr P W Botha's statement that he is advised that the bombing of Khotso House is not a &quot;gross violation of human rights&quot; as defined in the Act. This statement could lead people who were involved in bombings of buildings where there was no loss of life to assume that they need not apply for amnesty. Yet, accepting for the purposes of argument that such an action is not a gross violation, the bombing of a building is certainly something that can be the subject of criminal charges. It is therefore critically important to take the definition of &quot;gross violations&quot; out of consideration when it comes to the amnesty process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There also appears to be a belief that amnesty is only for those who have committed acts which fall outside officially-sanctioned orders or policy. Yet Section 20 (2) of the Act specifically envisages amnesty, for example, for a member of the Security forces for actions carried out &quot;in the course and scope of his or her duties and within the scope of his or her express or implied authority ... and which was committed bona fide with the object of countering or otherwise resisting (a political struggle against the State)...&quot; It similarly envisages amnesty for a member of a liberation movement involved in actions &quot;in the course and scope of his or her duties and within the scope of his or her express or implied authority directed against the State... and which was committed bona fide in furtherance of the said struggle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this which led me to advise members of the Security forces in a statement to a newspaper recently:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just as we would urge members of liberation movements in general to apply for amnesty for officially-approved attacks, planned from outside the country, against military targets in South Africa, we would urge members of the Security forces in general to apply for amnesty in respect of cross-border operations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political leaders have a critical role in ensuring that the country exploits to the full the potential that the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act offers for getting to the truth about our past and using it as a basis for promoting reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot force anyone to apply for amnesty; the process is voluntary. And amnesty applications are not necessarily essential to our purposes in our search for the truth: indeed, on the basis of the work of our Investigative Unit and Research Department we are hopeful that we will get to a substantial part of the truth -- including identifying key figures -- even without amnesty applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, we believe our political leaders will be squandering an important opportunity for putting the past behind them if they do not come forward and participate in the amnesty process. There is no instrument in the country with the same potential as this process for ending the accusations and counter-accusations about the past, the recriminations and the political bickering which will plague this country's life for generations to come if you do not seize the opportunity of using properly the Commission which you created.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - This is number 38 (2 - 8 December) in a series of weekly reports from IRIN on general developments in the Great Lakes region. Sources for the information below include UN agencies, NGOs, other international organisations and media reports. IRIN issues these reports for the benefit of the humanitarian community, but accepts no responsibility as to the accuracy of the original sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Reports that the rebels in eastern Zaire had taken control of Bunia, Kindu and Kisangani appear to have been premature. At present, it is clear that the rebels have retained control of Uvira, Bukavu and Goma, where daily life is reported to be returning to normal. They also control Beni, which fell on 30 November. The Zairean authorities accused Uganda of having assisted the rebels in Beni, but the Ugandan Government denied the charge, saying that its troops had only gone to Kasindi (just over the Uganda-Zaire border), in pursuit of Ugandan rebels which had been using the town as their base.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a briefing for humanitarian agencies in Nairobi on Thursday, Lt Gen Maurice Baril said that aerial surveillance by the multi-national forces (MNF) found no more than 165,000 refugees or displaced people in a 150-km wide stretch of North and South Kivu. The largest group was of 150,000 refugees around Numbi, south west of Goma, but subsequent reports over the weekend suggest this group may be breaking up. Lt Gen Baril also reported that a group of Interahamwe and ex-FAR have been sighted near the town of Walikale, while about 30,000 people believed to be ex-FAR have moved out of range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agencies, meanwhile, have expressed concern about 'missing' Rwandan and Burundian refugees as well as Zairean internally displaced people. The US gives a high estimate that 650,000 Rwandan refugees have returned to Rwanda from Zaire, while 60,000 Burundian refugees are known to have returned to Burundi. Given that the original number of Rwandan refugees in Zaire was believed to be around 1.2 million, with another 140,000 Burundian refugees, this would suggest that some 440,000 Rwandan and 80,000 Burundian refugees remain in Zaire. Meanwhile, the death toll as a result of the fighting in eastern Zaire has been estimated as at least 2,754, according to the Emergency Biodiversity Team (EUB), who have taken responsibility for burying the bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian agencies now have a presence in Goma and Bukavu towns, but have little access to surrounding areas. On Tuesday a group of agencies (UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF, DHA, MSF, ICRC and IFRC) were able to visit Uvira from Bukavu, the first such visit since international staff evacuated on 22 October. They reported that Uvira town was calm, markets had re-opened, and the hospital was functioning relatively normally, but that aid agency offices had been extensively looted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, expectations of an intervention by the MNF have dimmed. Canada's Defence Minister Doug Young suggested on Friday that the mass return of refugees to Rwanda had vitiated the need for a military intervention; both he and Lt General Baril have also expressed serious doubts about air drops into eastern Zaire, arguing that they should be a last resort. France, meanwhile, reiterated its support for a multi- national force on Sunday, contradicting comments by Jacques Godfrain, Cooperation Minister, who earlier said it was no longer necessary. In a communique the French Ministry of External Affairs said, 'France's position on the implementation of United Nations resolutions on Zaire, notbaly on the deployment of a multinational force, has not changed'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the political level, Zairean premier Kengo wa Dondo on Tuesday accused Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi of setting up a 'Tutsi empire' and expressed his support for a multi-national force to help Rwandan refugees, at the Congo summit for central african leaders. UN Secretary-General Dr Boutros Boutros- Ghali also reiterated his support for a military intervention last week.  Raymond Chretien met President Mobutu in southern France on Wednesday, and declared that 'Zaire is ready to play its role again and does not intend to use a 'empty chair' policy'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The UNHRFOR has issued a report on the reintegration of Rwandan refugees from Zaire into their home communes stating that, 'Overall the mass movement of returnees from the border to their home communes proceeded smoothly and returnees were generally well-received in their communes of origin.' HRFOR states that as of 1 December, 322,964 new returnees are reported to have arrived in their communes of origin and to have been registered by civilian authorities with UNHCR assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But HRFOR expressed concern about 'the absence of definitive figures on the number of returnees from Zaire since 15 November', noting that this will 'impede considerably the verification of the their arrival in communes of origin'. The UNHCR estimates that around 550,000 Rwandan refugees returned from Zaire during the second half of November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HRFOR report states that 162 newly-arrived returnees are reported to have been arrested or detained, while some 4,331 members of the ex-FAR were registered by either military or civilian authorities. Twelve members of the ex-FAR have been arrested. HRFOR also received reports of four separate incidents resulting in the killing of four returnees and two persons associated with them, while also receiving reports that four genocide survivors and two persons associated with them were killed in Gisenyi Prefecture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan justice minister Faustin Nteziryayo met the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, on Saturday to discuss the human rights situation in the country following the mass return of refugees, with the justice minister briefing the high commissioner on measures taken by Rwanda to improve human rights conditions. A meeting on the relief needs of Rwandan returnees will be held on December 13 and 14 in Kigali and will be co-chaired by Canada and Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rwanda has published a list of nearly 1,900 people is accuses of organising and leading the genocide in 1994. The names, which are in alphabetical order and listed by commune and prefecture, are of people suspected of 'first degree' involvement in the genocide, making them liable to the death penalty under the terms of new legislation. The list, published last week, includes former ministers, politicians, regional officials, military officers and Hutu militia leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) last week beat off an attack by rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces, who invaded near the border town of Bwera on Wednesday. According to reports in the Government-owned New Vision, people from the area said that 100 rebels had crossed from Zaire. Later reports claimed that 50 rebels were killed in the subsequent fighting, while five UPDF soldiers and eight civilians were injured. The UPDF counter-attack involved them in pursuing the rebels to Kasindi, in Zairean territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the week Zaire accused the Ugandan army of involvement in the war in Kivu and called on the UN to stop Uganda's armed incursions. In a statement to the Security Council, signed by Zaire's deputy premier Kamanda wa Kamanda and dated 1 December, Zaire accused the Ugandan army of 'involvement in the war which Rwanda is imposing on Zaire' and said that because of its involvement Uganda should be disqualified from serving as a base for the multi-national force. Zaire also denied that it was supporting Ugandan rebels of the Allied Democratic Front (ADF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Major General David Tinyefuza, Uganda's presidential adviser on defence, is reported to have resigned after making highly critical comments about the Government's handling of the war in the north before a Parliamentary Committee. Tinyefuza said Ugandans should call for a referendum on the future of the Government 'if it fails to end the war militarily within a month.' He said that if the war couldn't be ended in that time the Government had to talk to Joseph Kony, leader of the Lords Resistance Army (LRA). Saying that the war was an 'economic disaster' for Uganda, he described as 'rubbish' claims by some politicians that Kony was not a serious threat. His comments are reported to have incensed senior army officers and he is believed to have been called before a disciplinary hearing before he handed in his resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A different view was expressed last week by Lt-Col Toolit, director of military intelligence, who was also appearing before the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs, which is investigating the war in the north. According to a report on Radio Uganda monitored by the BBC, Lt-Col Toolit said that the war will only come to an end if the politicians and the population come out in unity to denounce rebel activities. Commenting on peace talks as a solution to the war, Lt-Col Toolit said they would only help Joseph Kony to reorganize his acts of banditry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* LRA rebels killed 10 people last week in villages near the northern town of Gulu, according to a report in the New Vision today. The report claimed that four people had been battered to death with hoes, apparently in retaliation for their moving closer to military camps for protection. Several civilians and one Ugandan soldier were also reported to have been abducted by the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UNHCR and Tanzania began a campaign on Friday urging Rwandan refugees in the camps to return by the end of the year. The message to the 535,000 refugees is being broadcast on local radio, circulated in leaflets in Kinyarwanda and read by workers using loudspeakers. Two way stations are being established on the 30 km road between the camps and the border and there will also be four water points, which will be used to gather children separated from their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total number of people who returned in November was 548; but in recent days numbers have risen substantially. On Tuesday last week 238 refugees returned and on Thursday 274. A statement by the Tanzanian Government and UNHCR encouraging refugees to return has been criticized by UNHCR, who said 'it makes no mention of options for those refugees who continue to fear human rights violations on returning to Rwanda'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, 15,000 refugees reported to have left the Kagenyi and Rubwere camps in Karagwe region between Friday and Sunday night are reported to have headed north and east instead of west back to Rwanda. Some media accounts report aid workers as having put forward the theory that Hutu hardliners may be organising mass departures in response to the repatriation preparations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania hosts about 720,000 refugees, of whom 530,000 are Rwandan and 190, 000 Burundian. During November there was a dramatic escalation in the number of refugees arriving in Kigoma, when 100,000 refugees came in, the majority from Burundi. Some of the recent arrivals are Zaireans who have fled the conflict in eastern Zaire, coming by boat across Lake Tanganyika.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The sanctions against Burundi will be the subject of talks to be held in Nairobi next week between Burundi's nighbouring countries, according to a report in the East African. The paper reported Tanzanian Government sources as saying that there is pressure from all over the region to lift the sanctions. Last week a summit meeting for central african leaders in Brazzaville, Congo, called for the lifting of the sanctions, while a meeting of leaders at a Franco-African summit in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, also demanded the lifting of the embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent FAO report on the crop and food supply situation in Burundi has drawn attention to the effects of the conflict and the embargo on the country.  FAO estimates the food shortfall in 1996 at 53,000 tons of cereals, 69,000 tons of pulses, 181,000 tons of roots and tubers and 123,000 tons of bananas and plantains. Dry spells in April and May and the conflict in Bubanza, Cibitoke and Karuzi provinces - which reduced crop production in these provinces by as much as 50% - are blamed for the shortfalls. The report states that, '(A)s a result of the embargo on food imports, the nutritional status of the population in general and of the internally displaced people and dispersed populations in particular, is likely to be seriously affected.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP has also drawn attention to the extremely serious consequences of the conflict in Burundi, stating that a 'dramatic escalation' of the conflict has doubled the number of internally displaced people in Burundi to about 80,000 in the past few weeks. The statement followed WFP's announcement that it has been allowed to resume food deliveries to Burundi, following a decision by the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee. WFP will now be able to deliver 2,545 tonnes of food aid each month, enough to feed 130,000 people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - ICRC said its team in eastern Zaire, which was forced to evacuate Kindu and Kisangani last week because of insecurity, managed to fly to Shabunda on Sunday from Lubumbashi. Between 8,000 and 10,000 Burundian and Rwandan refugees, from the Uvira camps, were located in the area, most of them in a very bad condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were suffering mainly from diarrhoea, malnutrition and malaria. ICRC said there were indications that large groups of women, children and elderly people were in the surrounding forests living in difficult conditions.  Emergency food aid was being flown into the area as of today and ICRC said it would concentrate on the refugees it had located. ICRC added however that it did not want its activities to favour the establishment of new camps, and it was discussing the future of these people with the local authorities and UNHCR. A UN interagency mission just returned to Kinshasa from Shabunda reports a similar picture, having visited small camps of refugees at Nialubwe near Shabunda. Several Rwandan refugees interviewed by a UN official during the mission expressed a willingness to go home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo has stated that his country's armed forces &quot;have lost the battle but not the war&quot;. In an interview with Radio France Internationale, broadcast yesterday, he said Zaire would do everything in its power to regain &quot;its occupied territories&quot;. &quot;The Zairean armed forces have withdrawn at the moment... Soon you will see what these Zairean armed forces are capable of when motivated by the love of their country,&quot; he told the radio. He described rebel leader Laurent Kabila as a &quot;puppet of the Rwandans&quot;, and ruled out any negotiations with the rebels. &quot;The war has not been won,&quot; he added. &quot;No-one can celebrate a victory at the moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila meanwhile said the Zairean army was facing &quot;total disaster&quot;.  According to rebel Radio of the People yesterday, monitored by the BBC, he said 350 soldiers had gone over to the side of the rebels. The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), he said, was ready to negotiate with &quot;all those in favour of a democratic and republican system&quot;, but he would never work with Mobutu. However, Zairean Information Minister Makeli Boguo denied that soldiers had defected to the rebels, saying the claim was part of the rebels' &quot;psychological battle&quot;. &quot;I would have liked us to be told where and how many,&quot; he told Radio France Internationale. &quot;All we are told is that 300 soldiers are reported to have gone over to the enemy forces. According to military sources, this report is untrue and is being spread about simply to sap the morale of our soldiers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boguo also strongly denied that the town of Bunia had fallen to the rebels, despite repeated claims by rebel security chief Jean Kabongo that the town was in ADFL hands. NGOs, with contacts on the ground, confirmed that Bunia had not been taken, and said more Zairean soldiers had turned up in the town where they continued to loot property and possessions. Seven soldiers were reported killed by Bunia residents who are said to be increasingly fed up with the state of lawlessness in their town. A demonstration, by mostly young people, was held over the weekend in protest against the current state of affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some reports said Bunia was surrounded by rebels, backed by fighters from the Mai Mai militia of the Hunde tribe. According to a Reuters report, Mai Mai child warriors captured the village of Mambasa on Sunday, effectively cutting off Bunia and some 5,000 Zairean soldiers there from any escape route.  The news agency quoted the local operations head of the Zaire Red Cross in Beni as saying the rebels were taking advantage of the Mai Mai who believe the power of water will protect them from harm, including bullets. Reuters said the ADFL had trucked thousands of Mai Mai to the frontline near Bunia, as a psychological weapon against Zairean forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One French and two Belgian employees at a mine in eastern Zaire were reportedly held hostage for three days by Burundian Hutu rebels in the Kamituga area. According to Reuters, Sylvain Bogaertss, the Belgian director of works at the Sominki gold mine in Kamituga said on Friday they were surrounded by about 20 Burundian rebels and taken away. &quot;They were desperate men with nothing to lose. They said they were going to kill us,&quot; he said.  They were freed separately after a large but undisclosed ransom was negotiated, Reuters said. It added that Burundian rebel groups have been driven from bases inside Zaire in areas bordering Burundi, by Zairean rebel advances in the east of the country. Their supply lines from Bukavu to the Rusizi plain, have been cut. Like their armed Hutu counterparts from Rwanda, many have now been driven into the interior of Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are indications that some refugees who fled camps in Tanzania's Karagwe region rather than be repatriated to Rwanda are returning to the original camps, signifying that intimidators - thought to be preventing the repatriation - may be losing their hold. UNHCR said several of the 15,000 refugees who left Kagenyi and Rubwere camps over the weekend had now returned.  A report from the office of the Humanitarian Coordinator in Kigali said 30 trucks were able to cross from Rwanda into Tanzania today in readiness for the repatriation exercise, and another 60 UNHCR/IOM trucks were on their way to the border. Today, 1,387 Rwandans returned from Tanzania, bringing the total of returnees since 1 December to over 3,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio France Internationale reported today that President Mobutu would return to Zaire early next week. It said it had obtained the information exclusively from Mobutu's chief aide, Honore Ngbanda. Mobutu has been in France convalescing from cancer surgery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International today accused the Zairean authorities and ADFL rebels of clamping down on human rights activities in the Bukavu area. It said that since September many human rights activists had been killed, attacked, imprisoned or had disappeared. In its statement, the organisation said it had received many &quot;alarming reports&quot; on the difficult conditions faced by activists to investigate and publicise cases of human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 14-nation steering group overseeing the multi-national force (MNF) is due to meet in New York on Friday, a Canadian government source said. Quoted by AFP, he said no timetable had been set for the meeting which will be held at UN headquarters. There has been much speculation of late about the future of the mission with prospective participants questioning whether or not it should be scrapped.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - On 10 December, the international human rights day, the international community should support the daily and determined struggle of human rights defenders in Zaire, Amnesty International said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South-Kivu region's capital, Bukavu which has become since 1990 the home to a flourishing civil society movement, has been subjected to a clamp down on human rights activists by the Zairian authorities. Since September, many of them have been killed, &quot;disappeared&quot;, attacked or imprisoned either by members of the Zairian security forces or by members of the armed group the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, (AFDL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many human rights groups are involved in educating the public about their civil and political rights which have been systematically violated by the political, security and judicial authorities for decades. However, despite threats and continuous harassment, they have not stopped their activities in documenting and denouncing abuses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International has received many alarming reports on the difficult conditions that the human rights defenders face in their effort to investigate and publicize cases of human rights abuses committed by both the Zairian authorities and armed groups. Since September 1996, several members of a church-based human rights and conflict resolution group Heritiers de la Justice, Heirs of Justice, working in South-Kivu have been threatened by the Zairian security forces for criticizing human rights violations in the region.  Furthermore, members of the AFDL have reportedly carried out executions of actual and potential critics such as the Archbishop of Bukavu who was killed in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body of Jean-Bosco Bahati, a member of Heirs of Justice, was found with the bodies of his wife and children towards the end of October . It is unclear if he was killed by the Zairian armed forces or by members of AFDL.  Jean Marie Kati-Kati, the president of GRACE, a group of para-jurists based in Goma was shot by armed groups. He lost his wife and children in the attack.  Professor Wasso, an outspoken critic of human rights abuses, has also reportedly been killed. Amnesty International is investigating all these cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Jean-Paul Simbizi , a member of the human rights group, Justice et Liberation, Justice and Liberation, was ill-treated by students and detained by members of the Zairian security forces. His present whereabouts are still not known. Amnesty international is concerned that he may have &quot;disappeared&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emmanuel Lubala, a lawyer and president of Heritiers de la Justice has been forced into hiding in Kinshasa after fleeing in late October from eastern Zaire; members of the Service d'action et de renseignements militaires (SARM), Military action and Intelligence Service, have been searching for him and is being persecuted because of his human rights and professional activities on behalf of Tutsi. Amnesty International is concerned that he may be subjected to arbitrary arrest or ill-treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because they hid Tutsi in their houses when AFDL took Goma, many human rights defenders, like Bushoki Batabiha, were threatened. Amnesty International is extremely concerned about his fate. The organization believes that he is in hiding, but away from Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July and August, members of a non-governmental organization in Kamituga, Mwenga district, the Collectif d'action pour le developpement des droits de l'homme, (CADDHOM), Collective of Actions for Human Rights Development, including the General Coordinator of this organization, Didi Mwati Bulambo, were arrested following a series of articles criticizing corruption in the Procuracy at Kamituga. Before being released, some of them were severely beaten. Their office was also closed down by members of the armed forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Human rights protection should be at the heart of all attempts to resolve the crisis in eastern Zaire. A strong international presence in the area is needed to protect people at risk, including human rights defenders,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - NEW ARRESTS : Two editors of the Amharic WEEKLY and MONTHLY TOBIYA were locked up during the last five days by the Ethiopian security police for reasons not disclosed so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAYE BELATCHEW, the editor-in-chief of the publications was taken for detention from his office, Friday 22nd November, 1996, in the afternoon. The deputy Editor-in-chief, ANNTENEH MERID was arrested on 25th of November, 1996.  Two senior editors of TOBIYA are being held in custody at the MA'EKELAWI, the Central Criminal Investigation Office, in Addis Abeba. For TAYE BELATCHEW, this was the third arrest and detention within a period of less than two years. On each occasion he was held at police prisons for over a month, and was released on bail totalling 20,000 Birr.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His professional colleague ANTENNEH MERID is also under arrest for second time in a year. He has already been charged for an alleged criminal offence, after over a month detention without trial and his case is still pending at the Federal High Court. The charge was regarding an article published in the Monthly TOBIYA under the title &quot;ORGANIZED POPULAR NON-VIOLENT RESISTANCE AGAINST ORGANISAED RULE BY TERROR! Taye Belatchew has never been formally charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two editors are in their later thirties, married and with children!  Their lengthy detention without trial, coupled with the absence of the manager of the publishing firm, Mullugeta Lule, currently on a private visit to USA, is feared here, might lead to a closure of the publications. It has been a well established practice of the state bureaucracy here to kill WEEKLIES and MONTHLIES of the Independent Press through various process of detention, harassment and intimidation. We are, therefore, appealing to all friends of the FREE PRESS, here at home and abroad, to take immediate action to obtain the unconditional release of all the journalists under detention without trial, including TAYE BELATCHEW and ANTENNEH MERID and to save the popular Weekly and Monthly from the imminent danger of collapsing under the current repression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RECENT RELEASE: ABINET TAMIRAT, EIC of DAGMAWI, was released on 13th November 1996, after remaining in detention for 54 weeks without court conviction. GIRMAYENEH MAMMO, ex-EIC of TOMAR, was released on 7th November 1996. He was sentenced for a year but remained in prison for 13 months. He was arrested on 20th October 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RECENT FINES: ex-EIC and DEPUTY EIC of the Amharic Weekly URGI, TESFAYE DERESSA and GARUMA BEKELE, were fined each 4,000 Birr for publishing allegedly criminal news stories and articles concerning mainly armed guerilla activities of the Oromo Liberation Front, OLF in the Oromiya region !</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia's former foreign minister, Vernon Mwaanga, has sued Newsweek International for 50,000 U.S. dollars as compensation for libel and damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magazine carried a story in 1994 in which it had implied that Mwaanga had recruited people at the ministry of foreign affairs to operate as drug agents and was using his position as minister to facilitate a drug syndicate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwaanga said in Lusaka Monday that the legal battle against the magazine was expected to take off on Jan. 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that he had decided to take legal action against the magazine so that it retracts the story and pays compensation for the damage it had caused to his reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correspondence between his lawyers and Newsweek indicate that Mwaanga is asking to be paid 50,000 dollars as compensation for damages, but the magazine has offered an out of court settlement of 10,000 dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For me really it is not the money that matters but for my name to be cleared of these allegations and in that regard I have asked Newsweek International to retract what they had printed about me,&quot; Mwaanga said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwaanga, together with the former Zambian speaker of parliament, Sikota Wina, and his wife Nakatindi Wina, who was community development minister, were forced to step down in 1994, amid accusations of drug-dealing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that time, several international financial institutions had threatened to withhold their aid unless the Zambian president dealt with the problem of drug trafficking among highly-placed officials of his government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidents of Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon and Mali were dispatched by the Franco-African summit, which was held at Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation secured the truce on Sunday after talks with President Ange- Felix Patasse and the rebels who had been calling for his resignation, among other demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press release, the OAU expressed ardent hope that the truce will lead in the shortest time possible to a durable agreement for the definitive resolution to the present crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization reiterated its support for the on-going mediation efforts by the four African countries and said it was closely following up the situation as it unfolds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SINGAPORE, Singapore (PANA) - The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, has urged African countries to continue implementing policies to reduce bloated budget deficits and encourage domestic savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told ZIANA in Singapore that it had been proved the world over that high fiscal deficits retarded economic growth, and unless controlled, only prolonged the hardships of vulnerable groups already suffering under harsh market reforms being implemented in some countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his organisation would be willing to give expert advice to those African countries willing to listen and implement practical measures aimed at promoting growth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are working together with the World Bank trying to create conditions for growth for countries in Africa. This requires implementation of policies that have been successful in other countries in similar kinds of situations,&quot; Camdessus said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we look at policies that have been successful, they are policies where governments are trying to reduce their deficits in order to open some opportunities to encourage savings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maintaining deficits exceeding 10 percent of gross domestic product, he said, would not make it possible to sustain, let alone promote, economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe, which embarked on wide-based market reforms in 1991, has disappointed major donors such as the IMF by its failure to reduce the budget deficit to a sustainable level of five percent of GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fiscal indiscipline, which saw the deficit in 1995 shoot up to 10 percent, led to the suspension of balance-of-payments credit from the IMF worth over 100 million U.S.dollars in September, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the government has made attempts to cut spending in non- essential services so as to win IMF support, seen as crucial to kick-start the reform effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent talks in Harare between the organisation and the government failed to yield positive results, beyond expressions of intent from the lending institution and promises of further negotiations early in January to assess progress made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's dilemma is how to balance the books in the face of unplanned expenditure of more than 190 million dollars on salaries and bonuses for civil servants. This is at a time when other essential services such as health and education are competing for the government's scarce cash resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Projections are that the deficit in the year to June 1997 will exceed the original forecast of 8.5 percent, a figure unlikely to please experts at the IMF headquarters in Washington.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The Organization of African Unity (OAU) has called for a multisectorial approach that would simultaneously meet the continent's quest for universal vaccination and deal with the ravages caused by poverty, famine and malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Dakar Tuesday, the organization's Assistant Secretary General, Pascal Gayama, also called for the uplifting of the the situation of women &quot; since this directly affects the situation of the child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was presenting a paper titled &quot;The commitment from national leaders for vaccination and immunization&quot; at the 6th Consultative Group meeting of the Children's Vaccine Initiative, CVI, which entered its second and last day in the Senegalese capital on Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are many obstacles on the route that could lead to the the objective of keeping poliomyelitis out of Africa in the year 2000,&quot; Gayama said. &quot;For polio as for most of other diseases, including the AIDS pandemic, nothing is worth than a multisectorial approach capable of containing, at the same time as we search for universal immunization, the ravages caused by poverty, famine and malnutrition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU official noted the high cost of treating epidemics but appealed to rich countries not to deprive Africa of the beneficial progress being made by developed countries in the field of medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gayama also encouraged researchers to explore the potential of traditional herbs and medicine, which could assist in improving the well-being of Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He equally mentioned the Bamako Initiative, whose objective is to bring affordable medicine close to the people and communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He enumerated a series of activities which have been undertaken by African countries under the auspices of the OAU and with assistance from the World Health Organization to strengthen their vaccination activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among these actions, Gayama said, was the recent launching of a major African anti-polio vaccination campaign in South Africa, under the chairmanship of President Nelson Mandela. The campaign was co-launched with Rotary Club International and the WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He regretted, however, that the mushrooming of conflicts had aggravated the situation of African children, some of whom became refugees or displaced persons or faced with &quot;the omnipresent danger of epidemics, including that of HIV/AIDS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet, he said, slightly more than 28 African countries had doubled their rate of vaccinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gayama expressed the OAU's readiness to cooperate with the CVI partners -- UNICEF, UNDP, World Bank, WHO and the Rockfeller Foundation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polio, according to Dr Ebrahim Samba, the World Health Organization regional Director for Africa, still cripples at least 12,000 children on the continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 100 million doses will be donated in the next three years by Chiron Vaccines, Pasteur Merieux-Connaught and SmithKline Beechamm. The doses are expected to meet the vaccination needs of between 25-30 million African children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, a grant of one million U.S. dollars will be provided by Wyeth- Lederic Vaccines and Pediatrics for strengthening of a laboratory network for the crippling disease's surveillance in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation was accepted by the WHO Director General, Dr Hiroshi Nakajima and Dr Denis Broun, Chief of health section at UNICEF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was part of the highlights during the first day of the 6th Consultative group meeting of the Children's Vaccine Initiative (CVI), which ends here Tuesday evening.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - The Mozambican government on Thursday completed the privatisation of Vidreira, the only facotry in the country producing bottles and glassware.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 55 percent of the company is now owned by the Portuguese firm Barbosa e Almeida, while the remaining 45 percent remains in the hands of the state.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One peculiarity of this privatisation is that Vidreira has been split into two companies, Vidreira de Mocambique, and Cristalaria (crystalware) de Mocambique. The former is by far the larger company with initial capital of 5.  5 million U.S. dollars (three million from Barbosa e Almeida and 2.5 million from the Mozambican state).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial capital of the second company is 867,000 dollars, 400,000 held by the government and 467,000 by Barbosa e Almeida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the head of the Vidreira Privatisation Commission, Mariamo Carimo, the debts amassed by Vidreira under state ownership will be paid off by the sale of the factory installations valued at 2.5 million dollars to the new companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within three months, the two companies are to pay the state three million dollars, and this money will be used in the first instance to pay off Vidreira's debts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said tantalum explorations in nine areas of the Ado Shakiso district and trial production had yielded 20 to 30 tonnes of the mineral annualy during the last seven years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - President Jerry John Rawlings Tuesday held an olive branch at his political opponents and said should his National Democratic Congress (NDC) win, the party's supporters would celebrate with the losers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are members of one family.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will not be vindictive,&quot; he said. &quot;There is much work ahead and we need to work together to build the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was meeting officials from the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, one of several institutions which monitored Saturday's elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Supporters of all the political parties which took part in the elections conducted themselves in a peaceful manner,&quot; said Rawlings. &quot;I have always said a transformation has taken place in Ghana and I have been vindicated.  Ghanaians are peace-loving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With results from 138 constituencies, out of the 200, made public, Rawlings has 2,998,578 votes, representing 55.55 percent of the votes. John Agyekum Kufuor of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) has 2,231,524 votes (41.34 percent) while the third candidate, Dr Edward Mahama of the Peoples National Convention (PNC), has 167,153 votes (3.09 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the parliamentary race, NDC has 85 seats, NPP 50 and PNC has three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Kufuor Tuesday called on his supporters to remain calm and not to despair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let us all show patience and tolerance while we wait (for the final result) ,&quot; he told a press conference at his party's head office of the in Accra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The calm and dignity they showed on Saturday, given the tremendous turn- out, does us all credit.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cleveland, United States (PANA) - As the captain of the Nigerian under-23 soccer team at the Atlanta Games, Nwankwo Kanu's two spectacular goals in the competition's semi-finals helped Nigeria clinch the soccer gold, the country's first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, as a recovering heart patient at the 75-year-old Cleveland Clinic in the American state of Ohio, Kanu has turned to those same goals to uplift his spirit and help in his recovery process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With less than a minute to go in that semi-final match between Nigeria and Brazil, Kanu collected the ball in the opponents' 18-yard box and flipped it past hapless defenders even as he had to turn almost 180 degrees for tactical reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal drew Nigeria level at 3-3. Then, Kanu went ahead to score the &quot; golden goal&quot; that gave Nigeria the match.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting in a room in the 11,000-worker hospital complex a thin smile creased his face as he watched a video tape of that match. That changed to a broad smile as the images of him celebrating his first goal flashed across the screen of a 19-inch television set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thank God for seeing me through the surgery, and I hope to go back to the sport soon,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu has been discharged from the hospital where he underwent four hours of surgery to repair a heart valve which doctors say was defective from birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defect, diagnosed by Kanu's Italian club doctors at Inter Milan as a valvular insufficiency of the aorta, threatened his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However the doctors who performed the surgery have pronounced it a success.  The prognosis is good for a speedy return to the pitch for the 20-year-old star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My doctors have said that I will recover fully and could return to the sport...by February if I follow my rehab well,&quot; he told a visiting Nigerian delegation recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, he needs to settle his 100,000-dollar hospital bill and begin his graduated rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian government has already approved about 50,000 dollars for the bills and is expected to consider the player's appeal for further assistance since his rehabilitation bills will also run into several thousands of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu, tall with long, almost oversized limbs, has already started the first stage of rehabilitation. This includes daily workouts on a treadmill at the hospital's Rehabilitation Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyday he trades his navy blue bathrobe for a track-suit and a blue cap inscribed with the letter &quot;K&quot;, as the takes the elevator from his 14th-floor room to the rehabilitation center on the first floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet for the full rehabilitation, which will involve swimming and jogging, he has been scheduled to travel to a sports-oriented facility in California, thousands of miles away from Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cleveland facility is a non-profit academic medical center which has treated 75,000 patients from at least 100 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors at the clinic and his managers are not saying much in terms of when Kanu will return to sport, seemingly concentrating on restoring his health first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are taking it step by step,&quot; his manager, Franklin Sedoc, said. &quot;That's how we handled it when Kanu first learned about his heart condition and that's how we will approach his rehabilitation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cleveland Clinic cardiologist John Kramer said that Kanu's surgeon, Dr.  Bruce Lytle, decided to repair the defective valve rather than replace it.  This is designed to improve Kanu's chances of returning to soccer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, sources close to the hospital are more emphatic, saying that while the doctors are being cautious, they believe that the Nigerian international will go back to the sport in which he has recorded an impressive achievement even at 20 years of age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently named African Footballer of the Year for 1996, Kanu's past soccer glories include helping Nigeria's under-17 team to victory in Japan in 1993 and Dutch club Ajax Amsterdam to several titles, including the European Champions Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether he will come back to win more laurels remains to be seen but Kanu is not giving up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not finished,&quot; he said when the news of his heart problems broke. &quot;No one knows what the future holds but you have to fight for what you believe in.  I just want to get back to the pitch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Within a decade, Gambia has managed to vaccinate all its children against hepatitis B, a doctor from that nation has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the just-ended sixth working group meeting of the Children's Vaccine Initiative (CVI), Gambia was mentioned, together with Botswana, South Africa and Swaziland, as countries which had succeeded in &quot;sustaining hep B immunization within the EPI&quot;, or the Expanded Programme on Immunization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hepatitis B vaccine was originally developed to respond to the very high incidence of primary liver cancer in developing countries, as a result of chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Abdoulie Jack of Gambia's Medical Research Council Laboratories, Banjul, said the smallness of the country's population was a factor in its 100- percent vaccination coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, if we managed to do it, other countries can do it as well provided there is stringent management of the resources available, including cold chain systems, doses, vehicles and logistics,&quot; he told PANA in Dakar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that all African countries had the potential as Gambia to attain the same degree of cover against hepatitis B so long as the task was made part of their primary health care systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gambian surgeon Ebrihim Samba said poor management of resources for the vaccination programmes, in African countries, was regrettable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some countries, it is not surprising to find EPI vehicles being used to ferry fish,&quot; said Samba, the World Health Organization Regional Director for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that massive international funding for vaccination programmes in Africa had not been matched by results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of money and the reluctance of funding agencies to pump more of it into hepatitis B programmes were cited as reasons for the low levels of vaccination in some countries, although 74 nations have included hepatitis B vaccine within their EPI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Peter Ndumbe, of the Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Studies at Yaounde University, Cameroon, said funding agencies opted to give priority to poor countries which showed sustainable immunization programmes against other diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that besides inadequate money for hepatitis B, there had been problems in mobilizing resources for eradicating yellow fever, whose resurgence has been observed over the last five years in sub-Sahara Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a paper on the &quot;New Approaches To Vaccine Introduction,&quot; he said that 31 West, Central and Eastern African states were &quot;at risk of the urban and jungle cycles of epidemic and endemic yellow fever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yellow fever outbreaks, he said, were reported in Sierra Leone and Benin in 1996. In Benin, he added, 60 percent of the children who died &quot;had been fully immunized with the six routine EPI vaccines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To deal with the problem of inadequate funding for EPI, another document presented at the Dakar meeting urged governments to establish separate budgets for vaccination programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It called, also, on donors to direct their resources toward the vaccine independence initiative, so as to reduce dependency on external funds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Sudan's Ministry of the Interior confirmed Wednesday that former Prime Minister Sadiq Al Mahdi had left the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State radio and the government-run Sudan News Agency quoted the ministry as saying that &quot;Mr Sadiq Al Mahdi has disappeared from his home since Monday and later on it became clear that he is now outside the country.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry was reacting to a news reports Wednesday that Mahdi was now in Asmara, Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that Mahdi, who has opposed President Omar El Bashir's plan to impose Islam's Sharia laws on the nation, had not been forced to leave the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is common knowledge that Mr.Sadiq El Mahdi has been enjoying the freedom of movement and used to attend all occasions without any restrictions, &quot; said the ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahdi, an Oxford educated politician who was prime minister from 1986-1989, remained in Sudan despite his ouster in a bloodless coup in 1989 by Gen. Omar El Bashir. Mahdi refused to join the Sudanese opposition exile communities in Cairo, London or Asmara. He has said, often, he preferred a &quot;civil struggle&quot; to an armed confrontation in removing Bashir's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, opposition parties in exile including Mahdi's UMMA (freedom) Party joined recently with the anti-government Sudan People's Liberation Army of John Garang. They formed an allied army to fight the Bashir government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent government reports from Khartoum said the opposition forces, based in neighbouring Eritrea, had on many occasions attacked border army posts and planted mines which have killed or wounded many people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadiq El Mahdi is the great great grandson of Muhammad ibn el- Sayyid Abdullah who in 1883 defeated major Egyptian and British forces who tried to impose Egyptian rule over Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - The restoration of the Mobutu regime, with the installation of the Kengo government in July 1994, came in the wake of the genocide in Rwanda and at the time of France's intervention there to erase the traces of its own role as an accessory to crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having supported the Habyarimana regime and trained its genocidal machine, including the extremist Hutu Interahamwe militia, the French were relieved to have in Kinshasa a regime that would let them permit the Rwandan killers, both soldiers and militiamen, to cross into Zaire with all their weapons. The fact that these killers were now free to use Zairean territory to launch raids into Rwanda, and to slaughter Tutsi citizens and residents of Zaire, is the immediate cause of the current fighting in eastern Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The roots of this violent conflict lie deep in the history of the Great Lakes region as well as in the political alignments of the Mobutu regime nationally, regionally and internationally. There is, in the first place, the question of whether or not people of Rwandan origin, or Banyarwanda (Hutu, Tutsi and Twa), can claim Zairean citizenship on basis of being native to Zaire as of August 1885, when this country came into existence as the Congo Free State. If so, they would, as other indigenous people all over Africa, lay claim to ancestral lands in eastern Zaire. In the second place, the conflict has to do with the consequences for Zaire of the Hutu-Tutsi conflict in both Rwanda and Burundi. In either case, the actions and decisions of the Mobutu regime since 1972 have helped to exacerbate tensions and to bring about the present crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda and Burundi are two of the major precolonial kingdoms to have survived Western conquest and occupation as more or less viable political entities, with the monarchies being destroyed between 1959 and 1961 in Rwanda and between 1965 and 1968 in Burundi. The population of both countries is made up of three social groups traditionally distinguished on the basis of occupation: the Hutu (roughly 85%), the Tutsi (14%) and the Twa (1%). The Twa are a pygmoid people, who also have important settlements west of the great lakes in the equatorial forest of Central Africa, including the nearby Zaire's Ituri Forest. Contrary to colonially created myths, the Tutsi-Hutu conflict is not a centuries old struggle between &quot;Hamitic&quot; pastoralists (Tutsi) and Bantu agriculturists (Hutu). For the Tutsi are not &quot;Hamites.&quot; They are a Bantu people who share a common Bantu culture with the Hutu, with whom they speak a common Bantu language, Rinyarwanda or Rirundi, depending on the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration and settlement in eastern Zaire by the Banyarwanda occurred at different moments, and for a variety of reasons. As in other parts of the world, the entire Great Lakes region did constitute a commercial frontier for relatively powerful states like ancient Rwanda. And there is historical evidence that Rwandan agricultural colonies were established in the islands of Lake Kivu, now part of Zaire, in the 18th century. In addition to this, a group of ethnic Tutsi claims to have settled during the 17th century in the hills they have named &quot;Mulenge&quot; between Lakes Kivu and Tanganyika, or between Bukavu and Uvira in the South Kivu province of Zaire. Accordingly, they call themselves Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This oral tradition is hotly contested by other indigenous Zairean groups.  One of these, the Bafulero, actually contests the right of these ethnic Tutsi to call themselves &quot;Banyamulenge&quot; on the ground that &quot;Mulenge&quot; is the title of a Bafulero chief whose land is located some 200 kilometres south of the area occupied by these Tutsi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However true this dismissal of the Banyamulenge's oral history might be, it would be difficult to deny that some Rwandan settlements may have found themselves west of the colonial boundary as drawn in 1885. Moreover, the Banyarwanda who lived on Idjwi Island, the largest of Lake Kivu islands, became Belgian subjects in 1910, as did other Kinyarwanda speaking colonies in North Kivu, when Germany ceded the lands they occupied to Belgium, in a boundary adjustment between the two imperial powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal distinction between them and other Congolese became academic after Belgium took over Rwanda and Burundi in 1920 as League of Nations mandatory power and, in 1945, as United Nations trusteeship authority. For all practical purposes, Belgium governed Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi as a single colonial entity known as &quot;Le Congo Belge et le Ruanda-Urundi&quot;, with a single army, the Force Publique, a single governor general in Kinshasa and two lieutenant governors general in Lubumbashi and Bujumbura, respectively.  As a teenager growing up in the Belgian Congo in the 1950s, it never occurred to me that these three territories were destined to become three separate nation-states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgium moved thousands of Banyarwanda peasants to the eastern Zaire districts of Masisi, Rutshuru and Walikale m North Kivu between 1937 and 1955, for purposes of easing the demographic pressure in heavily populated Rwanda, and recruited thousands more for work in mining, transport and agricultural enterprises in Shaba, Maniema and South Kivu provinces throughout the colonial period. Most of these Banyarwanda voted in the first municipal elections of 1957-58, and in the general or independence elections of 1960.  Representatives of their communities, albeit few ones, were also elected to public office in Zaire. In spite of a new influx of Banyarwanda in 1959-61, mostly Tutsi political refugees fleeing their homeland as a result of the Rwandan Revolution, Zaire continued to welcome them with open arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Problems began to appear when the numbers of Banyarwanda grew progressively due to both natural increase and clandestine immigration in the postcolonial period. In January 1972, under the influence of his Tutsi chief of staff Bisengimana Rwema, Mobutu signed a decree giving Zairean citizenship to all natives of Rwanda and Burundi who had settled in Zaire before 1950. In addition to their success in professional and business activities, the Banyarwanda in general and the Tutsi in particular were now in a stronger political position to use their proximity to Mobutu for greater economic and social gains. This they did with gusto, using their financial means and their newly found political power to acquire more land in heavily populated North and South Kivu provinces. Needless to say, they could always find indigenous chiefs who were willing and even eager to privatize ancestral lands in exchange for money and/or political favours. All this increased the resentment that other Zaireans had towards them, which was partly based on the latter's distaste for the Banyarwanda's apparent social exclusiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1972 decree was so unpopular that Mobutu himself accepted to sign a law passed by his one-party parliament in June 1981 invalidating the decree and defining Zairean nationality or citizenship on basis of membership in an ethnic group known to exist within the borders of Zaire as defined in August 1885. By this token, only those Banyarwanda who had actually solicited and obtained naturalization in Zaire could be declared citizens. All those who were citizens by virtue of being descendants of pre-1885 settlements, of the 1910 boundary change, and of the pre-1950 migratory movements were automatically deprived of their Zairean citizenship. The question that this action raises with respect to international law and fundamental human rights, and the one that the Banyarwanda raised at the national conference in 1992, is whether it is legally and morally acceptable for a state to deprive a section or stratum of its inhabitants of their citizenship rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stripped of their citizenship, Banyarwanda peasants are also denied land rights, as the land they occupy and use is being claimed as ancestral land by the indigenous groups among whom they live. The land question is at the heart of the conflict between them and other Zaireans in both North and South Kivu.  Before the genocide in Rwanda, thousands of people died in interethnic violence in 1992-93 in North Kivu. Instead of finding ways of resolving the conflict in a responsible manner, Zairean authorities added fuel to fire with xenophobia appeals, while soldiers and military officers became implicated in arms trafficking on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An example of this state-sponsored terrorism is the xenophobia campaign waged by the provincial authorities of North and South Kivu before and during the current war in eastern Zaire. In September 1996, South Kivu Deputy Governor Lwasi Ngabo Lwabanji stated in a radio broadcast that if the Tutsi Banyamulenge did not leave Zaire within a week, they would be interned in camps and exterminated. The Banyamulenge's reply was succinctly put by a young fighter who told Chris McGreal of the Mail and Guardian that &quot;we don't come from Rwanda and they cannot force us to go because we know how to fight and the army does not&quot; (M&amp;G, 25-31 Oct. 1996). Being basically a praetorian guard, Mobutu's army was decisively routed in a very short time, as the Tutsi and their allies took control of Uvira, Bukavu and Goma, the major cities of the Kivu region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the present time, the plight of the Banyarwanda is inextricably linked to the Hutu-Tutsi conflict in Rwanda and Burundi. The 1990 invasion of Rwanda by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) from Uganda; the assassination of the first democratically elected President of Burundi, the Front Democratique Burundais (FRODEBU) leader Melchior Ndadaye; and the genocide in Rwanda are part of the political background to the current conflict in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Tutsi communities all over the world and in the Great Lakes region in particular, the Tutsi of Zaire did raise funds for the RPF cause and send some of their young people to take part in the struggle as fighters. This participation in the RPF war effort, at a time when the Zairean government was supporting the Habyarimana regime, did raise questions as to the loyalty of Zaire's Tutsi in particular and that of the Banyarwanda in general. To many patriots in Zaire, this type of behaviour meant that the Banyarwanda were using their Zairean citizenship in an expedient manner-for purely political ends or pecuniary advantage-while their real heart and loyalty were elsewhere. However understandable such feelings are, they do not justify officially led or sanctioned xenophobia campaigns against all Tutsi.  Statements broadcast by South Kivu Governor Kyembwa wa Lumuna and his deputy Lwasi were, according to McGreal, &quot;remarkably similar to the extremist Hutu messages broadcast during the Rwandan genocide&quot; (Mail and Guardian, Nov. 1-7, 1996).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mobutu regime bears a major blame for the current situation, for having allowed the French through their Operation Turquoise, to assist Habyarimana's army and the Interahamwe to regroup in Zaire for purposes of reconquering Rwanda. These killers then used the Zairean refugee camps to raid Rwanda on a regular basis and to organize the slaughter of Zaire's Tutsi. For two years and a half, Zaire and the international community watched and did nothing to stop this, while the UN and the major powers continued to be more preoccupied with feeding refugees, including the killers, rather than searching for a solution to the whole crisis. Like any other responsible government would, Rwandan authorities have given military support to the Tutsi of Zaire as a way of putting an end to the Hutu extremists' raids into Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the rebel alliance is doing the job that the international community failed to do, the only justification for humanitarian intervention in the Great Lakes region is to pursue and arrest all the remaining killers to bring them to justice for genocide, and to prepare an enabling environment for the resettlement of the returnees in Rwanda. There is no need for foreign military intervention in Zaire. The UN-mandated intervention does not inspire confidence, because it was initiated by the French, whose motives are suspect.  Jean-Francois Medard, a world renowned professor of African affairs at the Institute of Political Studies at the University of Bordeaux in France told Newsweek magazine in 1994 that &quot;French policy in Africa is erratic and criminal,&quot; as his country's &quot;government operates not on principle, but on cynicism&quot; (Newsweek, November 21, 1994, p. 30).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, a word about the so-called rebel alliance. The Tutsi are not fighting alone. They have been joined by several non-Tutsi groups of rebels who have waged for years a low intensity and at times sporadic campaign of armed struggle against the Mobutu regime. The best known of these groups is the Parti de la Revolution Populaire (PRP), a remnant of the 1964 eastern front of the &quot;second independence&quot; movement, which is led by Laurent Kabila.  For over 30 years, the PRP has maintained a maquis in the mountains of the Fizi-Baraka area near Uvira, and has not succeeded in playing its once expected role as a spearhead of the second phase of the national liberation struggle in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alliance's administrative control over Goma, Bukavu and Uvira is the latest but much larger version of the state-within-a-state that the PRP has maintained for years over its Fizi-Baraka enclave. Mr. Kabila, the PRP chief, had for all practical purposes become a typical African warlord rather than a revolutionary guerrilla leader. If he and his allies are to be congratulated for once again showing to the whole world the bankruptcy of the Mobutu regime and, above all, for ending the Rwandan refugee problem in Zaire, they are far from being the liberators they hope to be. For a strategy of genuine national liberation requires the kind of political work that the PRP has not done, nor has the capacity to undertake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a legitimate and democratically elected government can resolve the land and citizenship issues involving the Banyarwanda of Zaire. The PRP-led alliance is part of the popular struggle for democracy in Zaire, and needs to be brought into the ongoing process of peaceful change initiated by the democracy movement since 1980. As for the Great Lakes region as a whole, there will be no durable peace and security without democracy and social progress in Zaire, on the one hand, and until a just and lasting solution is found to the problem of coexistence between Hutu and Tutsi in Rwanda and Burundi, on the other.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome - EASTERN ZAIRE: A UN team, consisting of WFP, UNHCR and UNICEF representatives, visited the Uvira area over the weekend and returned to Bukavu 9 December. Access to the port was denied as was access to Fizi for security reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TANZANIA: Up to 25,000 refugees, mainly from Kagenyi and Rubwera camps in the Karagwe area, are reported to have dispersed. While most have moved south towards Chabalisa, some 5,500 moved northwards towards the Ugandan border.  Unconfirmed reports of insecurity in area south of Murungo. It has been reported that refugees are preparing to return to Rwanda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP has offered its empty food bags to assist in the packing and transport of personal effects. There should be enough bags to provide one bag to every two refugees. Weekly food distributions commenced yesterday in Tanzania camps and should be completed by tomorrow morning. This should ensure a food supply to those returnees heading to Rwanda during repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RWANDA: On 9 December, WFP and NGO partners (CARE, CRS, LWF, World Vision, Concern, CRR, IFRC, Trocaire, Caritas, ADRA, MEC, GAA, AHA, World Relief, AEF, EEF, IRC, MSF, ASS, Salvation Army, Ingabo) distributed approximately 746 metric tons of food. This represents 44,670 people assisted with a monthly ration. All returnees (from the large inflow during November) have received their initial 7-day ration at the commune level with most now receiving monthly rations. The ration is made up of 400 g of cereals, 120 g of pulses, 20 g of oil and 5 g of salt per person and per day. WFP, UN agencies and NGOs have put together a detailed contingency plan in Kibungo prefecture for the return of refugees from Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven way stations will be set up along the road from the border to Curazo (36.5 km from Rusumo). These way stations will provide water, medical care and biscuits. The average distance between way stations will be 11 km. WFP continues to supply food to prefectures, focusing on areas expecting returnees from Tanzania. 1,200 metric tons of mixed commodities were transported within the country over the weekend of 7-8 December. In Kibungo, WFP and partner agencies have thus far prepositioned 463 mt of food in nine of the Kibungo communes, representing 122,600 weekly rations already in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prepositioning of food in Kibungo prefecture continues in preparation for a possible 340,000 returnees to this prefecture. WFP and NGO partners hold regular weekly meetings to discuss issues and problems faced during food distributions and preparations for the possible influx of refugees from Tanzania. All NGOs have agreed to involve women's groups in their ongoing distributions and longer term objectives such as an expansion of WFP's food- for-work activities in the communes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP and partners are keen to ensure that women make an active contribution to the planning and monitoring of new projects, as well as benefit directly from any new initiatives. One of the most serious problems being encountered at commune level is the lack of storage space. The use of &quot;Cocoons&quot; (small storage facilities of 20 to 100 mt capacity provided by CARE) and the increased number of WFP storage tents of 500 ton capacity in the country (two erected with six more under way) should help alleviate this problem.  Following reports of irregular rainfalls in Butare and Gikongoro prefectures, the FAO/WFP crop assessment mission in the country will visit these areas to assess the situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Rwandan refugees in Tanzania appear to be on the verge of leaving the camps in large numbers. A report from the office of the Humanitarian Coordinator in Kigali said 13,000 Muslims throughout the camps had asked to be repatriated this weekend. They will probably walk to the Rusumo border crossing, with some transport assistance for vulnerable groups. UNHCR, in its daily report, said the atmosphere in the Ngara camps was relaxed and refugees seemed to be preparing to go back. Some were selling their belongings or harvesting their beans. Further north, in Karagwe, the situation was less clear with reports of some 23,000 refugees fleeing away from the border following a campaign of intimidation by Hutu extremists in the camps.  According to WFP, many of these refugees had moved south towards Chabalisa, but around 5,000 were heading northwards to the Ugandan border. UNHCR said the local authorities in the Karagwe region were enforcing measures promulgated a year ago, to restrict the movement of refugees outside four kms of the camps and to stop all commercial activities. UNHCR added it was sending 270 trucks to Tanzania from Rwanda to be used in the repatriation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio Tanzania today said arrangements to repatriate 130,000 refugees in Karagwe had been finalised. It quoted the district commissioner as saying the plans had been drawn up with UNHCR collaboration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 559 refugees from Karagwe arrived at a refugee camp in southwest Uganda yesterday and Monday, and it was expected that more would arrive today, WFP said. Oruchinga camp in Mbarara shelters 6,500 refugees, 5,000 of whom are Rwandan Hutu moderates who left the country in 1992-94. The refugees coming from Tanzania are crossing the Kagera river which straddles the border by private canoe, and then walking the remaining 2kms to the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A WFP programme for supplying food to Rwandan prefectures expecting an influx of returnees from Tanzania is underway. WFP said 1,200 MT of mixed commodities were transported within Rwanda over the weekend. A detailed contingency plan has been elaborated by WFP, UN agencies and NGOs for Kibungo prefecture, which may have to cope with as many as 340,000 returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of the Tanzanian and Rwandan governments and UNHCR are due to hold a meeting at the Tanzania-Rwanda border crossing tomorrow. The meeting is likely to be continued in the Ngara camps the next day and is expected to kick-start the repatriation process which is planned to begin at Ngara. All returnees will be required to register at commune level, DHA Kigali said. During the repatriation from eastern Zaire, there was some confusion as some refugees registered at commune level and others at sectoral level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers, quoted by Reuters, said they believed Tanzanian troop reinforcements were heading for the northwestern camps to enforce the government's repatriation deadline of December 31 and that anyone escaping from the camps would face arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye yesterday warned refugees against taking part in politics or military training and told them to respect the laws of the land. Addressing Burundian refugees at a camp in Kibondo district, he said they should continue living peacefully until they were ready to go home, Tanzanian radio reported. Any refugees who left the camps would be arrested, jailed and repatriated despite the fact that their countries were in turmoil. The minister said the warning came after the arrest of some refugees who had been involved in murder, theft and poaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exiled Rwandan Hutu organisation, Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda (RDR), has alleged, in a statement issued on Monday, that the repatriation of Rwandan refugees from Tanzania may just be the start of a new cycle of instability and a &quot;return to square one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN inter-agency mission which flew over the Shabunda area on Sunday and Monday confirmed the presence of some 50,000 mostly Rwandan refugees in the region of Katshunga. The team - made up of UNHCR, DHA, UNDP, UNICEF, WHO plus MSF and advisers of the Zairean interior and defence ministries - found that the Zairean army had cut off the road beteen Shabunda and Kindu at Matukamo/Magenbe and were preventing refugees from walking towards Kindu. The plane managed to land at Shabunda and after some time on foot, the team located two refugee camps near Nialubwe, one consisting of 300-400 people, the other of about 2,000. These camps cannot be seen from the air. The mission also established that many refugees, some 20,000, were walking towards Walikale and then onwards to Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR said 1,400 refugees from the Virunga National Park in the Goma region returned to Rwanda via Cyangugu yesterday. It said about 35,000 refugees, who had emerged from the forests, had been repatriated since November 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kisangani has been calm over the past few days and newly-arrived Special Presidential Division troops are reported to be in control of the situation, according to the UN in Kinshasa. Only sporadic gunfire has been heard. Local authorities and missionary sources indicate a general price increase and overall food shortages, especially in Kisangani, Lubutu and Kindu. The local authorities warn that if the food situation does not improve by next week, the overall health of the population and general security are quickly expected to deteriorate. The Belgian embassy in Kinshasa announced that it had provided about 110 MT of food aid to affected people and soldiers in Kisangani over a week ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unconfirmed reports said pockets of ex-FAR and Interahamwe troops have engaged Zairean rebels in a series of clashes, west of Goma. According to an AFP report, local eyewitnesses claimed the fighting, some 50kms away from Goma, had been underway for several days. Zairean Justice Minister Joseph Nsinga Udjuu meanwhile has urged the international community not to abandon his country. He called on countries &quot;to resume their place at the side of the Zairean people and help it (Zaire) to again find political, social and economic stability without which human rights are at risk.&quot; The UN High Commission for Human Rights announced the deployment of the first two observers to Kinshasa yesterday, following allegations of human rights abuses in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USA and its European allies yesterday stressed the need to deploy a multi-national force (MNF) to the Great Lakes region to help with the humanitarian crisis, according to a spokesman for Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke. He was speaking after a meeting in Brussels on the sidelines of a NATO ministerial gathering which included US, French, British and Dutch delegates. &quot;No-one at the meeting questioned it (MNF),&quot; the spokesman said.  He added that an ambassadorial level meeting on Friday at UN headquarters in New York should confirm yesterday's talks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . GREAT LAKES - Complex Emergency Situation Report No. 11 Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, December 10, 1996. Note: The last situation report was dated December 5, 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda people, who are Tutsi of Rwandan origin, settled in the Mulenge hills of South Kivu, Zaire, and the Masisi region of North Kivu, Zaire, more than 200 years ago. Sporadic ethnic violence in the Masisi region has occurred since 1959, but it again escalated in the fall of 1995 as the former Rwandan army (the ex-FAR) and the Rwandan Hutu militia (the Interahamwe) targeted Banyarwanda Tutsi in an apparent attempt to create an area of Hutu control. In September 1996, the situation in the Uvira region of South Kivu began to resemble that of the Masisi region, as government-sanctioned harassment of Banyamulenge Tutsis intensified. On October 8, 1996, the South Kivu Deputy Governor declared that Banyamulenge residents should leave the area within seven days or risk treatment as rebels.  On October 14, fighting broke out between the Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairian Army (FAZ) near Runingo refugee camp, in South Kivu, forcing the roughly 220,000 refugees to flee. The Banyamulenge joined forces with other Zairian rebels to form the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), and the fighting spread, moving up the eastern border of Zaire from Uvira to Bukavu, as well as south from Rutshuru (North Kivu) to Goma. As a result of shelling from Rwanda on October 26 and November 1, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kibumba, Katale, and Kahindo camps near Goma, fled to Mugunga camp. Both the ex-FAR and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)-financed Zairian Camp Security Contingent (CZSC), became involved in the fighting. After suffering defeat, the FAZ and CZSC retreated to the west, looting villages and displacing Zairians from Goma town and surrounding areas. Following Hutu attacks from Mugunga camp on Goma town, the ADFL counter-attacked on November 14, forcing the ex-FAR and Interahamwe to retreat to the west and compelling hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan refugees: An estimated 600,000 Rwandan refugees have returned from the Goma area camps to Rwanda. Zambia hosts 1,000 Rwandan refugees, and Tanzania hosts 1,200.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian refugees: Of the 143,000 Burundian refugees originally in the Uvira area, some 62,000 refugees have returned to Burundi and about 13,500 have arrived in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newly Displaced: Fleeing continued fighting in Burundi, a new caseload of about 100,000 Burundian refugees has entered Tanzania. Approximately 35,000 Zairians have fled to Tanzania. About 475 Rwandan and Zairian Tutsis were airlifted from Brazzaville, Congo, to Kigali, Rwanda. Some 800 remain in the Congo and 11,500 Zairians are reported in Uganda. The U.S. Embassy in Zaire estimates that 170,000 Zairians have been displaced by the conflict in eastern Zaire, including 20,000 from Uvira, 60,000 from Bukavu, 40,000 from Goma, and 50,000 from rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unknown Populations: The U.S. military estimates there are 225,000 to 285, 000 people on the move within Zaire. UNHCR believes that there still may be as many as 400,000. It is uncertain whether these are displaced Zairians, Rwandan or Burundian refugees or former Rwandan militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Situation The United Nations (U.N.) World Food Program (WFP) reports that some 28,000 returnees came back to Rwanda from Zaire during the week of November 27 to December 2, 24,000 via Gisenyi, 3,500 via Cyangugu, and 500 via Kibungo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 5, the Government of Tanzania (GOT) announced a decision to close the Rwandan refugee camps by December 31. Relief agencies are preparing for the return of an estimated 410,000 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political/Military Situation Clashes continue in eastern Zaire, between ADFL and FAZ forces. The ADFL claims to have captured towns at the northern and southern ends of a 250 mile front. Reports that the ADFL captured Kindu and Kisangani do not appear accurate. The U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA) reports that the situation in Kisangani has become increasingly volatile. Some 400 Zairian soldiers remain in Kisangani after fleeing the rebel advance in north Kivu and shooting and looting are common occurrences. Uvira, Bukavu, and Goma remain calm and under ADFL control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1080, the U.S. Government (USG) plans to participate in a multinational effort, led by Canada, to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the repatriation of refugees. The mission of the multinational force is still under discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USG has helped to locate groups of refugees and displaced persons in eastern Zaire using aerial surveys and other means to gain accurate and complete information. The USG and others are working with the Canadians to plan for airdrops of emergency food to stranded refugees if necessary. Relief agencies have expressed reservations about airdrops, executed in the absence of a team on the ground to clear the drop zone and ensure distribution to malnourished refugees and/or internally displaced persons (IDPs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donors and humanitarian agencies are providing relief and rehabilitation assistance to returnees in accordance with the Government of Rwanda (GOR) plan, agreed upon at a conference hosted by the Canadian International Development Agency in Geneva on November 23. Participants agreed to support the GOR in promoting reconciliation and dialogue and in meeting reintegration and development needs, including housing, justice, security, and human resources development. Participants also called on all parties involved in the conflict to allow full humanitarian access to refugees and displaced persons in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 18, the U.N. announced a $259.5 million Flash Appeal for U.N.  programs in Rwanda and eastern Zaire. UNHCR issued an appeal on November 19 for $66.9 million to support its emergency operations for refugees and IDPs in eastern Zaire and the immediate integration of more than 500,000 returnees in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 15, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) launched an appeal for $38.5 million to support its eastern Zaire operation for three months. ICRC has Government of Zaire (GOZ) permission to operate throughout Zaire and has the capacity to provide non-food relief for 525,000 people and food for 250,000 people per month. The GOR has sanctioned U.N.  agencies and ten non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to provide cross- border assistance to refugees in eastern Zaire. Approved NGOs include Concern International, Medicins Sans Frontieres/Holland (MSF/Holland), American Refugee Committee (ARC), Trocaire, Oxfam, Save the Children Fund/UK (SCF/UK), African Humanitarian Action, Merlin, International Rescue Committee (IRC), and Lutheran World Federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uvira: On December 3, a U.N./NGO team gained access to Uvira for the first time since expatriate relief workers evacuated on October 22. The team saw no refugees on the road from Bukavu to Uvira. They found that the WFP and UNHCR offices and warehouses had been looted. Access to the port was denied but the two cranes were reportedly intact. Uvira town is calm and markets have re- opened and are well-stocked. The nearby refugee camps are deserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bukavu: Since mid-October, about 8,000 refugees have returned through the Bukavu-Cyangugu corridor. UNHCR is planning for the possible return of 30,000 Rwandan refugees from the Bukavu area and for some 25,000 Zairian IDPs who are making their way to Bukavu. In preparation, NGOs have established four way stations to provide water and medical assistance. NGOs currently working in Bukavu include Concern International, MSF/International, IRC, SCF/UK, Christian Aid, Oxfam, and Caritas. U.N agencies and ICRC are also working in Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goma: On November 27, a convoy of relief agencies found some 40,000 Rwandan refugees in fairly good health in Minova, located about 35 km southwest of Goma. On November 28, some of these refugees began moving towards Goma.  Relief agencies set up way stations between Minova and Goma to distribute high protein biscuits and to provide water, sanitation, and health care.  Relief agencies have been denied access to Minova since November 29 due to fighting in the area, but distribution of biscuits continues at way stations in Sake, Mugunga, and Kulungu. Fighting has reportedly pushed those remaining in the Minova area westward further into Zaire. The following relief organizations are currently operating in Goma: ARC, Merlin, Trocaire, SCF/UK, Concern International, Catholic Relief Services (CRS)/Caritas, Oxfam, MSF/I, ICRC, UNHCR, and WFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kisangani: Access to the internally displaced populations in this area is now hindered by insecurity. Aviation Sans Frontieres pulled out of the area after its aircraft came under fire on December 2 and ICRC has withdrawn staff from both Kisangani and Kindu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda: Of the 600,000 estimated returnees, nearly 323,000 have registered in their home communes as of December 1, according to the U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda UNHCR reports that the returnees are in good condition in general and in some of the communes are placed temporarily in a transit center until they are registered. After registration, they collect a seven-day food ration and will eventually receive monthly rations. UNICEF provides 100 grams of blended food supplement to all children under five years of age. Food distribution is ongoing in all prefectures of Rwanda.  Distributions are implemented at the commune level with the exception of Mutara, Kibungo, Butare, Gikongoro, and Cyangugu where returnees receive assistance in transit centers at the prefecture level. From November 16 to December 6, WFP and NGO partners distributed approximately 6,170 metric tons (MT), which represents a total of 1,600,000 weekly rations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP plans food-for-work activities for the seasonal lean periods of December and March-April, for returnees as well as the local population.  Emphasis will be placed on assisting women-headed families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOR Ministry of Rehabilitation and Social Integration reported on November 25 that there were 135,000 families without shelter in rural areas and 65,000 families in urban areas, of which about 20% are in Kigali. Some returnees find their homes occupied by squatters when they return. The GOR has given squatters two weeks to vacate dwellings belonging to returnees and has set up temporary transit centers to house returnees and displaced residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi: WFP food reserves in Burundi are being depleted rapidly. WFP is attempting to move food and fuel across Lake Tanganyika from Kigoma , Tanzania, to import the 2,500 MT of food per month approved by the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reports that of the 62,000 Burundian refugees who have returned to Burundi from Zaire, about 45,000 spontaneously repatriated to Cibitoke province and 15,000 arrived through the Gatumba transit center outside Bujumbura. WFP is distributing returnee packages to both populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Burundi (HRFOB), UNHCR, and NGOs are closely monitoring returns to areas where fighting is taking place. UNHCR reports that about 38,000 of the returnees to Cibitoke have settled in 10 government sites. HRFOB currently has five human rights observers and two officers providing technical assistance in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania: Tanzanian refugee camps are burgeoning, as a result of influxes from Burundi and from eastern Zaire. WFP reports that new arrivals from Burundi are in poor nutritional state, with a 19% malnutrition rate for children under five years of age recorded in Mtendeli camp. WFP is sending additional quantities of corn-soy blend to the Kigoma region for supplementary feeding programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joint statement issued by UNHCR and the GOT stated that conditions in Rwanda now allow for safe repatriation of Rwanda refugees. The GOR has given its commitment to receive all the Rwandan refugees and assumes responsibility for the repatriation. UNHCR has asked that all vulnerable persons wishing to return to Rwanda, including the elderly, the disabled, unaccompanied minors, and pregnant women, register with UNHCR by December 9 so that arrangement could be made for their transport. Some refugees have stated that they will require confirmation that their land is unoccupied prior to returning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 4, the humanitarian community met in Kibungo, Rwanda, to coordinate relief efforts for refugees returning from Tanzania. The GOR wants relief assistance along the Ngara-Kibungo corridor provided in a staggered manner so as to encourage refugees to keep moving rather than encamping at way stations. The GOR has suggested establishment of water points every 5 km, way stations every 10 km, health posts every 10-15 km, and biscuit distribution points every 20 km.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF/I and Swiss Disaster Relief will be responsible for epidemic control and ARC will operate two mobile health units from Rusumo, Rwanda, at the border, to Kibungo. IRC and Oxfam will be responsible for water and sanitation needs from Rusumo to Kayonza, 92 km inside the border. From Kayonza a separate route splits off toward Kagitumba, 100 km to the north.  ARC will handle all major relief efforts along this route. SCF, ICRC, and Food for the Hungry (FHI) will be working on unaccompanied children issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs divided responsibilities for coordination of all NGO relief activities along the corridor that returnees will take. From Rusumo to Rwanteru, 18 km from the border, MSF/I will coordinate activities. World Vision Relief and Development (WVRD) will coordinate activities from Kirehe, 25 km inside the border, to Remera, 68 km from the border. ARC will be responsible for the piece stretching from Kabarondo, 76 km inside the border, to Rwamagana, 107 km from the border. USAID's Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) will be providing funds to NGOs assisting returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP is pre-positioning food commodities in Kibungo, Byumba, and Butare prefectures. Food is being pre-positioned at the commune level with the assistance of NGOs. Repatriation packages consisting of food and non-food items will be distributed at the commune level. UNHCR reports that 274 Rwandan refugees returned from Tanzania on December 5.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - GOVERNMENT is to build a new hydro-power station on lower Kafue river at a cost of about US$350 million, Energy and Water Development Minister, Suresh Desai, disclosed in Lusaka Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the start of the traditional process of familiarisation with the operations of the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation, Mr Desai declared that there is an urgent of developing new electricity generating capacities as the country is likely to run out of power by the year 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Considering the long lead time required to develop a power station, we must accelerate the development of sites with high potential such as Kafue Gorge lower and Itezhi-tezhi,&quot; Mr Desai said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Minister observed that his Ministry is charged with the responsibility of advancing water access programmes, nevertheless it has three urgent areas which include the provision of electricity in rural areas for enhanced agriculture and industry support projects and the development of new stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition the Ministry is trying to mount electricity conservation programmes in view of a serious drop in the water levels of major hydro- electric dams like the Kariba and Itezhi-tezhi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Desai was also hopeful that the recently introduced rural electrification fund can be supported whole-heartedly by the entire nation so that more financial resources can be put into it to enable the ministry carry on with the big task of taking &quot;power to the people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from visiting ZESCO, Mr Desai will also have meetings with Chief Executives of companies that have dealings with his Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among these is Zambia National Oil Company, TAZAMA Pipelines Limited, Indeni Refinery, BP Zambia Limited, Lublend and Zambezi River Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I shall be undertaking field visits to see for myself the operations of these companies and the projects and programmes that are on-going,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - GOVERNMENT on Tuesday held consultations with the donor community over agricultural policies and other areas of common interest in the Zambian economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the meeting new Agricultural Food and Fisheries Minister, Edith Nawakwi, was catergorical that government and the donor community must share praises for the successes of the Agriculture Sector Investment Programme (ASIP) and blame for its failures as well and not to apportion success to the donor community and failure to the Zambian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Nawakwi said ASIP will only succeed if timely and adequate release of funds is adhered to by both partners but however, regreted the donors had adopted unexplained red-tape which has brought late release of money for agro- programmes and this had impacted negatively on the proper implementation of the scheme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agricultural Sector Investment Programme is an economic arrangement between the Zambian government and western donor nations under which farming is to be strengthened with funding from both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme was also to have embraced the restructuring programme for the Ministry of Agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her remarks Ms Nawakwi lamented that due to poor funding the peasant farming sector has performed dismally leading to farmers living in abject poverty to suffer even more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally the restructuring process at her ministry has equally stalled on account of lack of funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministry permanent secretary, Austin Sichinga, was hopeful that the restructuring process will be done by next month adding that the delay of the programme was due also to the under estimation of the whole process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on behalf of the donor community in Zambia, Food and Agriculture Organisation Resident Representative, George Mburathi, said that their side views the progress of ASIP as satisfactory but there are continuing challenges at macro-economic and sectoral levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mburathi said inflation and interest rates have remained high and this is a major impediment to investment in the sector as well as the management of agricultural credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European Union Agricultural Advisor, E Voss, said that the Zambian government needs to come up with a policy statement on such issues as the liberalisation of the fertiliser marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Voss said EU fertiliser which is currently being sold through the agricultural commodity exchange is not being bought because most farmers are waiting for the government fertiliser which he doubted if it would reach the target on time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Women in Agriculture Cordinator, Cecilia Makota, pointed out that inspite of the EU encouraging the private sector to partcipate in the fertiliser distribution it had not come out with a right price and the result was that farmers were shunning the EU fertiliser because it is considered to be very expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She pointed out that now most farmers were waiting for the chemical fertilisers which will be brought in by government agents as these are expected to be cheaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government is expected to import about 50,000 metric tonnes of fertiliser to be distributed through the agricultural credit management programme and already 6,500 tonnes of compound D have started arriving in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Sichinga says frantic efforts are being made to speed up the process of bringing in the input so that it does not arrive too late for the farmers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - The Security Council this evening extended the mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) until 28 February 1997 and approved the Secretary-General's recommendation to resume withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units during February 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to resolution 1087 (1996), adopted unanimously, the pace of UNAVEM's withdrawal would be commensurate with progress achieved in the quartering areas, in demobilization and in the extension of State administration throughout Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council also authorized the Secretary-General to begin gradual withdrawal of UNAVEM units from individual quartering areas prior to February 1997 and to accelerate the withdrawal schedule, if former combatants vacated the quartering areas in accordance with the 1994 Lusaka Protocol and if other factors were conducive to withdrawal, without putting the peace process at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council requested the Secretary-General to report, no later than 10 February, on a plan for a limited follow-on United Nations presence which would include military observers, police observers, a political component, human rights monitors and a Special Representative. It expressed readiness to consider, in that context, the possibility of sending a Council mission to Angola before the expiration of UNAVEM III's mandate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reminding the Government of Angola and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to uphold, without delay, their obligations under the Lusaka Protocol, the Council stressed that both parties must immediately begin to cooperate on integrating selected UNITA officers and troops into the Angolan Armed Forces and on demobilizing those remaining in the quartering areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before the Council met, it received a letter from the Government of Angola stating that President Jose Eduardo dos Santos had ordered the appointment of nine UNITA generals to functions in the Ministry of Defence and in the Angolan Armed Forces. The letter will be issued as document S/1996/102. Also, according to several speakers this evening, prior to the Council meeting UNITA had issued a declaration that all its soldiers had been quartered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council in its resolution called on UNITA to cooperate with the Government in creating an integrated Angolan Armed Forces and police units, which would begin the gradual, orderly and peaceful extension of State administration into areas formerly occupied by UNITA. It also urged the Government to avoid offensive military operations which went beyond those strictly necessary for the restoration and maintenance of law and order in the area formerly occupied by UNITA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also by the resolution adopted this evening, the Council urged the two parties to reach agreement on the special status of the President of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, as the President of the largest opposition party before 31 December 1996, without linking that issue to the formation of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation. Accordingly, it called on the President of UNITA to travel to Luanda for the creation of such a Government and, thereafter, to maximize the amount of time spent in Luanda to enhance confidence in the country's democratic institutions and the irreversibility of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statements were made by the representatives of Angola, Portugal, Botswana, France, China, United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, Egypt, Indonesia, Russian Federation, Chile, Republic of Korea, Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, United States, Italy, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Brazil, Zambia, Mauritius, Mozambique, United Republic of Tanzania, Lesotho, South Africa, Malawi and Sao Tome and Principe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting began at 5:27 and adjourned at 8 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Work Programme</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council met this afternoon to consider the situation in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a progress report on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) before the Council (document S/1996/1000), the Secretary-General recommends the extension of the Mission's mandate until 28 February 1997.  Should the Council approve the recommendation, the cost of maintaining UNAVEM III during the extension period will be at an estimated monthly rate of $25, 452,733 gross ($24,953,130 net), subject to the approval of a revised budget for the financing of the Mission by the Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says a continued but substantially scaled-down United Nations presence in Angola will be required after February 1997 to conclude the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol and to consolidate the gains made so far in the peace process. (The Lusaka Protocol was agreed upon by the Government of Angola and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in the Zambian capital in November 1994.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, submitted in response to Security Council resolution 1075 (1996) of 11 October, the activities of the Mission will be increasingly concentrated on political, police and human rights monitoring, as well as on vital humanitarian activities including demining, public information programmes and logistic support. The Secretary-General intends to elaborate on those tasks in his next report to the Council and to make recommendations on the mandate, structure and size of a follow-up United Nations presence after the withdrawal of the bulk of UNAVEM III formed military units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General recommends the resumption of the withdrawal of those units in February 1997 to complete the draw-down within six to seven months.  The intention is to repatriate by mid-June 1997 four of the six UNAVEM III infantry battalions, together with additional support units and some military headquarters personnel, with the remainder of the formed units to be repatriated by the end of July or August 1997. At the same time, the Secretary-General calls for the retention of a rapid reaction force comprising six company-sized infantry groups, one of which would be deployed in each of the operational regions of Angola until the completion of the withdrawal of all military contingents, unless the political and security conditions permit a more expeditious draw-down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report states that the security situation remains volatile in many parts of the country. On the positive side, there have been no major cases of harassment of UNAVEM personnel. As of 28 November, 69,093 UNITA troops had been registered in 15 quartering areas of which 13,115 had subsequently deserted. A total of 29,698 personal weapons and 4,521 crew-served weapons had been handed over by the quartered soldiers. Some 18,738 of the expected 26,300 UNITA troops had been selected for incorporation into the Angolan Armed Forces. As of 28 November, a total of 3,860 out of the expected 4,962 UNITA police personnel had been moved to quartering areas where they are being processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report observes that the duration of quartering well beyond the time- frame set out in the Lusaka Protocol poses a serious challenge to international humanitarian organizations and to the sustainability of the peace process. It is therefore imperative, the report goes on, that demobilization commence in earnest, and that the quartering areas be converted into demobilization centres under the responsibility of the Angolan Government. Approximately 100,000 ex-combatants from the Government and UNITA armed forces are expected to be demobilized. A United Nations operational support plan for demobilization which articulates UNAVEM's exit strategy from the quartering and demobilization phases has been finalized. The plan also envisages the Mission's involvement in recommending safe routeings for convoys carrying demobilized soldiers and their families. In special cases UNAVEM III military and police observers will accompany the convoys, but the Government will have the main responsibility for their safe transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Joint Commission, established under the Lusaka Protocol and including the Government of Angola, UNITA, the United Nations and the observer countries (United States, Russian Federation and Portugal), is to consider proposals by the Government and UNITA on the special status for UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi. The United Nations is still awaiting a declaration by UNITA that it has assembled all its troops and handed over all weapons. While considerable progress has recently been achieved on the military front, the report states that some of the tasks enumerated in Security Council resolution 1075 (1996) and in the consolidated timetable approved by the Joint Commission had not been fulfilled by the 15 November deadline. Those tasks include selection of UNITA troops for incorporation into the Angolan Armed Forces, registration of UNITA policemen and return of all their elected deputies to the National Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNAVEM III continued its public awareness campaign and other activities to promote respect for human rights and to restore confidence and dialogue between representatives of the Government and UNITA at various levels and at fostering national reconciliation, the report continues. With the assistance of Sweden, the Government has begun human rights training for selected personnel as well as for civic education monitors. The issues of human rights violations, governance, public accountability and capacity- building in the field of law and order, deserve increased attention in the present phase of the peace process, it adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the reporting period, United Nations humanitarian activities continued to concentrate on the expansion of programmes to newly accessible areas and on the return of internally displaced persons to their areas of origin, says the Secretary-General. The mine awareness campaign, and mine survey and clearance continued to be conducted by the Angolan demining brigades. A two-year plan for the development of Angola's national demining capacity will commence next January under the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs. As part of the exercise, UNAVEM is considering the transfer of its demining equipment to that project. In his next report, the Secretary-General will inform the Security Council of the details of the transition plan, as well as of the phase-out strategy for UNAVEM III military personnel currently involved in the demining activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General appeals to donors for additional resources for humanitarian assistance to quartered personnel which would have to be provided for a much longer period than initially expected. Significant resources are also needed to assist the large number of refugees, displaced persons and former combatants in resettlement areas. To that end, the Secretary-General urges the donor community to fulfil the pledges they undertook at the 1995 Brussels Round-Table Conference on Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council also has before it a draft resolution (document S/1996/1026), which reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reaffirming its resolution 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991 and all subsequent relevant resolutions,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Having considered the report of the Secretary-General dated 2 December 1996 (S/1996/1000),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reaffirming its commitment to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of Angola,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reiterating the importance it attaches to full implementation by the Government of Angola and the Uniao Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola (UNITA) of the &quot;Acordos de Paz&quot; (S/22609, annex), the Lusaka Protocol (S/1994/1441, annex) and relevant Security Council resolutions,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reminding the Government of Angola and UNITA to uphold strictly, without delay, their obligations under the Lusaka Protocol and the commitments they entered into in Libreville and Franceville,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Underlining the need for respect for human rights, and stressing the need for the Angolan parties to give greater attention to preventing incidents of human rights abuse, investigating alleged human rights violations, and punishing those found guilty by due process of law,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcoming the efforts of the Secretary-General, his Special Representative and personnel of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), the three observer States to the Angolan peace process, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the international community as a whole, and encouraging them to continue their efforts to promote peace and security in Angola,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General dated 2 December 1996;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. Expresses concern at the overall slow pace of the peace process, but notes some positive steps in its implementation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. Decides to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III until 28 February 1997;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. Approves the Secretary-General's recommendation to resume withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units during February 1997 as set forth in paragraphs 30 through 32 of his report of 2 December 1996, with the understanding that the pace of withdrawal will be commensurate with progress achieved in the quartering areas, in demobilization and in the extension of state administration, and that the first phase of withdrawal will begin on schedule in February 1997;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. Authorizes the Secretary-General to commence the gradual and progressive withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units from individual quartering areas prior to February 1997, and to accelerate the withdrawal schedule subsequently, if former combatants vacate the quartering areas in accordance with the Lusaka Protocol and other factors are conducive to withdrawal, without putting at risk the successful completion of the peace process;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. Stresses that both parties must immediately begin to cooperate on integrating selected UNITA officers and troops into the FAA and on demobilizing those remaining in the quartering areas, and underlines the need for the Government of Angola to make available all necessary funds it has pledged and to speed up the processing of demobilization certificates and other administrative matters;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7. Reminds Member States that the need has now become urgent for the financial resources necessary to facilitate the demobilization and social reintegration of ex-combatants through the United Nations consolidated inter- agency appeal for Angola;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8. Calls upon UNITA to cooperate with the Government of Angola in its immediate task of creating integrated FAA and police units which would begin, in the spirit of the Lusaka Protocol and monitored by UNAVEM III, the gradual, orderly and peaceful extension of state administration into areas formerly occupied by UNITA;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;9. Urges the Government of Angola to avoid offensive military operations which go beyond those strictly necessary for the restoration and maintenance of law and order in the areas formerly occupied by UNITA;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. Recalls the need for the President of Angola and the President of UNITA to meet inside Angola at the earliest opportunity and calls on both parties to move rapidly on the political steps towards national reconciliation, including the assumption by UNITA deputies and officials of their posts, followed by establishment of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation prior to 31 December 1996;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;11. Urges the two parties to reach agreement on the special status of the President of UNITA as the President of the largest opposition party before 31 December 1996, without linkage of that issue to the formation of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;12. Calls upon the President of UNITA to travel to Luanda for the creation of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation, and thereafter to maximize the amount of time spent in Luanda in order to enhance confidence in the country's democratic institutions and the irreversibility of the peace process;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;13. Welcomes the continuation of the programme for the disarmament of the civilian population by the Government of Angola, and stresses the need for its full and more effective implementation, including disarmament of the Civilian Defence Corps;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;14. Reiterates its concern over the acquisition of weapons contrary to paragraph 12 of resolution 976 (1995) of 8 February 1995, while the peace process is under way;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;15. Reaffirms the obligation of all States to implement fully the provisions of paragraph 19 of resolution 864 (1993) of 15 September 1993, calls upon all States to make the necessary actions to implement the provisions of paragraphs 19 to 25 of resolution 864 (1993) vigorously and strictly, and expresses deep concern that the failure by States, especially those neighbouring Angola, to do so is inconsistent with the peace process and undermines economic recovery;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;16. Demands that all parties and others concerned in Angola take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of United Nations and other international personnel and premises, including that of non-governmental organizations, and to guarantee the safety and freedom of movement of humanitarian supplies throughout the country;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;17. Calls upon both parties to intensify their demining efforts, and reiterates the need for continued commitment to peace by destruction of stockpiles of land-mines monitored and verified by UNAVEM III, and expresses support for various United Nations demining activities in Angola, including plans aimed at enhancing national demining capacity;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;18. Urges the Government of Angola and UNITA to remove all illegal checkpoints that constitute obstacles to the free circulation of people and goods throughout the country;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;19. Urges the international community to fulfil expeditiously its pledges to provide assistance to facilitate the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Angolan national economy and the resettlement of displaced persons, and stresses the importance of such assistance at this time in order to consolidate the gains in the peace process;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;20. Requests the Secretary-General to continue planning for a follow-on United Nations presence along the lines described in paragraph 33 of his report of 2 December 1996 which would include military observers, police observers, a political component, human rights monitors and a Special Representative, with the aim of maintaining a limited United Nations presence in Angola, and to report thereon no later than 10 February 1997;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;21. Expresses its readiness to consider, in that context, the possibility of sending a Security Council mission to Angola before the expiry of the mandate of UNAVEM III;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;22. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALFONSO VAN-DUNEM &quot;MBINDA&quot; (Angola) said that despite well-known difficulties, there had been substantial progress in implementing key provisions of the Lusaka Protocol. His Government believed that the process was nearing its conclusion. Some hours ago, the President of Angola signed the official appointment of nine UNITA generals, incorporating them into the Angolan Armed Forces. The Government of Angola was making an enormous financial effort to ensure the reintegration of demobilized soldiers. His Government had been shouldering those expenses all along, but those costs should be shared by UNITA and by UNAVEM III. The Government of Angola appealed to all donor nations to honour their commitments from the September 1995 Brussels Roundtable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PEDRO CATARINO (Portugal) said that while he welcomed the recent steps taken by both the Government and UNITA towards the fulfilment of important military tasks under the Lusaka Protocol, the overall pace of the peace process was still very slow. Several important provisions of the Lusaka Protocol remained unfulfilled, and both parties should at once implement the following tasks: integration of selected personnel into the Angolan Armed Forces; effective conclusion of the demobilization process; dismantlement of all illegal checkpoints; and extension of the State administration throughout Angola. He looked forward to firm initiatives from the Government of Angola and UNITA towards national reconciliation, and hoped to see UNITA deputies resume their seats in the National Assembly very soon. He looked forward to the determination of a special status for the President of UNITA. It was also imperative that freedom of movement of people and goods be guaranteed throughout Angola, in order to boost confidence among the population and foster national reconciliation. He was, therefore, concerned at reports of increasing acts of banditry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portugal, he went on, favoured phased withdrawal of UNAVEM III by the Council, following the recommendation of the Secretary-General. It was crucial, however, that the pace of withdrawal be determined by progress achieved in the different phases of the peace process. The strong presence of UNAVEM III had proved to be of key importance to implementation of the peace process. Thus, the withdrawal of United Nations forces must be approached with caution. The good work of UNAVEM III would continue to be vital to the success of the international community's efforts to bring peace to Angola.  Portugal, one of the troika of observer States to the peace process, fully supported the work of UNAVEM III and offered hearty praise for the efforts of the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Alioune Blondin Beye. He hoped that the signatories of the Lusaka Protocol would honour the efforts of the international community and their own commitments, and place the interests of Angola and its people above all else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LEGWAILA J.M.J. LEGWAILA (Botswana) said his Government firmly believed that the acceptance by the Government and UNITA of the fact that there could be no military solution to the conflict in Angola was an important first step on the road to peace and democracy. While the peace process remained fragile and reversible, the fact remained that never before in the country's history had so much been achieved to establish a lasting political solution. He strongly hoped that the Government and UNITA would not waste the historic opportunity to make peace a living reality for their country and people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implementation of the Lusaka Protocol was never intended to be an unending process, he continued. Some of the urgent tasks which had to be tackled expeditiously were: the resettlement of more than 1 million internally displaced persons; demining; road rehabilitation; demobilization and social reintegration of ex-combatants; and the disarmament of the civilian population. Those monumental tasks should be addressed adequately, as they had a direct bearing on the sustainability of the peace process. He supported the Secretary-General's appeal for the establishment of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation before 1 January 1997. It was convinced that its formation would enable the parties to focus their attention on the issues that united rather than divided them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the commencement of the withdrawal of UNAVEM III should not be interpreted as an opportunity to slow down the implementation of the outstanding issues and ultimately the reneging on already agreed commitments and obligations. He supported the proposal to send a Security Council mission to Angola before the expiration of UNAVEM III's mandate. The visit would offer Council members a rare opportunity to observe first-hand the peace process in action and to develop recommendations on the support necessary for post-conflict peace-building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALAIN DEJAMMET (France) told the Council that he would support the resolution before it. That text permitted extension of UNAVEM III's mandate until 28 February 1997 and marked the Council's agreement on the phased withdrawal plan of the United Nations force following the expiration of the mandate. Above all, the resolution once again reminded the Angolan parties, particularly UNITA, that it was up to them to exert the final and essential efforts to implement the Lusaka Protocol. The UNITA's attitude had caused much time to be lost in the two years that had elapsed since the signing of that agreement. But, thanks to continuous pressure from the Council and the tenacity of the Secretary-General's Special Representative, progress had been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a long road lay ahead of Angola after 20 years of destructive war and France was ready to help the Angolan people back to the path of development and progress. His Government had announced in Brussels last September that it was prepared to pay some $110 million towards rehabilitation and reconstruction in Angola. Bilateral discussions with the Angolan authorities were already under way to ensure that the promised aid rapidly assumed concrete form. French aid would be focused on reconstruction projects, but would also have a beneficial effect on the reintegration of demobilized combatants. The French Foreign Minister had visited Angola in late November, and had assured President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the Angolan Government of France's wholehearted support in pursuit of the peace process. He hoped that the machinery for national reconciliation could be set in motion as soon as possible, so that Angola could take its rightful place in southern Africa and rejoin the group of African democratic countries in that region that had undergone radical and exemplary change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QIN HUASUN (China) said the question of Angola had finally been transformed into a positive situation. Recently, the parties had made progress in implementing the Lusaka Protocol. In particular, the goals in the military area were being gradually realized. He was pleased that UNITA had completed the quartering of troops. He expected that the Government of Unity and Reconciliation would soon be established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the development of the Angola peace process, it was necessary to adjust UNAVEM III's mission. In the meantime, however, the presence of UNAVEM III was essential to completion of the various tasks of the Lusaka Protocol and the realization of peace in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that years of war had left Angola in ruins. The international community must help rebuild Angola and continue to support the peace process.  His Government had and would continue to contribute to the reconstruction and peace of Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STEPHEN GOMERSALL (United Kingdom) said that today, perhaps for the first time, it was possible to envisage Angola free of the deep divisions which had characterized that country over the last three decades. The parties should work together, in good faith, to complete remaining tasks and form a Government of Unity and National Reconciliation. His Government welcomed the fact that UNITA had taken the final symbolic step of declaring that it had quartered all of its troops and given up its weapons. The United Kingdom also welcomed reports that the Government of Angola would now proceed to incorporate the nine UNITA generals currently in Luanda into the armed forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be a tragedy if the chance for peace was lost when so much had already been achieved, and when relatively few tasks remained to be completed.  And it would be wrong for either party to give in to temptation or to avoid making final commitments to peace. There was much that the United Nations should do to help Angola with reconstruction, rehabilitation and national reconciliation. A continuing United Nations presence, beyond UNAVEM III, could play a central role in that regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GERHARD HENZE (Germany) expressed great satisfaction that UNITA had issued a formal declaration that all its soldiers had been quartered. A major military aspect of the Lusaka Protocol had thus been successfully implemented.  It now remained for the Angolan Government to initiate the integration of UNITA generals and troops into the regular Angolan Armed Forces. He said the political issues had to be addressed. As the resolution before the Council requested, he urged the Government and the UNITA leadership to resolve outstanding issues before the beginning of the year. There should be a meeting between President Dos Santos and UNITA President Dr. Savimbi in Angola. The special status of Dr. Savimbi should be determined. The State administration should be extended throughout the whole territory. All elected deputies to the National Assembly should return. A Government of National Unity and Reconciliation should be formed, with the establishment of free circulation of people and goods. Time was short. The mandate of UNAVEM III would finally expire in February 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Germany agreed with the Secretary-General that demobilizing and reintegrating ex-combatants and reassimilating internally displaced persons into civil society was among the most critical challenges under the Lusaka Protocol. Germany, as a donor country, felt a particular responsibility in that field. It had launched a pilot project for demobilization and socio- economic reintegration of ex-combatants and the internally displaced. It had already pledged $650,000 for the project and was planning to launch a major project on the same lines, for which it was in principle ready to pledge $4 million as of 1 January 1997. Germany had also contributed significantly in the field of humanitarian assistance. It had provided up to nine demining experts for mine removal activities within UNAVEM III, to support efforts which had resulted in clearing more than 4,000 kilometres of roads from land- mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZBIGNIEW MATUSZEWSKI (Poland) said although he was encouraged by the recent progress in the situation in Angola, a number of important issues remained to be resolved: demobilization of quartered UNITA troops, disarmament of civilian population and completion of the selection of UNITA troops to be incorporated into the Angolan Armed Forces. There was a clear link between the successful fulfilment of those tasks and the creation of a favourable climate necessary for taking up the outstanding political problems. Each party must not make their compliance with their obligations conditional upon the performance of the other side if the peace process was to further advance, he said. It was also important from the point of view of the international community whose continuing involvement in Angolan affairs would be feasible only with both parties faithfully fulfilling their commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOLIMAN AWAAD (Egypt) said that meeting the challenges of peace was essential to the political situation in Angola. Any delay in fulfilling the Lusaka accords would discredit the peace process and hurt the confidence of the people. The incorporation of some 24,000 UNITA soldiers and extension of the authority of the Government into all provinces was essential. He hoped that the upcoming meeting of President Dos Santos and President Savimbi, on Angolan territory, would resolve outstanding political problems, including the special role of Mr. Savimbi and incorporation of UNITA into the cabinet, the parliament and Government at all levels. The UNITA should be a political party operating in full legitimacy and legality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demobilizing some 100,000 soldiers from both sides and reincorporating them into civilian society was a major challenge for the peace process, he said.  His Government supported the recommendations of the Secretary-General regarding the role of the UNDP in that effort. Donor countries should continue to provide financial and technical assistance. He supported the recommendations of the Secretary-General that the military component of UNAVEM III should be extended, consistent with its phased withdrawal through August 1997. The United Nations should maintain its presence, with more emphasis on the civilian, rather than on the military, side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAKARIM WIBISONO (Indonesia) said that although he welcomed the positive developments and initiatives taken by the parties as well as their willingness to work cooperatively, the pace of the peace process remained slow. He reaffirmed the importance for the Government and UNITA to fulfil their obligations in accordance with the Acordos de Paz, the Lusaka Protocol and all relevant Security Council resolutions. Both parties must make progress in the military aspect to provide the necessary impetus for the political aspect to move forward. Once the first stages of the military tasks had been implemented, the parties should begin the process of vacating and demobilizing former combatants in the quartering areas and reintegrating them into civilian society. Those steps required close cooperation among the parties and assistance from the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged both parties, particularly UNITA, to remove all illegal checkpoints which obstructed the free circulation of people and goods throughout the country. He stressed the importance of ensuring the safety of United Nations and other international personnel and premises, as well as guaranteeing the safety and freedom of movement of humanitarian supplies throughout Angola. He hoped the parties would resolve the problem of the return to Luanda of UNITA deputies to the National Assembly, the establishment of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation, the reaching of an agreement on the status of the President of UNITA before 31 December, and extending the State administration throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the international community should fulfil expeditiously its pledges of assistance for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the country's economy in order to consolidate the gains achieved in the peace process. He supported the Secretary-General's recommendation for a gradual withdrawal of UNAVEM III's formed units commensurate with the progress achieved in the peace process. He took note of the Secretary-General's recommendation for a new form of mandate more focused on political, police, human rights and humanitarian activities, including mine clearance, once the military components were no longer needed. That new mandate would permit a follow-up and continuity in United Nations presence to consolidate the gains made in the peace process and ensure a lasting peace in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YURI FEDOTOV (Russian Federation) said that as a member of the troika of observers to the Angolan peace process, his Government believed that conclusion of the process in Angola could become one of the great successes of the United Nations and of the international community. The official statement by UNITA that it had completed the quartering of its forces and handed in its weapons, and the declaration by the Government of Angola that it was willing to incorporate nine UNITA generals into the Angolan Armed Forces, were major announcements that would allow Angola to concentrate on the political challenges before it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Procrastination in fulfilling obligations would only delay the peace process as a whole. The establishment of unified armed forces and police and an acceleration of the demobilization of soldiers were essential. Obviously, the largest peace-keeping operation, UNAVEM III, could not be withdrawn overnight. The Security Council, before the end of February 1997, should dispatch a mission to Angola and make a determination as to the further presence of the United Nations in that country. The Angolan parties should accelerate the peace process and &quot;take it to the finish line&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUAN LARRAIN (Chile) said that the leaders of the Angolan Government and of UNITA should continue to implement outstanding tasks under the Lusaka Protocol. Chile regretted that there had been cease-fire violations and harassment of the troops of UNAVEM III. The fact that the quartering of troops had concluded, and that the nine generals of UNITA would join the Angolan Armed Forces were encouraging. The mandate of UNAVEM III should be extended though February of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHOI SUNG HONG (Republic of Korea) said his Government welcomed that, today, UNITA had formally declared the completion of the task of quartering all its troops and that the Government had initiated the incorporation of UNITA troops, beginning with the nine generals currently residing in Luanda. He hoped that the implementation of crucial military tasks would mark the initiation of genuine reconciliation through political negotiation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The establishment of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation was the next crucial step, he said. All outstanding political issues could be best settled through a tjte-'-tjte between the President of Angola and the leader of UNITA. He urged both parties to show a spirit of maximum cooperation and flexibility for the realization of that meeting and the settlement of all outstanding political issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consolidation of peace in Angola could not be forthcoming without the Government and the international community continuing to make their best efforts to tackle issues related to the increasing need for socio-economic stability in Angola, he said. Close scrutiny of the situation on the ground would be necessary to help consolidate peace in Angola with adequately restructured presence and assistance by the international community. He welcomed the idea of sending a Security Council mission to Angola at an appropriate time to assess the situation and better decide on the pace of withdrawal of UNAVEM III and the procedures for a follow-on United Nations presence. He supported the extension of the mandate of UNAVEM III until the end of February 1997 and its subsequent reduction. He would vote in favour of the draft resolution before the Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALFREDO LOPES CABRAL (Guinea-Bissau) expressed satisfaction over the positive steps taken by the Angolan parties to strengthen the peace process.  He noted the recent announcement by the Government and UNITA to complete talks specified in the Lusaka Protocol. The many delays, however, continued to be a source of concern. Other obstacles must be overcome, without which completion of the peace process would not be possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on his &quot;Angolan brothers&quot; to continue their efforts, and to demonstrate political determination to adopt concrete steps towards the peace process. Peace and prosperity were possible, he said. Angolans deserved to share in the wealth of their country in tranquillity and to participate in its reconstruction and socio-economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community should continue economic and humanitarian assistance, he said. The UNAVEM III still had a role to play. He approved the Secretary-General's recommendation for an extension of the mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GERARDO MARTINEZ BLANCO (Honduras) said delays in compliance with the Lusaka Protocol had caused concern. While there had been progress in the maintenance of the cease-fire, the dismantling of illegal checkpoints and the disarmament of the civilian population and the conclusion of the quartering of UNITA troops, there had been little movement on more political points, such as the establishment of a special status for the leader of UNITA. The parties should strictly comply with their obligations under the Lusaka Protocol, as well as with the directives of the Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Honduras believed the achievements thus far in Angola must be consolidated through the assistance of the international community. The Angolan economy was still in a critical state. Donor countries and the international community should support Angola with a view to consolidating the progress already achieved. A continued presence for UNAVEM III until 28 February 1997 would be essential, and Honduras would vote in favour of the draft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KARL F. INDERFURTH (United States) said that only two months ago the Council had warned the Angolan parties to complete the military tasks agreed to in the Lusaka Protocol and to &quot;get on&quot; with the establishment of a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation. The Council could now feel gratified that there had been significant progress to identify UNITA members for integration into the Angolan Armed Forces, to quarter UNITA forces in Cabinda and to dissolve UNITA's military command structure. But, he was concerned that many quartering camps were full of UNITA troops scheduled for integration into the Angolan Armed Forces or for demobilization. The success of the quartering programme thus far was owed in large measure to the presence of UNAVEM III forces at those camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The time had come for the camps to close and for UNAVEM III to begin withdrawal, he said. The Government and UNITA should take steps to deploy integrated units in areas formerly occupied by UNITA. The draft resolution before the Council contained an urgent message for the international community -- that the present critical stage of the peace process in Angola could not proceed without funding. The international community should move immediately, so that demobilization could be completed within the three months programmed by the Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAOLO FULCI (Italy) said that the next step in Angola was the integration of selected UNITA troops into the Angolan Armed Forces. The Government had taken a major step in that regard by announcing the incorporation of nine UNITA generals into the Angolan Armed Forces. The parties should now concentrate on quick implementation of the political aspects of the Lusaka Protocol. The steps to be taken so far had been postponed, pending settlement of military issues. Now, there could be no more procrastination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Government fully supported the paragraphs of the draft resolution which allowed the reduction of military units of UNAVEM III. They struck a delicate balance between the need to ensure the successful conclusion of the peace process and to avoid prolonging excessively the Organization's most expensive peace-keeping operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action on Draft</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft resolution was adopted unanimously as resolution 1087 (1996).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MACHIVENYIKA MAPURANGA (Zimbabwe) said that despite the two years that had elapsed since the signing of the Lusaka Protocol, the peace process had not come of age. He shared the critical observation of the Secretary-General that the peace process continued to progress in fits and starts. Particularly disturbing was the fact that, even at this late stage, progress had often come only in response to increased pressure from the international community, particularly on UNITA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peace process had reached a critical stage, he said. Statistics on cantonment, demobilization and reintegration could not alone impress either the people of Angola or the international community. It was a crucial juncture, and he joined the people of Angola in demanding and expecting no less than landmark decisions on the part of the Government of Angola and UNITA. For the people of Angola, the disquieting news of the imminent expiration of the mandate of UNAVEM III must be counterbalanced by unprecedented breakthroughs in the peace process. He appealed to all who could contribute to facilitate the return to Luanda of UNITA deputies to the National Assembly and the establishment of a government of national reconciliation. A meeting in Angola between President Dos Santos and Mr.  Savimbi would be most timely at this stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until today, he said, he had intended to demand that UNITA should be pressured to make the expected declaration that all UNITA soldiers had been quartered and that it had no more weapons or military equipment in its possession, in order to remove the obstacles to the extension of State administration throughout Angola. However, he had learned, belatedly, that such a declaration had apparently been issued, a typical example of the refusal of UNITA to make a positive move until heavy pressure was exercised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the end of the two-year period foreseen in the initial mandate of UNAVEM III approached, the countdown towards completion of that operation could only be gradual and progressive, he said. The people of Angola would remain restless until the respite offered under the Lusaka Protocol was transformed into a long-lasting peace. The countries of southern Africa held fast to the dream that had led to the commitments of the Lusaka Accord and demanded that those commitments be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARTIN ANDJABA (Namibia) said the Government of Angola and UNITA should be encouraged to make additional efforts to speed up the pace of the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol. Namibia was fully committed to ensure the restoration of lasting peace and stability in Angola. It was concerned about the desertion of UNITA troops from the quartering areas. The UNITA's failure to make a declaration on the assembly of its troops and the handing over of all their weapons had created doubts about their commitment to the Lusaka Protocol. Namibia called upon the UNITA leadership to ensure a return of their troops to the quartering areas without delay. The UNITA should also make the declaration requested of it in accordance with Security Council resolution 1075 (1996) as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Namibia was also concerned about the delay in the settlement of outstanding political issues, namely the return to Luanda of UNITA deputies to the National Assembly, the status of the UNITA leader and the establishment of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation. His Government agreed with the Secretary-General's recommendation that UNAVEM III's mandate be extended. It was imperative, he said, that the international community and the Security Council, in particular, demonstrated greater commitment and determination to help the Angolan people resolve the outstanding political issues. The Council should send a clear message to the parties, particularly UNITA, on the consequences of obstructing the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia called upon the international community to mobilize all necessary resources for the rehabilitation of Angola's economy and the reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life. Namibia had contributed $5,000 to the United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for Angola last August and would continue its support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CELO LUIZ NUNES AMORIM (Brazil) said that at the end of the two-year period envisioned for the UNAVEM III mandate, much was left to be done. Many UNITA troops had deserted quartering areas and the quality and quantity of weapons turned in by them was unsatisfactory. But his Government welcomed the announcement by UNITA that it had completed quartering and by the Government that it would integrate nine UNITA generals into the Angolan Armed Forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in Angola was in a critical phase. The Secretary-General had outlined a plan for a withdrawal of UNAVEM III's military component, but Brazil believed that that drawdown should take place only when it was clear that the move towards peace was irreversible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PETER L. KASANDA (Zambia) said the Lusaka Protocol had opened the way to peace and stability in Angola. Regrettably, the obligations of the Protocol had not been fulfilled. While the onus was on both sides, UNITA and its leader Mr. Savimbi bore special responsibility in carrying out his responsibilities in a timely fashion and without having to wait for international pressure. The people of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) had put a high premium on the success of the peace process in Angola. Peace would bring benefits to the entire region; Angola would then be able to concentrate on rebuilding its economy so that it could make a better contribution to the SADC as coordinator for the energy sector of the region. Angola was the only country in southern Africa still grappling with internal conflict. The international community should not lose patience with the peace process in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAYE WAH MICHEL WAN CHAT KWONG (Mauritius) said implementation of the Lusaka Protocol had proceeded laboriously and progress had been recorded only when pressure was brought to bear on the parties. The party mainly responsible in that protracted process, UNITA, could be induced to take significant measures only when the situation was due to be reviewed by the Council. &quot;Two steps forward, one step backward&quot; appeared to be the tactic employed by UNITA to delay or evade the complete respect of its community, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Council should consider applying some of the measures against UNITA as envisaged in its resolution 1075 (1996), notwithstanding UNITA's recent declaration, which needed to be verified, that it had quartered all its troops and surrendered all the weapons and military equipment in its possession. While UNITA had made some positive gestures, one should question whether those efforts were genuine. The past did not seem to vindicate UNITA's sincerity. Angola would continue to need the firm support of the international community during the peace process and long after it finally achieved normalcy. He hoped the donor community would respond generously to the appeal for continued assistance in accordance with the pledges made at the 1995 Brussels Round-Table Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CARLOS DOS SANTOS (Mozambique) said UNITA's compliance with the tasks enumerated in Security Council resolution S/1996/844 of 11 October, and its confirmation of the compliance by a written declaration, would allow the peace process in Angola to move into the next stages. He urged members of the Council to ensure that UNITA complied with the agreements it had entered into and abided by the decision of the Council. The people of Angola deserved better than what was being offered. They needed assurances that they could go back to their areas of origin and rebuild their villages and communities without fear of another outbreak of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said southern Africa wanted an Angola in peace, so that it could be a strong partner in the region's quest for integration and development.  Mozambique would continue to lend its solidarity and support, working in concert with other countries of the region, until peace became an irreversible reality in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAUDI MWAKAWAGO (United Republic of Tanzania) said that as the world commemorated the second anniversary of the Lusaka Protocol, it was heartening to note that the temporary upward trend in the number of cease-fire violations in Angola had gone into reverse. In addition, there had not been any major cases of harassment against UNAVEM III personnel. That positive trend needed nurturing by all parties to the conflict, under UNAVEM's skilful supervision. Other developments were equally encouraging, such as the quartering process of UNITA troops and the hand-over of weapons, although according to the Secretary-General's report the United Nations was still awaiting official word from UNITA that it had assembled all troops and handed over all weapons. As the report noted, the expiration of UNAVEM III's present mandate should inspire the concerned parties to carry out all their obligations dutifully and responsibly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He commended efforts under way in the relief and rehabilitation process, particularly in the return to their homes of internally displaced persons.  The socio-economic reforms currently in progress in Angola should be encouraged and strengthened, he said. The launching last June of the New Life Programme had been a milestone in addressing the country's economic problems.  The importance of the International Monetary Fund-sponsored emergency programme -- supported at a later stage by a three-year structural adjustment programme -- need not be overemphasized. Those efforts should be complemented by the international community. He welcomed and supported the draft resolution before the Council, particularly the proposal to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III until 28 February 1997. He also supported the gradual withdrawal of UNAVEM III military units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PERCY MANGOAELA (Lesotho) said the countries of the SADC would not falter in their resolve to bring the Angolan peace process to the front burner in their regional and international engagements. Lesotho was encouraged by the positive developments in Angola reported in the Secretary-General's report and urged the parties to spare no effort in fulfilling all the tasks enumerated in Security Council resolution 1075 (1996). Expressing regret that some sporadic incidents had continued to slow the peace process, he appealed to the parties to refrain from any acts that might negatively affect it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peace in Angola should be given a chance, he said. Lesotho supported the extension of UNAVEM III's mandate until 28 February 1997 and the reduction of the residual force over a six-month period after that date. Implementation of a programme of economic reconstruction would be a more challenging task.  Lesotho expected that the United Nations would not abandon Angola and would play a key role in that task, and in ensuring peace and economic prosperity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By extending UNAVEM III's mandate, the Council would demonstrate that, while it was prepared to continue to support the peace process, the parties should also demonstrate their commitment to fully implement the Lusaka Protocol and Council resolutions on Angola without delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHIPHUSIZI JELE (South Africa) said the peoples of southern Africa believed that the sustaining of the democratization taking place in the region depended on the achievement of durable peace and stability in Angola. His delegation appreciated the progress made in Angola on disarming the civilian population, the surrender of weapons by quartered troops, verification by UNAVEM III of phased-out UNITA regional command structures, and the dismantling of illegal checkpoints. Those developments were important and should be sustained. The cessation of hostilities by the parties was crucial to the creation of a climate conducive to the evolution of peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The views of civil society should be harnessed in the promotion of issues of national concern and interest. His delegation applauded public education programmes aimed at fostering national reconciliation. It believed a meeting between Angolan President Eduardo Jose Dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi was long overdue, and that it would serve as a welcome opportunity for the two leaders to map out the way forward. Proposals on the future of the UNITA leader deserved encouragement. He hoped urgent measures would be taken on the incorporation of UNITA army officers into the Angolan Armed Forces and of its deputies into the National Assembly. South Africa supported the extension of UNAVEM III's mandate and hoped steps would be taken to ensure that the gains already achieved remained in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOROTHY THUNYANI (Malawi) said it was clear from the two reports before the Council that many aspects of the Lusaka Protocol remained to be accomplished for peace to be fully established and for the war-tired people of Angola to resume their normal lives. Since time was of the essence, the days ahead were critical, and would require magnanimity and extra resolve from all concerned.  She urged all the parties, particularly UNITA, to carry out all their obligations under the Lusaka Protocol in good faith and within the agreed time schedules. She implored them to desist from any moves that might negatively affect the gains already achieved and indeed jeopardize the whole peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the plans of the Secretary-General regarding the downsizing of UNAVEM III military units, she said she had every confidence in the Secretary- General's judgment, and looked forward to his further elaboration of those issues in his next report to the Council. His reports were also quite clear on the resources required to carry out the many activities aimed at bringing Angola back to normalcy. While thanking the international community for assistance so far rendered to Angola, she joined the Secretary-General in inviting the donor community to fulfil the pledges made at the 1995 Brussels Round-Table Conference. In the short term, such assistance could only help ensure that the peace currently existing in Angola could hold. She supported the proposed extension of the mandate of UNAVEM III.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOMINGOS FERREIRA (Sao Tome and Principe) said that implementation of the Lusaka agreement had reached a point of no return, as too much effort and hope had been applied by the parties and by the international community. Some aspects of it had not yet been implemented. Yet, without resolving all military aspects and achieving general security, political issues could not be resolved. Among those issues were the return to Luanda of UNITA deputies to the National Assembly, establishment of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation, and establishment of a special status for the leader of UNITA. The demobilization of troops in Angola and their reintegration into society was also an important issue and donor countries should provide additional resources to support that vital programme. If they did not, Angola would face spreading urban insecurity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLEVELAND, United States (PANA) - As the captain of the Nigerian under-23 soccer team at the Atlanta Games, Nwankwo Kanu's two spectacular goals in the competition's semi-finals helped Nigeria clinch the soccer gold, the country's first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, as a recovering heart patient at the 75-year-old Cleveland Clinic in the American state of Ohio, Kanu has turned to those same goals to uplift his spirit and help in his recovery process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With less than a minute to go in that semi-final match between Nigeria and Brazil, Kanu collected the ball in the opponents' 18-yard box and flipped it past hapless defenders even as he had to turn almost 180 degrees for tactical reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal drew Nigeria level at 3-3. Then, Kanu went ahead to score the &quot; golden goal&quot; that gave Nigeria the match.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting in a room in the 11,000-worker hospital complex a thin smile creased his face as he watched a video tape of that match. That changed to a broad smile as the images of him celebrating his first goal flashed across the screen of a 19-inch television set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thank God for seeing me through the surgery, and I hope to go back to the sport soon,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu has been discharged from the hospital where he underwent four hours of surgery to repair a heart valve which doctors say was defective from birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defect, diagnosed by Kanu's Italian club doctors at Inter Milan as a valvular insufficiency of the aorta, threatened his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However the doctors who performed the surgery have pronounced it a success.  The prognosis is good for a speedy return to the pitch for the 20-year-old star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My doctors have said that I will recover fully and could return to the sport...by February if I follow my rehab well,&quot; he told a visiting Nigerian delegation recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, he needs to settle his 100,000-dollar hospital bill and begin his graduated rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian government has already approved about 50,000 dollars for the bills and is expected to consider the player's appeal for further assistance since his rehabilitation bills will also run into several thousands of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu, tall with long, almost oversized limbs, has already started the first stage of rehabilitation. This includes daily workouts on a treadmill at the hospital's Rehabilitation Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyday he trades his navy blue bathrobe for a track-suit and a blue cap inscribed with the letter &quot;K&quot;, as the takes the elevator from his 14th-floor room to the rehabilitation center on the first floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet for the full rehabilitation, which will involve swimming and jogging, he has been scheduled to travel to a sports-oriented facility in California, thousands of miles away from Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cleveland facility is a non-profit academic medical center which has treated 75,000 patients from at least 100 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors at the clinic and his managers are not saying much in terms of when Kanu will return to sport, seemingly concentrating on restoring his health first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are taking it step by step,&quot; his manager, Franklin Sedoc, said. &quot;That's how we handled it when Kanu first learned about his heart condition and that's how we will approach his rehabilitation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cleveland Clinic cardiologist John Kramer said that Kanu's surgeon, Dr.  Bruce Lytle, decided to repair the defective valve rather than replace it.  This is designed to improve Kanu's chances of returning to soccer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, sources close to the hospital are more emphatic, saying that while the doctors are being cautious, they believe that the Nigerian international will go back to the sport in which he has recorded an impressive achievement even at 20 years of age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently named African Footballer of the Year for 1996, Kanu's past soccer glories include helping Nigeria's under-17 team to victory in Japan in 1993 and Dutch club Ajax Amsterdam to several titles, including the European Champions Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether he will come back to win more laurels remains to be seen but Kanu is not giving up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not finished,&quot; he said when the news of his heart problems broke. &quot;No one knows what the future holds but you have to fight for what you believe in.  I just want to get back to the pitch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Within a decade, Gambia has managed to vaccinate all its children against hepatitis B, a doctor from that nation has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the just-ended sixth working group meeting of the Children's Vaccine Initiative (CVI), Gambia was mentioned, together with Botswana, South Africa and Swaziland, as countries which had succeeded in &quot;sustaining hep B immunization within the EPI&quot;, or the Expanded Programme on Immunization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hepatitis B vaccine was originally developed to respond to the very high incidence of primary liver cancer in developing countries, as a result of chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Abdoulie Jack of Gambia's Medical Research Council Laboratories, Banjul, said the smallness of the country's population was a factor in its 100- percent vaccination coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, if we managed to do it, other countries can do it as well provided there is stringent management of the resources available, including cold chain systems, doses, vehicles and logistics,&quot; he told PANA in Dakar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that all African countries had the potential as Gambia to attain the same degree of cover against hepatitis B so long as the task was made part of their primary health care systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gambian surgeon Ebrihim Samba said poor management of resources for the vaccination programmes, in African countries, was regrettable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some countries, it is not surprising to find EPI vehicles being used to ferry fish,&quot; said Samba, the World Health Organization Regional Director for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that massive international funding for vaccination programmes in Africa had not been matched by results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of money and the reluctance of funding agencies to pump more of it into hepatitis B programmes were cited as reasons for the low levels of vaccination in some countries, although 74 nations have included hepatitis B vaccine within their EPI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Peter Ndumbe, of the Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Studies at Yaounde University, Cameroon, said funding agencies opted to give priority to poor countries which showed sustainable immunization programmes against other diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that besides inadequate money for hepatitis B, there had been problems in mobilizing resources for eradicating yellow fever, whose resurgence has been observed over the last five years in sub-Sahara Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a paper on the &quot;New Approaches To Vaccine Introduction,&quot; he said that 31 West, Central and Eastern African states were &quot;at risk of the urban and jungle cycles of epidemic and endemic yellow fever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yellow fever outbreaks, he said, were reported in Sierra Leone and Benin in 1996. In Benin, he added, 60 percent of the children who died &quot;had been fully immunized with the six routine EPI vaccines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To deal with the problem of inadequate funding for EPI, another document presented at the Dakar meeting urged governments to establish separate budgets for vaccination programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It called, also, on donors to direct their resources toward the vaccine independence initiative, so as to reduce dependency on external funds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Sudan's Ministry of the Interior confirmed Wednesday that former Prime Minister Sadiq Al Mahdi had left the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State radio and the government-run Sudan News Agency quoted the ministry as saying that &quot;Mr Sadiq Al Mahdi has disappeared from his home since Monday and later on it became clear that he is now outside the country.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry was reacting to a news reports Wednesday that Mahdi was now in Asmara, Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that Mahdi, who has opposed President Omar El Bashir's plan to impose Islam's Sharia laws on the nation, had not been forced to leave the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is common knowledge that Mr.Sadiq El Mahdi has been enjoying the freedom of movement and used to attend all occasions without any restrictions, &quot; said the ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahdi, an Oxford educated politician who was prime minister from 1986-1989, remained in Sudan despite his ouster in a bloodless coup in 1989 by Gen. Omar El Bashir. Mahdi refused to join the Sudanese opposition exile communities in Cairo, London or Asmara. He has said, often, he preferred a &quot;civil struggle&quot; to an armed confrontation in removing Bashir's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, opposition parties in exile including Mahdi's UMMA (freedom) Party joined recently with the anti-government Sudan People's Liberation Army of John Garang. They formed an allied army to fight the Bashir government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent government reports from Khartoum said the opposition forces, based in neighbouring Eritrea, had on many occasions attacked border army posts and planted mines which have killed or wounded many people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadiq El Mahdi is the great great grandson of Muhammad ibn el- Sayyid Abdullah who in 1883 defeated major Egyptian and British forces who tried to impose Egyptian rule over Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi (PANA) - A Burundi government delegation left Bujumbura Thursday for Arusha, Tanzania, accompanied by representatives of three minor parties that backed the coalition of Hutu President Sylivestre Ntibantunganya, overthrown in the July 25 military putsch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informed sources at Bujumbura airport said the government team consisted of Foreign and Cooperation Minister Luc Lukingama, Planning Minister Minani Evariste, Minister of State for Cooperation Havyarimana Leonidas, as well as advisers from the president's and prime minister's offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation will take part in a session aimed at ending the ethnic crisis that has bedevilled Burundi since October 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airport sources said, however, that representatives of the Hutu-dominated majority party, the Burundi Democratic Front (FRODEBU) were prevented from boarding the plane that would have flown them to Arusha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contacted by telephone, the FRODEBU spokesman, Bavuginyumvira Frederic, told PANA in Bujumbura that the border police had prevented him and the party's secretary general, Nzojibwami Augustin as well as the speaker of the national assembly from taking the flight to Arusha &quot; on orders from the attorney general.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bavuginyumvira said he was not aware of the motive behind the police action &quot;which deprives a big portion of the population the opportunity of being represented at the Arusha negotiations upon which they had placed a lot of hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRODEBU backs the embargo that has been imposed by neighbouring eastern and central African states to force Burindi's military regime to return the country to constitutional rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two FRODEBU leaders prevented from going to Arusha forthrightly back the sanctions, which have already cost Burundi some 200 million US dollars, according to latest government figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tutsi-dominated opposition parties have also not sent any representatives to the Arusha intra-Burundi talks. These had said in advance that they did not believe the mediator, former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, was neutral. They have demanded the appointment of a new &quot;arbitrator.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking before his departure for Arusha, Rukingama told journalists that &quot; we shall not start negotiations because our pre-condition is the lifting of economic sanctions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi is confronted with an armed rebellion by guerillas from the majority Hutu ethnic group, which is fighting the Tutsi military government that took power last July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 150,000 people have been killed in the conflict between the two ethnic groups since the first democratically-elected President Melchior Ndadaye was assassinated by Tutsi soldiers on Oct. 21, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest figures issued by humanitarian organisations indicated that more than 1000 people were assassinated in November.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Sudan's President Omar Bashir has belittled the recent escape of former Prime Minister Sadik el-Mahdi to neighbouring Eritrea, saying it will not threaten his government nor affect its islamic orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahdi's escape and his joining the opposition &quot;will not scare us nor will it obstruct the advance of our Islamic cultural orientation,&quot; the Sudan News Agency (SUNA) quoted Bashir as saying.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was addressing a graduation ceremony Wednesday for 7,500 university students who have completed military training at the popular defence forces camps in Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahdi, who was ousted by Gen. Bashir in a bloodless coup in 1989, escaped to Eritrea where an armed Sudanese opposition group has recently been active.  He has reportedly joined hands with John Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) to fight for the downfall of the Bashir regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese ministry of the interior on Wednesday confirmed that Mahdi had disappeared from his home since Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime minister from 1986-1989, he had decided to stay in Sudan since the coup and did not join the opposition in exile in Cairo, London or Asmara. He has often shrugged off violent means as a way of removing the government, saying he preferred &quot;civil struggle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the contract, the Zambia Electrity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) is expected to earn about 1.3 million U.S dollars each month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The power trading agreement was signed by senior officials from the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), Zaire's Societe National d'Electricite (SNELl) and the hosts, ZESCO.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Less than a week after a peace agreement was signed by the Government of Sierra Leone and the armed opposition Revolutionary United Front (RUF) to end a bloody internal conflict, more than 150 civilians have been brutally mutilated and killed in the north of the country, Amnesty International said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There should be an immediate monitoring of human rights in Sierra Leone as only then there may be some hope of bringing such atrocities to an end,&quot; the organization said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is calling for a human rights verification commission, with the support and participation of the international community, to be immediately established. It should include international human rights observers with the expertise and credibility necessary to monitor human rights effectively while the peace agreement is being implemented.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Failure to do this could seriously undermine the efforts which have been made during 1996 to bring peace and an end to human rights violations in Sierra Leone and which resulted in the signing of a peace accord on 30 November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days after the peace accord was signed, the villages of Kubehuna and Magbenka, in Tonkolili District, Northern Province, were attacked by armed men. The villagers, forced to flee their villages because of the conflict, had begun to return to their homes. According to eye-witnesses, the attackers entered the villages and began firing at civilians or attacking them with machetes. Some villagers -- mostly women and children -- died after being forced to enter a house which was then set alight. Other victims had arms and legs cut off. As in previous similar killings, the identity of the perpetrators of the atrocities in Kubehuna and Magbenka was unclear: survivors were unable to say whether it was government soldiers or rebel forces who attacked them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This latest atrocity is consistent with the torture, ill-treatment and killings of unarmed civilians which have characterized the conflict in Sierra Leone since it began in 1991, but particularly since 1994 when it developed into a campaign of violence directed against civilians. The identity and motives of those carrying out attacks on civilians became increasingly difficult to establish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 30 November the Sierra Leone Government and the RUF signed a peace agreement in Cote d'Ivoire. The agreement called for the immediate cessation of hostilities, the demobilization and disarmament of the RUF and its integration into the national army. A neutral monitoring group, with the participation of the international community, is to be established to monitor breaches of the cease-fire provided by the peace agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest atrocity in Tonkolili District emphasizes the urgent need for monitoring of the cease-fire to be accompanied by a human rights verification commission to monitor adherence to the human rights standards referred to in the peace agreement, including those guaranteeing right to life and the right not to be tortured and ill-treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1996 Amnesty International published a report, Sierra Leone: Towards a future founded on human rights, which made concrete recommendations to the Government of Sierra Leone, to the RUF and to the international community to build on commitments to respect human rights. As well as effective monitoring of human rights, it called for effective control to be exerted over both government soldiers and RUF forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International also stressed the importance of clarifying the truth about human rights abuses -- by both government soldiers and rebel forces -- during the conflict. True reconciliation cannot be achieved if the right of victims and their families to truth and justice are ignored.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kisangani - In my capacity of Archbishop of Kisangani, Zaire I desperately launch an appeal to the powers of this world and to political decision makers to assist the population of Kisangani, Upper Zaire, and of Maniema, as well as the hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced people wandering in North and South Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For over a month, the great powers and political decision makers, on whom the fate of all humanity depends, have been unable to make up their minds.  With the reinforcement of the media, the United Nations adopted a resolution to send to Eastern Zaire a multinational military force, with a humanitarian mission to include providing security for aid corridors and organizations charged with the distribution of food and medicine. Only a portion of the refugees have returned to Rwanda; however, to believe public opinion (and contrary to the simplest calculations) the</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mission decided upon by the UN has become useless!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This evasion and hesitation have led to the inevitable flux of refugees, displaced people, and panic-stricken populations towards Kisangani or deeper within the forest, which will only create further insecurity in the region.  To our great surprise, no one speaks of these refugees and displaced people anymore. However, think of the misery and distress, the desolation and death among these people, among whom only the strongest can continue their journey!  Beyond any doubt, these hesitations constitute an imminent danger for the several million inhabitants of Kisangani and neighboring dioceses, whose numbers will soon be increased by the arrival of those displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, with the fall of Butembo-Beni and the sacking of Bunia, both sources of food for Kisangani, and with the sharp reduction in river traffic towards Upper Zaire, this city is in danger of a famine of unimaginable magnitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, acting as the voice of the voiceless, I appeal to the decision makers of the world and in Zaire to resolve to bring aid to Kisangani and all victimized regions of Zaire, by urgently sending food an medicine, whose transport and distribution should be secured in an efficient manner. Persuade that you are affected by the same sentiments, I ask you to accept this expression of my distinguished consideration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome - EASTERN ZAIRE: A joint UN/NGO/Government of Zaire mission visited the Shabunda/Kindu area, some 175 km west of Bukavu, and flew at low altitude around the Lubutu/Walikale/Bukavu area. The mission found approximately 10, 000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees in the town of Shabunda and up to 40,000 in two camps around Shabunda. An additional 20,000 to 30,000 refugees were reported in Walikale and 10,000 to 15,000 refugees in Lubutu. WFP is presently studying the possibility of putting a team together to assess the needs of the population around Shabunda and attempt to distribute needed food commodities. Access to this area is very insecure and may require assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The northern axis from Goma continues to be closed to all international humanitarian workers. Access to the western and southern routes as far as Kalungu (some 50 km west of Goma) is permitted. Assessment missions as far as Kitchungu, half-way between Sake and Masisi, have been undertaken by the UN, however the terrain and pockets of resistance are unknown and thus deemed unsafe for further travel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 26 November, WFP has distributed approximately 27 metric tons of mostly high-protein biscuits, as well as some pulses and maize, to over 25, 000 returnees on their way back to Rwanda, as well as to Zaireans requiring assistance near or in Goma town. WFP is currently distributing biscuits at way stations on the western and northern axis. Field assistants, driving in the area to assess needs, also carry small quantities of biscuits that can be distributed to vulnerable groups as needed. The ration distributed is 500 grams of high-protein biscuits, representing 2,290 kcal/person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The food supply situation in Goma is limited with a reduction in the number of trucks arriving to the town leading to a price increase of 66 per cent for imported goods. Vegetables and fruits have also witnessed a sharp rise in price by some 150 per cent. This is mainly caused by food production areas in the high lands being inaccessible due to insecurity. The ongoing fighting forced most of the population to flee to other areas leaving their farms, which for the most part were destroyed and looted during their retreat. Also with the repatriation of refugees, the cost of labour has escalated. WFP is studying the food requirement situation in the region with particular emphasis on food security and the means to reestablish the previous supply network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TANZANIA: It has been reported that 10,000 to 13,000 refugees, who wish to return to Rwanda as a group from the Ngara camps, have asked UNHCR for transportation for children and other vulnerable groups. This group plans to return in the next few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 1,900 and 800 refugees repatriated from Ngara respectively on 10 and 9 of December. These refugees were provided with transportation for their return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports continue to be received that refugees in Tanzania are preparing to leave. Markets in and around the camps have seen a dramatic drop in the price of clothing, as people sell their belongings. It has also been noted that food prices have remained stable, implying that returnees may be planning to bring their food stocks, from the recent distribution, with them to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consultations between the Governments of Tanzania and Rwanda, and UNHCR are being planned in Ngara on 12 December, concerning the repatriation of refugees to Rwanda from Tanzania. Other UN agencies, including WFP, and NGOs will also likely take part in the consultations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RWANDA: Since 15 November, WFP and NGO partners (CARE, CRS, LWF, World Vision, Concern, CRR, IFRC, Trocaire, Caritas, ADRA, MEC, GAA, AHA, World Relief, AEF, EEF, IRC, MSF, ASS, Salvation Army, Ingabo) have distributed approximately 9,457 mt of food commodities (cereals, pulses and oil), representing 566,287 persons assisted with a monthly ration. In addition, 1, 256,600 daily high-protein biscuit rations have been distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP stocks in Rwanda for the returnee programme are currently at 3,964 mt (2,886 mt cereals, 735 mt pulses, 209 mt vegetable oil and 134 mt of salt).  In Kibungo prefecture, where stocks are currently being built up in preparation for a possible inflow of returnees from Tanzania, stocks stand at 259 mt in the warehouse and 552 mt prepositioned in the communes. The process is ongoing and within one to two days WFP will have prepositioned enough food in that prefecture for the possible return of 340,000 persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN agencies and NGOs met with the Prefet of Kibungo to finalise preparations for the possible return of refugees from Tanzania. In the event of a mass return, way stations will be used. Three NGOs, IFRC, RRC (Rwandan Red Cross) and World Vision, will be responsible for the way stations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Some 35,000 refugees in Tanzania's Ngara region have left Kitali camp, but instead of returning to Rwanda as expected, they went further into Tanzania, WFP said. At a crossroads, where they could have headed for Rwanda, they turned instead towards Isaka in north-central Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further north in Karagwe, 7,000-8,000 refugees are reported to have left the camps to establish unofficial settlements. WFP said they had been told they would not receive aid as long as they were outside the system, but they replied that they did not care. The refugees have said they will not return to the camps, nor to Rwanda. Yesterday, UNHCR said some 23,000 refugees had fled the Karagwe camps away from the Rwandan border following a campaign of intimidation by Hutu extremists. Some are reported to have returned to the camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Requests for repatriation to Rwanda by refugees in Tanzania's camps have dropped off substantially, according to a report yesterday from the DHA Information Centre in Kigali. The only request of importance came from up to 13,000 Muslims in the Ngara camps who want to return on Saturday. In Lumasi camp, 445 refugees who had registered to return, reportedly changed their minds and rumours are said to be circulating throughout the camps that the repatriation has been called off.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief agencies have launched aid airlifts to help stranded refugees in eastern Zaire, ICRC announced. AFP reported that an ICRC C-130 Hercules plane flew from Nairobi yesterday with aid for the Shabunda region, where groups of some 100,000 refugees have been spotted, and another flight left today, ICRC said. An ICRC spokesman, quoted by AFP, said shipments - comprising mostly high energy biscuits, medical supplies, plastic sheeting and blankets - were flown to Kindu, and will be tranported on to Shabunda using smaller planes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Archbishop of Kisangani, Monsengwo Pasinya, has appealed to world leaders not to forget the plight of hundreds of thousands of displaced people and refugees wandering around in eastern Zaire, and warned that Kisangani was consequently facing &quot;imminent danger&quot;. He pointed out that only a portion of the refugees had returned to Rwanda, and the &quot;evasion and hesitation&quot; shown by the world community had resulted in a flow of &quot;panic-stricken&quot; people towards Kisangani or deeper into the forests. &quot;No-one speaks of these refugees and displaced people anymore,&quot; he said. &quot;Beyond any doubt, these hesitations constitute an imminent danger for the several million inhabitants of Kisangani and neighbouring dioceses, whose numbers will soon be increased by the arrival of those displaced. Furthermore with the fall of Butembo-Beni, and the sacking of Bunia, both sources of food for Kisangani, and with the sharp reduction in river traffic towards Upper Zaire, this city is in danger of a famine of unimaginable magnitude.&quot; Acting as the &quot;voice of the voiceless&quot; , he appealed for urgent aid to the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bunia still appeared to be in government hands yesterday, after local Radio Candip which broadcasts from the town, transmitted new stories in line with the authorities' stand. The radio, monitored by the BBC, broadcast news of Mobutu's imminent return and remarks by the justice minister on improving the human rights situation in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire said yesterday it was not aware of any negotiations to bring in mercenaries to fight alongside its army, but it did not rule out seeking military help from allies to regain rebel-captured territory. &quot;If we are obliged to work with even the devil himself we will do so in order to win back Zaire's territorial integrity,&quot; Information Minister Boguo Makele told Reuters. He added however that the time for such military help had not yet arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavy fighting again broke out on the Uganda-Zaire border yesterday, the Ugandan 'New Vision' newspaper reported today. It said some 1,000 Ugandan soldiers battled about 500 rebels from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in the Ruwenzori mountains which straddle the border. At least 16 rebels were reported killed in the operation which was aimed at dislodging them from their mountain hideout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Burundi, two main Tutsi parties have rejected mediation in the country's ethnic conflict by former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere and both refused to take part in peace talks, due to open in Arusha today. The main opposition party, Uprona, accused Nyerere of bias and slammed the continued regional economic embargo against Burundi. &quot;Given the situation created by the measure, as illegal as it is unjust, of imposing a total blockade against Burundi...  and the biased attitude (of Nyerere) regarding terrorist and genocidal organisations...it is no longer open to us to accept his invitations,&quot; said a letter from Uprona president Charles Mukasi. The leader of the Tutsi- dominated Rally for Democracy and and Economic and Social Development (RADDES) , Joseph Nzeyimana, also turned down the invitation. To date, it was not known exactly who would attend the talks. A spokesman for Burundian leader Pierre Buyoya, speaking on BBC radio, said the government would participate in the talks but would not negotiate with &quot;killers&quot; or those espousing a &quot; genocidal philosophy&quot;. These groups must first renounce killings, and then the government would talk to them, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,000 people were massacred in Burundi in one month between late October and late November, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso said yesterday. According to Ayalo Lasso, most of the victims were killed by soldiers. &quot;The human rights situation in November can be described as alarming with its wave of massacres, arbitrary arrests, looting and destruction of property,&quot; he said in a monthly report, quoted by AFP. The report said killings were mostly carried out by the army but Hutu rebels were also responsible. The return of tens of thousands of Hutu refugees from Zaire was partly to blame for the increase in tension, the report stated.  Particularly volatile areas were said to be the provinces of Kayanza, Bururi, Cibitoke, Gitega, Ruyigi and Bujumbura-Rurale. A government spokesman said on the BBC that the authorities were investigating reports of massacres but had found nothing to substantiate the accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judicial system in Rwanda remains heavily overloaded, with only 20 defence lawyers for some seven million inhabitants and increasingly overcrowded prisons, a report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said yesterday. UN observers recorded 82,200 prisoners in the country's 192 detention centres, with 23,200 new detainees in the period January-November.  Among them are 3,000 women and over 2,000 adolescents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a senior Rwandan army officer appeared before a military court in Kigali yesterday accused of allowing the massacre of displaced people at Kibeho camp in southwest Rwanda in April 1995. Rwandan radio said the trial of Lt.Col Fred Ibingira was adjourned until next Thursday after the defendant and his lawyer rqeuested more time to prepare his defence. An AFP report said Ibingira is accused of not taking the necessary decisions to stop the killings and save the displaced people under his protection. The massacre occurred after RPA troops moved into the camp to close it down.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome - TANZANIA: With the assistance of the multi-national force led by Canada, WFP plans to airlift some 100 metric tons of corn-soya blend for camps in the Kibondo district of Kigoma region starting tomorrow. This airlift is to target a highly nutritious food commodity to mostly newly arrived Burundian refugees who are in poor condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">646 refugees repatriated to Rwanda on 11 December, which is approximately one-third of the total repatriated on 10 December. Reports of negative propaganda are reported to be hindering the process of repatriation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RWANDA: On 11 December WFP and NGO partners (CARE, CRS, LWF, World Vision, Concern, CRR, IFRC, Trocaire, Caritas, ADRA, MEC, GAA, AHA, World Relief, AEF, EEF, IRC, MSF, ASS, Salvation Army, Ingabo) distributed approximately 287 mt of food (cereals, pulses and oil), representing 17,185 people assisted with a monthly ration. The cumulative total distributed now stands at 9,743 mt, representing 583,413 persons assisted with a monthly ration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP stocks in Rwanda for the returnee programme are currently at 3,937 mt (2,734 mt cereals, 845 mt pulses, 178 mt vegetable oil and 180 mt salt). In Kibungo prefecture, where stocks are currently being built up in preparation for a possible inflow of returnees from Tanzania, stocks stand at 219 mt in the warehouse and 616 mt prepositioned in the communes. WFP continues to preposition enough food in communes of Kibungo for the possible return of 340, 000 persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To increase needed storage space in Rwanda, a storage tent of 500 mt capacity is being transferred from Goma to Kigali. WFP continues to expand the storage capacity at the commune level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next week WFP Byumba sub-office staff will visit all communes to meet with NGOs, local leaders, beneficiaries and women's groups to identify food-for-work projects. The projects will target returnees as well as local vulnerable populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EASTERN ZAIRE: WFP Goma was interviewed on the Voice of America this morning. The broadcast was translated into Kyniarwanda and French. WFP reported that more than 600,000 refugees had already returned to Rwanda and encouraged those refugees remaining in Eastern Zaire to return. WFP also announced that it had sufficient food commodities available for their return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the 10 and 11 of December, a total of approximately 2,500 refugees crossed the border from Goma to Gisenyi. The returnees came partly through the Virunga forest and partly from the Minova/Numbi direction. Some 400 refugees were reported to have returned through the Bukavu/Cyangugu border point yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the shoppers talked to, as they jostled around the shop, said it was the nicest thing that had happened in their city over a long, long time adding that they had expected the new shop to have opened its doors to the shopping public earlier than today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many were just happy to mill around looking at the shelves neatly packed with reasonably priced consumer goods from Zambia and other parts of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prices appear to be reasonable and the shop is quite well stocked and neatly stacked on the shelves,&quot; an old man visiting the shop in the company of his son remarked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Company General Manager, Mauritz Alberts in an interview said the shop had opened with an initial capital of R1.8 million (about K509,400,000) and it took four weeks to prepare well for the opening sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new shop has employed 76 Zambians including the branch manager, George Mweemba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Alberts said Shoprite Checkers aims to keep reasonable prices and good stocks backed up by an efficient service adding that the retail chain has already offered contracts to Zambian farmers and other suppliers for food stuffs and general merchandise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the seventh Shoprite Checkers shop in Zambia after the ones opened in Lusaka, Kabwe, Kitwe, Ndola, Mufulira and Chingola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Livingstone residents, however, complained that most of the 76 workers had come from the Copperbelt instead of from among the local people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Bankers Association chairman, Bill Erwin, yesterday assured non-bank investors in treasury bills that the new Bank of Zambia regulations do not affect them in any way and they would continue to be catered for under the commercial banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of Zambia on December 5, announced that with effect from Tuesday, December 3, it would transfer the retail trading in treasury bills and bonds to the commercial banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore, only commercial banks will participate in the primary dealings with Bank of Zambia and in turn the banks will deal with the public and other institutions at the secondary level. The off-tender treasury bill window will cease to operate and the rediscount facility offered to non-banks will be discontinued. The commercial banks will, however, offer these facilities to the non-bank investors,&quot; read the Bank of Zambia statement in part.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erwin said the change in regulations had nothing to do with commercial banks' own participation in the treasury bill auction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Up until now companies and individuals could deal directly with Bank of Zambia if they wished to purchase treasury bills. This is unusual as most central banks do not deal with the public. Under the new rules these have to deal with a commercial bank who will consolidate orders on behalf of their clients,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in a report presented on Tuesday, the Zambia Coalition on Debt and Development (ZCDD) held commercial banks partly responsible for the near stagnation of the Zambian economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The heavy involvement of commercial banks in treasury bills has reduced their traditional role of financial intermediates. They have opted to maximise their profit earnings by holding government debt. The high interest rates and the free risk nature of this type of debt makes it extremely attractive. Commercial banks would therefore be unwilling to lend to businesses which comparatively are more risky than the treasury bills. The effect is a slow down in the growth of the economy,&quot; said the report.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambia Coalition on Debt and Development (ZCDD) has called for transparency in Zambia's debt situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting a report on Zambia's debt situation at an Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ) meeting on Tuesday, David Musona, Suya Chidumayo and Gertrude Ngenda who had been working with the African Forum and Network on Debt and Development (AFRODAD), said that the country's debt problem has been chronic for many years now and requires a solution both in the short and long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their report reveals that Zambia's total external debt stock in 1970, at US$654 million, had increased to US$6,543 million, by December 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This represented 240 per cent of Gross National Product(GNP) and the scheduled debt service was 51 per cent of foreign exchange earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report stated that Zambia's foreign exchange earnings have remained at an average of $1,200 million per year since 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another important feature of Zambia's debt problem is that more than 95 per cent of the loans are held by government. This has raised the fiscal burden of debt, that is, the pressure of debt repayment on the government budget,&quot; said the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recommending possible solutions to the debt burden, the report urged that Zambia and other African countries in the same predicament should take a common approach in negotiations with multilateral lending institutions instead of their current individual stances which had only served to weaken their positions further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also advised that Parliament should begin to play a more active role in approving loans and monitoring Zambia's debt situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our belief that loan resources should be properly apportioned to the service and productive sectors. Borrowing for the social sector in the absence of a growing productive sector is irresponsible,&quot; said the report. &quot; We recommend that the Zambian Government be more transparent regarding negotiations on Debt relief by providing information beyond the published annual reports.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi (PANA) - A Burundi government delegation left Bujumbura Thursday for Arusha, Tanzania, accompanied by representatives of three minor parties that backed the coalition of Hutu President Sylivestre Ntibantunganya, overthrown in the July 25 military putsch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informed sources at Bujumbura airport said the government team consisted of Foreign and Cooperation Minister Luc Lukingama, Planning Minister Minani Evariste, Minister of State for Cooperation Havyarimana Leonidas, as well as advisers from the president's and prime minister's offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation will take part in a session aimed at ending the ethnic crisis that has bedevilled Burundi since October 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airport sources said, however, that representatives of the Hutu-dominated majority party, the Burundi Democratic Front (FRODEBU) were prevented from boarding the plane that would have flown them to Arusha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contacted by telephone, the FRODEBU spokesman, Bavuginyumvira Frederic, told PANA in Bujumbura that the border police had prevented him and the party's secretary general, Nzojibwami Augustin as well as the speaker of the national assembly from taking the flight to Arusha &quot; on orders from the attorney general.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bavuginyumvira said he was not aware of the motive behind the police action &quot;which deprives a big portion of the population the opportunity of being represented at the Arusha negotiations upon which they had placed a lot of hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRODEBU backs the embargo that has been imposed by neighbouring eastern and central African states to force Burindi's military regime to return the country to constitutional rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two FRODEBU leaders prevented from going to Arusha forthrightly back the sanctions, which have already cost Burundi some 200 million US dollars, according to latest government figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tutsi-dominated opposition parties have also not sent any representatives to the Arusha intra-Burundi talks. These had said in advance that they did not believe the mediator, former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, was neutral. They have demanded the appointment of a new &quot;arbitrator.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking before his departure for Arusha, Rukingama told journalists that &quot; we shall not start negotiations because our pre-condition is the lifting of economic sanctions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi is confronted with an armed rebellion by guerillas from the majority Hutu ethnic group, which is fighting the Tutsi military government that took power last July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 150,000 people have been killed in the conflict between the two ethnic groups since the first democratically-elected President Melchior Ndadaye was assassinated by Tutsi soldiers on Oct. 21, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest figures issued by humanitarian organisations indicated that more than 1000 people were assassinated in November.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt. Col. Fred Bingira, who appeared before the court Wednesday, has been charged for not preventing the killing of 300 people in the said camp, which his battalion had been sent to cordon off.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court, chaired by Lt. Col. Munyakazi, includes five majors and a second lieutenant. It reconvenes Dec. 19.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Sudan's President Omar Bashir has belittled the recent escape of former Prime Minister Sadik el-Mahdi to neighbouring Eritrea, saying it will not threaten his government nor affect its islamic orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahdi's escape and his joining the opposition &quot;will not scare us nor will it obstruct the advance of our Islamic cultural orientation,&quot; the Sudan News Agency (SUNA) quoted Bashir as saying.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was addressing a graduation ceremony Wednesday for 7,500 university students who have completed military training at the popular defence forces camps in Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahdi, who was ousted by Gen. Bashir in a bloodless coup in 1989, escaped to Eritrea where an armed Sudanese opposition group has recently been active.  He has reportedly joined hands with John Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) to fight for the downfall of the Bashir regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese ministry of the interior on Wednesday confirmed that Mahdi had disappeared from his home since Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime minister from 1986-1989, he had decided to stay in Sudan since the coup and did not join the opposition in exile in Cairo, London or Asmara. He has often shrugged off violent means as a way of removing the government, saying he preferred &quot;civil struggle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zimbabwe is to import a total of 250 megawatts of electricity from Zaire and Zambia under a tripartite power export contract signed in Lusaka on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the contract, the Zambia Electrity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) is expected to earn about 1.3 million U.S dollars each month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The power trading agreement was signed by senior officials from the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), Zaire's Societe National d'Electricite (SNELl) and the hosts, ZESCO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, ZESCO's Chief Executive Robinson Mwansa, who signed for Zambia, said the agreement was made under Southern African Development Community Power Pool (SAPP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under short-term contracts, ZESCO would export 100 megawatts of electricity to Zimbabwe while SNELl would channel 150 megawatts to Harare using the Zambian network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The three utilities bring to SAPP their electrity trading experience and have taken a lead in implementing the SAPP agreements thereby bringing enormous savings to the customers in the region,&quot; Mwansa was quoted in the statement as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the power export agreement would last until Zimbabwe is able to obtain power from Cahora Bassa hydro-electric dam in neighbouring Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement was signed by the ZESA executive, Simbalashe Mangwengwende while Vika Dipanzu did so for SNEL.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (PANA) - The trend of corruption in Tanzania partly stems from low wages and inadequate fringe benefits which fail to satisfy workers needs, according to a recent report issued here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The over 500-page report, handed over to President Benjamin Mkapa, also blames unscrupulous businessmen who have corrupted top officials to win government tenders and favours, especially tax evasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mkapa said the report &quot;only gives scientific ways on how to deal with and eradicate corruption,&quot; the public and the media have gone further and suggested that measures should be taken against top officials cited in the report as being corrupt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, the majority of Tanzanian public servants are forced to demand bribes in order to make ends meet. This could be corrected by better incomes and wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it accuses high ranking officials with access to many facilities of resorting to corruption because &quot;they want to accumulate wealth.&quot; High ranking officials under the previous government of President Ali Hassan Mwinyi have been named as corrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the country's finance minister, Prof.Simon Mbilinyi, was recently forced to resign following an uproar in parliament over reports that he had been bribed to give tax exemptions to local businessmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, compiled by a team of nine commissioners, headed by former Prime Minister Joseph Sinde Warioba, states that the colonial era laws on corruption, which was adopted in 1958, was full of loopholes. The commission was set up in January 1996 to also review the law, regulations, procedures and the mode of operations in the government and parastatal organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the report, whose compilation took 11 months, notes that the public institutions set to wipe out corruption, including the judiciary, were corrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The public, because they need services, are forced to give out bribes but they don't like it,&quot; says part of the report, quoted by the Tanzanian News Agency (SHIHATA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministries and departments singled out in the report as being corrupt include those of education, health, home affairs, treasury, judiciary, attorney general's chambers, trade and industry, lands, natural resources, tourism and public works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report has not spare the media either, which should, in principle, help in exposing corruption. In two lines, it affirms that the Tanzanian media have been infested with &quot;cheque-book journalists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To clamp out corruption, the president has to summon reports of all top officials tarnished by corruption and all top government official should declare their property,&quot; the report suggests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - A former Zambian vice-president in Kenneth Kaunda's government, Maiza Chona, on charges of &quot;falsely alarming the public&quot;, was acquitted Friday by a Lusaka magistrate because he had &quot;no case to answer&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was charged after issuing a statement in the supreme court on Nov. 14 that &quot;a bomb had been planted at former President Kaunda's residence in Lusaka.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chona had made the statement before a full supreme court bench which was then hearing a petition filed by opposition parties challenging President Frederick Chiluba's citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former vice-president, who is a lawyer, claimed that two of the witnesses they intended to call to challenge Chiluba's citizenship had received parcel bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was summoned to court Tuesday to answer the charges. His lawyers, however, argued that there was no way Chona should be summoned to court when he had not been formally arrested and charged with the offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Principal Resident Magistrate Francis Nsokolo said in his ruling that the reasons for issuing the summons to Chona were wrong as well as the procedure that was used by the state in order to secure his attendance of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I dismiss the charge against the accussed person,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SINGAPORE, (PANA) - The just-ended World Trade Organisation (WTO) conference in Singapore has delivered a win-win outcome for developing countries which in the past five days resisted Western attempts to link labour standards with trade privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Led by the United States, industrialised member countries of the WTO had demanded that core labour standards be put on the WTO agenda, which would have for the first time put the WTO in direct confrontation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But over 120 speakers who presented speeches at the conference were unanimous that labour issues were not in the realm of the WTO and should instead be discussed within the ILO.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe and other member countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) also took a strong stance against the issue, saying it could cause unnecessary confrontation among member states and cloud the vision of the WTO in its quest to liberalise global trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US and the European Union countries found themselves fighting a losing battle, with developing member countries of the WTO accusing the West of trying to impose their rules on weaker nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the closing ceremony WTO ministerial conference chairman, Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister Yoo Cheow Tong, emphasised that labour issues were best dealt with by the Geneva-based ILO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the ministerial declaration recognised that the ILO was the competent body to set and deal with labour standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It rejected the use of labour for protectionist purposes which he said was very important for safeguarding the multilateral trading system, particularly for developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said ministers had also agreed that the comparative advantage of low- wage countries &quot;must in no way be put into question (and) does not inscribe the relationship between trade and core labour standards on the WTO agenda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheow emphasised the WTO would not undertake further work on the relationship between trade and labour standards, implying the subject was unlikely to be raised at future WTO meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the meeting, the first to be held since ministers signed the WTO agreement in Marrakech, Morocco in April 1994, has been hailed by delegates as an important milestone in laying the foundation for future co-operation between the rich and poor countries in removing tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade and investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The conference has provided a strong political message underlining opportunities in the new global economy, while ignoring the challenges that our economies face,&quot; the Singapore trade minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The message this conference has sent is one of confidence in the multilateral trading system as it approaches its 50th anniversary in 1998 and in its ability to promote growth and guarantee stability,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also expected to benefit from the outcome of the conference would be the so- called least developed countries, which many delegates said were in the danger of being permanently left behind as the rest of the world moved towards global economic integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their declaration, the ministers pledged to provide more technical assistance to ensure that the countries, ranging from Afghanistan to Zambia, successfully implemented Uruguay Round commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richer countries would explore ways of granting preferential duty-free access for the exports of least developed countries, particularly for clothing and textiles.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Gold production by the Ashanti Goldfields Company (AGC) at the Obuasi mine fell slightly in the last 12 months ending Sept. 30, 1996, as compared to the same period in 1995, the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995 gold production stood at 932,323 ounces, while that for 1996 dropped to 883,853 ounces. The company had earlier projected that production will hit the one million ounces mark.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Sam E. Jonah, chief executive of AGC, the low gold production reflected the drop in production from the surface mines as well as the treatment of larger tonnages of ore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shift in emphasis from the surface to higher grade underground ore has been initiated and continues to be the focus of the new management,&quot; he said in Accra Thursday in an interim report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, said &quot;1996 has been a milestone year for the company, a year in which it has been transformed from a gold producer with a single mine in Ghana to a group with several operating mines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company now has &quot;major development projects and an exploration portfolio that includes land positions on each of the most promising gold mineralisation belts of sub-Saharan Africa,&quot; Jonah added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It moved rapidly in the last six months to add value to the former Cluff properties that were acquired in January, increased exploration and development at Freda-Rebbecca in Zimbabwe leading to a 17 percent increase in reserves and eight percent increase in gold production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the company's earnings in 1996, the report shows it earned 70.9 million U.S. dollars representing 33 percent lower than the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earnings were depressed, particularly in the last six months by the high operation costs of the Obuasi mine which is focusing on surface mining operations,&quot; it adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next five years will see the company seeking to transform the underground mine into a bulk tonnage and mechanised mining operation that will double ore production to 3.5 million tonnes a year, the report notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company made a profit of 71.4 million dollars as against 105.8 million dollars for 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashanti's shares are currently listed on the Australian Stock Exchange which adds up to its existing listings in Accra, Harare, London, New York and Toronto.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition parties charged that Chiluba lied about his nationality when he filed electoral nomination papers last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioning parties are the United National Independence Party (UNIP) of former President Kenneth Kaunda, the Liberal Progressive Front, the National Congress and Agenda for Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State senior counsel, Mainza Chona, who is one of the lawyers for the petitioners confirmed to PANA Friday that he had received a letter from Chisulo informing him about the costs being asked before the hearing takes place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The solicitor general is demanding 49 million kwacha from us. I think the fee is wild and exorbitant,&quot; Chona said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solicitor general's demand has been described as &quot;wild and outrageous&quot; by some political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal Progressive Front chairman, Rodger Chongwe, said that the fee was exorbitant for an appearance in court. He claimed that the objective was to frustrate Zambians so that Chiluba's nomination was not challenged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chisulo should not kill these proceedings by demanding an outrageous sum of money. It is a cheap ploy to kill the petition that no government employee should engage in,&quot; Zambia Democratic Congress deputy secretary Azwell Banda charged, adding that the demands were political and unprofessional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week before the Nov. 18 polls, the four parties filed a petition asking the court to order postponement of the elections until the question of Chiluba's nationality was resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That petition was dismissed after the court ruled that it was premature and contrary to the provisions of the electoral law, which requires that a petition be filed within 14 days after the new president has been sworn-in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four parties then filed a fresh petition after the elections on Nov.29.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - The Organization of African Unity (OAU) Friday said Africa was unable to act in the crisis in eastern Zaire due to the failure of the international community to provide it with effective means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa has had to stand by and watch the unfolding of yet another crisis which at one time threatened to have a possible humanitarian catastrophe,&quot; the organisation's secretary general, Salim Ahmed Salim, said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attributed this to &quot;a combination of developments in eastern Zaire itself and the inability of the international community to take speedy and timely action to help stabilize the situation&quot; despite the commitment made by the leaders of the Greater Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim was opening a seminar on peace-making and peace-keeping for the OAU staff, organized by the New York-based International Peace Academy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nine-day seminar, which will provide advance training for senior OAU staff involved in conflict prevention, management and resolution, is co- sponsored by the OAU with the support of the government of Denmark, whose minister for development cooperation is also participating.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THERE'S a story of a Western explorer in Africa whose bearers sat down at the side of the path after carrying his goods for some hours and refused to continue the journey, despite his urging. They were resting, they said, so that their souls could catch up with their bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Meschach Ogunniyi, the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation's (Unesco) chair at the School of Science and Mathematics at the University of the Western Cape, used this example last weekend to pinpoint one barrier to public acceptance of science and technology.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have all had the feeling, after periods of rapid change, of needing to digest our experience and make sense of it all. But in the highly technological societies of the 1990s, people may feel they can never catch up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This feeling, Ogunniyi argued, is a particularly strong element when societies try to develop a sci-tech ethos in Africa. &quot;The body has prospered, but the soul and spirit have continually sought for repose outside the realm of science and technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogunniyi was giving a paper on the effects of science and technology on traditional cultures at a conference in Bellville, Cape Town, on the public understanding of science and technology. Participants included sci- tech educators, scientists, engineers and other interested people from all over Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They gathered to ponder the problem of social attitudes towards a sector little understood and often viewed with suspicion, and to debate possible solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discussions in-cluded a good deal of self-analysis, too, with scientists admitting to failings of their own in effectively communicating with others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the problems lie deeper than communication, as several papers noted: there is a clash of cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogunniyi pointed out that, in traditional communities, knowledge that comes from authority takes precedence over knowledge that is empirically observed.  But science is defined by its strict adherence to the observable, measurable world, and scientific cultures accord this kind of knowledge the kind of respect traditionally given to the elder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, said Ogunniyi: &quot;In traditional cultures, there is no sharp demarcation between the physical and the spiritual.&quot; Unlike Western societies, African communities don't separate the visible and invisible worlds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So could a shift to a sci-tech ethos threaten traditional belief systems and damage social structures? And does the issue boil down to a simple choice between cultures?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants didn't think so. Some described culture as dynamic, adapting all the time to integrate foreign elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others cited Japan, where a strong traditional culture coexists with technological advancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Margaret Keogh of the University of Durban-Westville argued that no discussion should define science and technology simply as &quot;Western science&quot; and ignore what she termed &quot;indigenous science&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She defined it as commonsense knowledge gained informally, but still science because it relies on observable data. Understanding local weather patterns or using plant remedies would fall into this category.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keogh argued that indigenous science can be used as a way into teaching science, and that the separation made between informal and formal knowledge is not helpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any public awareness programme for science and technology, she said, needs to take indigenous science into account and thoroughly root itself in the local social context. This means consulting learners, rather than imposing a world view on them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE shortcomings of the media have been much commented upon by President Nelson Mandela this year, most memorably when he criticised our fraternity for failing to solve the country's political crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend he further compounded our sense of collective inadequacy by denouncing the press for failing to use &quot;scientific analysis&quot; - a shortcoming which led us (in his opinion) to the false conclusion that the African National Congress is an &quot;authoritarian&quot; organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At risk of being accused of peeking at matric answer papers, we would hazard that by &quot;scientific analysis&quot; Mandela is referring to the scientific method - involving observation, measurement and experimentation, and the formulation, testing and modification of hypotheses. If so, we would petition for a re-mark, because our hypothesis seems fairly well substantiated by the ANC's record in office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authoritarian streak in the ANC was first observed in the abrupt firing of Pallo Jordan as minister of posts and telecommunications, in March this year. We noted at the time that this followed various disagreements between Jordan and the president over issues including government interference in the broadcasting services, a proposed dilution of civil rights to fight crime and an attempt to foist favoured candidates for the National Executive Committee (NEC) on the ANC congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the basis of that evidence we constructed the &quot;authoritarian&quot; hypothesis.  Jordan was, of course, reappointed to the Cabinet, tempting us to modify the hypothesis. But, measured against the subsequent actions of the Mandela administration -- the moves to &quot;crush&quot; Bantu Holomisa and the replacement of Terror Lekota in the Free State by the NEC without regard for democratic niceties - the hypothesis seems to stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True to the rigorous demands of the scientific method, we are of course prepared to modify our hypothesis in the light of further evidence; if, for example, Lekota is returned to the post for which he seems to have been well- suited and the ANC abandons what smacks of a petty persecution of Holomisa.  But, at the same time, we must object to the white coats of scientific certainty in which Mandela would dress us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is much to be respected about the scientific community, we cannot help but sympathise with the wise-crack made by another president, John F Kennedy, that life is extinct on other planets because their scientists are in advance of ours. And, after all, it was Albert Einstein who once made the observation that the whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking. In other words, common sense, Mr President.  It is the only value on which we would be judged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - ZAIRE'S cancer-ridden president, Mobutu Sese Seko, was carried to his latest television interview on a stretcher. Propped up in a chair in the plush French villa he may never leave, Zaire's despot was prodded into bursts of lucidity in a futile attempt to pretend that he is still in control of his war-ravaged nation and will one day go home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month President Jacques Chirac of France was in Africa, making an equally vain effort to persuade his country's former colonies that its influence on the continent is not withering with Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France has stood by powerless as one of the nations central to what Paris considers its domain in Africa has imploded. Rwandan soldiers, Zairean rebels and Ugandan troops have driven Mobutu's army from large swaths of eastern Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not that Paris does not wish to intervene. It did all it could to try to engineer international approval for a force similar to the one it led into Rwanda in 1994 in an attempt to keep that tragic nation under Paris's wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That move backfired badly, not only producing a government in Kigali deeply hostile to France, but also laying the ground for the civil war in Zaire. But this time France was forced to confront new limits to its neo-colonial adventurism in Africa. The US ambassador to Zaire, Daniel Simpson, put succinctly the new realities. &quot;France is no longer capable of imposing itself in Africa,&quot; he said in an interview with a Zairean newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Neo-colonialism is no longer tolerated. The French attitude no longer reflects the reality of the situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris spluttered its protest, but its former African colonies took note at a Francophone summit in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, last week. Although they went along with Chirac's call for a multinational force to protect civilians in eastern Zaire, it was a token demonstration amid an unusual air of defiance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France, more than any former colonial power, has maintained ties that bind Africa. It props up regional currencies and economies in return for markets and investment. But the relationship also helps France to maintain its self- perception as a major power, especially at the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underscoring French resolve that its former colonies should remain loyal is a deep- seated fear of the spread of Anglo-Saxon culture. But Chirac appears to have recognised that the days of French unilateral intervention in Africa are over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week he told Zaire's Prime Minister, Kengo Wa Dondo, that France would help to drive out foreign forces, but only when Zaire had &quot;restructured its army&quot;, an unrealistic hope according to rueful French diplomats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three years ago President Mobutu would only have had to ask, and French troops, advisers and equipment would have been defending Mobutu Sese Seko's cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The naked self-interest of French intervention in Rwanda in 1994 put paid to all that. Paris was not alone in standing by while hundreds of thousands of Tutsis were murdered. But it continued to support the extremist Hutu regime which oversaw the genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three months after the slaughter started, Paris persuaded the UN Security Council to authorise it to occupy western Rwanda, ostensibly to save Tutsis.  But it was far too late. Almost all the Tutsis in the region were dead or gone. In reality, France was making a last bid to prop up the defeated Hutu regime against Rwandan Tutsi rebels whom Paris viewed as little more than an Anglophone front because the bulk of the leadership had been raised in English- speaking Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris was not only unable to prevent the collapse of the former government, but it also laid the groundwork for the present crisis in eastern Zaire and the undermining of France's influence in Africa. French soldiers helped to provide an escape route for soldiers of the defeated Hutu army and extremist militias into Zaire, where they used the refugee camps to attack and threaten the new Rwandan government. The Tutsi-led government responded with the recent invasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If eastern Zaire has demonstrated the new limits on French adventurism in Africa, it was the US that willingly drew the line. The US orbit in Africa has grown since the end of the Cold War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October, Washington and Paris got into a spat over sarcastic remarks by a junior French minister about the first trip to Africa by the then US Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, shortly before the American election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the real tension lay elsewhere. A few days earlier, France had frustrated US plans for a standing African intervention force, saying it was ill thought out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time Rwanda invaded eastern Zaire, the US was more than willing to block French adventurism. Paris pushed to lead an intervention force, again claiming it was only motivated to save civilian lives. But Chirac recognised that the political climate would not permit France to act on its own, and to others, including Britain, it smacked too much of 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French Foreign Minister, HervG de Charette, accused the Americans and the British of being spineless and, by extension, racist for failing to want to help Africans. But Washington was buying time for its Rwandan allies to whip their opponents in Zaire and, in &quot;the process, lay to rest French aspirations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - WATER and Forestry Affairs Minister Kader Asmal is under fire in KwaZulu-Natal from organisations across the political spectrum over his ministry's decision to allow some 3 000ha of ecologically fragile land on the Drakensberg escarpment to be planted with commercial pine trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental organisations, some of whose members have historical links with the anti- apartheid movement, along with officials in the Inkatha Freedom Party, argue that the water-guzzling forest could dry up wetlands in the area and deprive local farmers and communities of water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The row centres on a decision to allow Inzinga Ranch in the Mpendle district of the Drakensberg the right to establish a commercial timber forest close to the road between Nottingham Road and Himeville.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Cooper of the Natal Branch of the Wildlife Society says the forest will inevitably damage a sensitive part of the Drakensberg catchment area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know plantations affect biodiversity 100% but this could also affect the water supply for hundreds of thousands of people lower down in the catchment area.&quot; He added that the green light for Inzinga would open the way for other damaging forestry programmes in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meridy Pfotenhauer from Bergwatch said there &quot;are 80 to 90 applications for forestry in the Drakensberg&quot; and no proper land-use plan to ensure that the region's natural resources are used and protected in a co-ordinated way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFP senator Philip Powell said his party is concerned about the forestry plan in a sensitive area &quot;where there are lots of streams and small rivers that feed rivers in the province&quot;. While rural people in the Mpendle area were desperate for jobs, they were also concerned about water supply in dry years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell said it appeared the Natal Midlands were being targeted by the forestry industry because commercial plantations in the Eastern Cape have been severely disrupted by industrial protest and militancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although some Inkatha officials are opposed to the forestry permit for Inzinga, Powell stressed it was important to come up with another form of economic development that would offer jobs and benefits to the people who live there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earthlife Africa representative Marion Witte, whose organisation has members more aligned to the ANC camp, said Inzinga Ranch's application for a permit had been a &quot;completely untransparent process&quot; and that over 20 objections had been lodged to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claas Triebel, a deputy director general in Asmal's department, said the row reflected how contested the control and use of water in South Africa had become.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The permit had been issued after 18 months of study and consultation in the area and &quot;careful consideration of the impact such development would have on the water resources of the immediate community&quot;. Inzinga has also promised to build a dam to ensure safe water supply for local people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with a growing controversy, Asmal has decided to call a meeting early next year of all affected by the permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting will form part of a strategic environment assessment that aims to plan the regional economy of the Midlands in a way that will try to accommodate the conflicting views and interests. This will probably be the first time such a planning process is used to solve an environmental conflict in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My sense is that it is a very important step forward and a concession that the ministry has made,&quot; said Chris Albertyn, national coordinator of the Environmental Justice Networking Forum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THERE is a moment in the making of the Constitution when Sheila Camerer of the National Party asks, &quot;What are universally accepted fundamental rights? Perhaps we need a workshop to discuss them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a moment way back in early 1995 in the days when the Constitutional theme committees were clearing the undergrowth in the drafting of the new constitution. The pruning came much later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This theme committee is discussing fundamental rights. Kadar Asmal, constitutional lawyer and minister of water affairs, replies: &quot;You might not know what universally accepted fundamental rights are, but we do. We've been fighting for that all our lives. The National Party might need a workshop, but we in the ANC don't.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a moment even before that when, at the ANC's Ready to Govern conference in 1992, a comrade stands up during the health policy discussion and asks whether homosexuality should not be discussed under health. No, replies Barbara Masakela, then an administrator in Nelson Mandela's office and now ambassador to France, because that is a human rights issue - not a health issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These have been some of the defining moments in the making of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its guidelines were the constitutional principles negotiated in 1993. Now, says Fink Haysom, who has spent this year being presidential law adviser by day, constitutional trouble-shooter and drafter by night, &quot;we have one of the most advanced Bills of Rights. Experts in democratic countries look with considerable envy at our Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why? There is an equality clause that covers, among other things, race, gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, disability, culture, religion, birth and language. There is the right to bodily integrity and freedom to make decisions about reproduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is the right to a healthy environment, the right of access to health services, water and housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is substance and there are words. There are the words in the hotly disputed sub-clause (8) of the property clause that, notwithstanding the right to own property, the state can make laws to achieve land and water reform to redress past racial discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asmal is delighted at the water part. Freedom Front MP Constand Viljoen says the clause is wide enough to turn an ox-wagon around in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Words do count,&quot; says Halton Cheadle, a labour lawyer and critical backroom boy in the drafting process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One night, a week before the May 8 deadline, Cheadle hands Cyril Ramaphosa, Constitutional Assembly chair, a document. Ramaphosa reads: &quot;The rights in this Constitution are limited only to the extent that they are limitable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He smiles, but cracks up later as he gasps his way through this: &quot;In a spirit of decency and propriety, all organs of state must remain in their own functional areas and not encroach in the functional areas pertaining to other organs.&quot; Has the moral high ground been lost?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More serious words immunised the Labour Relations Act (that allows a lock- out) against constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitutional Court said no, the Constitution must be the supreme law.  New words said every employer can engage in collective bargaining. That means using economic power, maybe even a lock-out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Labour thinks they've won because there's no lock-out clause. The employers think they've won because individual employers can engage in collective bargaining,&quot; says Cheadle. &quot;I don't want to be the one to wake them up, but there's no one winner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So many words, but there is little doubt that the substance of the new Constitution has been shaped by the ANC. The other parties reacted to our proposals, says ANCnegotiators, we were putting proposals on the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is even a tacit admission of this from National Party leader FW de Klerk, on May 8, adoption day, he says that the NP had improved many original proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Democratic Party's Tony Leon now says, thanks to the DP's intervention, the constitution is &quot;less worse&quot; than it could have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just like the ANC's Willie Hofmeyr, speaking in the early morning on adoption day after negotiators had just clinched the first deal on the lock- out: &quot;No one is really happy with this, but the fact that we are all a little unhappy should make everyone a little happier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a long moment in the making of the Constitution when posters go up: &quot;The new Constitution will be written by the most important person in the country: YOU.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slogan is plastered on buses. Domestic workers travel on these buses out of town, past Parliament, to their white homes. Will they write the Constitution?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This moment is filled with words, millions of words that come from the public. Some two million submissions are collected, acknowledged, bound by the Constitutional Assembly staff. Most are to do with rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People want rights. Sometimes they want to stop other people from having rights. There is little interest in what fascinates the politicians, which are the structures of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bill of Rights is only one part of the Constitution,&quot; says Haysom. &quot; But a constitution is a way of regulating the way in which society makes choices. In terms of structures of government it has the most nuanced and comprehensive elaboration of democracy yet to be found anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Germans envy the way provincial legislators have been brought into the body politic, the Canadians envy the system of co-operative federalism because their federal system has paralysed them, and American liberals envy the fact that our president is accountable to Parliament, unlike theirs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the people - those who write in, anyway - want to speak about rights.  Police should have no right just to enter your home, writes a man from Wierda Park. In the past they just used to kick the door down. And, oh yes, we should have the right to keep fowls on our property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Angora Goat Stud Breeders write to Ramaphosa asking him to protect the rights of owners of animals. Animal-rights activists ask that animal rights be protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are political party submissions, submissions from pro-choice groups, women's groups, the Anglican church. There are letters from the gunowners' association, the paleantological society (who want citizens to have the freedom to appreciate South Africa's fossil heritage), from traditional healers, from Friends of the Pig, from the Chess Society, who want chess as a national game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are submissions on language. An Atteridgeville man does not want his mother tongue, Sepedi, referred to as Northern Sotho. He also wants a clause protecting nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man from Northcliff wants a constitutional right to pay back a mortage bond at a fixed interest rate. A young Claremont woman writes: &quot;My philosophy is that anarchy is the best way for a country to exist in harmony...&quot; People should have the right to do as they want to their bodies, be it drug ingestion or suicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many for the death penalty, and some who want castration for rapists and torture, mutilation and sterilisation for criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Form letters arrive, listing three points: pornography, homosexuality and abortion. &quot;While we support freedom of speech and the end of the oppressive apartheid standpoint in this area...,&quot; they all start. Carefully listing points under three headings, they ask for censorship, no gay marriages and no abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One woman from Rondebosch gets a little mixed up and beneath point two, on sexual orientation, she talks about pornography. &quot;Pornography insights (sic) men to rape. It is mainly imported from European countries, therefore many white women are seen in the movies. Will this not make a black woman feel she is not sexually attractive?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right to be sexually attractive, perhaps? Seriously, Haysom got on his desk, during the moments of early drafting last year, submissions from the ANC feminist lobby asking for clauses such as the right of women not to be harassed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are the cries from the heart: a 21- year-old who had an illegal abortion and nearly bled to death, an unmarried father who can't see his child, a mineworker from Carletonville on unfair dismissal. &quot;Thanks for this wonderful opportunity I never experienced,&quot; he writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did they count? At first, Cheadle chuckles. Then he says:&quot;A lot of work was put into analysing the stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My colleague, the poet Antjie Krog, says it was an exercise that focused people on human rights in a country where they'd been alien. Haysom says many have been incorporated into the Constitution, albeit not as concretely as the right to keep fowls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he warns, lobby groups are not necessarily &quot;the people&quot;. Democracy is about elected representatives drafting the Constitution, not listening to those who shout the loudest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are moments when it doesn't seem that the Constitutional Assembly will meet its deadline. Shortly before May 8, a Freedom Front member asks Ramaphosa for more time. &quot;The Inkatha Freedom Party (which walked out long before) may come back,&quot; he says. &quot;Perhaps we should wait for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you know something we don't know,&quot; says Ramaphosa, &quot;please share it with us. I assure you there is no one in this room who can't keep a secret.&quot; He looks around the room full of politicians, constitutional advisers and journalists, with a straight face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is part of Ramaphosa's inimitable chairing style, this deadpan humour that keeps the pace moving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ah yes. I was missing your chirpy voice, Ms Smuts, &quot; he tells the Democratic Party's Dene Smuts, who raises her hand after an uncharacteristic silence in what seems like the three-millionth discussion of the property clause. And enthusing over the right of freedom of residence, he says to his deputy, Leon Wessels: &quot;Just imagine. I can live anywhere I want ... Kakamas, Pofadder, Kareedouw ...&quot; Not so funny a mere decade ago in the days of pass laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the minutes got further away from midnight, the sensitivities heightened.  An ANC member once joked that his party could get anything through after 2am because they had more stamina than the National Party. The remark ended up in print, and after that the NP caucus advised its negotiators to try to wrap up talks by seven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the moment when everything is stuck around three clauses: property, the lock-out, and the right to single-medium education. The Nats want this, the ANC says mother-tongue education, yes, not single-medium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The irrepressible Cheadle slips a paper to the chair after yet another midnight bilateral. Ramaphosa announces a deal and starts to read: &quot;Any employer will have the right to lockout any worker for whatever reason, so long as that reason is not arbitrary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 8 of the property clause will go, he continues. Smuts cheers. It'll be replaced by a section that reads: &quot;Any land can be expropriated for any reason whatsoever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And anybody may have the right to single- medium instruction as long as the medium is Afrikaans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the real agreement is bartered, it looks for a moment as though the NP will swop its constituency for money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its negotiators agree to new words in the education clause allowing mother- tongue education in single-medium schools where practicable. But they ask for the pensions of politicians to be guaranteed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal meets with derision from the ANC minister Valli Moosa. &quot;What we are doing here is drafting a constitution. We did not think this was a document that would grant politicians privileges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a brief moment when everyone owns the new Constitution in the Constitutional Assembly - until the ANC members break off their victory song and start up an ANC chant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are the 48 hours in September, after the Constitutional Court sends the document back for reworking, when the Constitutional Assembly commissions Haysom, Cheadle and Wim Trengove, the assembly's advocate, to draft memos on the judgment. There is a moment when everything hangs in the balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Constitution is passed again, on October 11, Haysom looks for someone to go for a celebratory drink with and has trouble finding anyone.  Eventually he bumps into the ANC's Pravin Gordhan, who says he'd rather have coffee. &quot;It reflects that the real achievement in the minds of most was on the eighth of May,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bill of Rights, separation of powers, a president accountable to Parliament, independent monitoring institutions. A word here, a word there.  The big things and small.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you feel?&quot; I ask Cheadle. He laughs. I push. &quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot; perhaps there'll be a moment in the future when I'm bouncing my grandchildren on my knee and I'll be able to say: 'Hey! See this clause here ... I got that second word in'.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - FOUR Angolan refugees and the Human Rights Commission (HRC) have won a decisive legal victory over the Department of Home Affairs, forcing officials to explain why they accept some refugees as legitimate asylum-seekers, and reject others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until Tuesday this week, when an order was issued in the Cape Town Supreme Court forcing the department to be open about its workings, departmental officials had taken decisions about the legitimacy of refugees without having to explain their reasoning, or reveal what facts were influencing their judgments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, rejected asylum-seekers only had seven days to lodge appeals against these mystery decisions without knowing why their cases were faulty.  To add to their difficulties, the Appeal Board (which is literally one man, advocate John Leach, and his fax machine in &quot;Pretoria) has, according to sources, seldom overturned Home Affairs's decisions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees who have taken the government to task - Joao Pembele, Philippe Kutengala, Manzambi Fernando, Carlos Joaquim and Joao Mbala - in the first class action of its kind, have been coming up against Home Affairs's brick wall for some time. They all claim they fled persecution in Angola, but all have had their applications for political asylum rejected by the department's Standing Committee on Refugee Affairs, with no accompanying explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their tales of persecution vary, but they say they were caught up in MPLA- Unita clashes after Angola's 1992 elections. Mbala, for example, claimed to have been arrested by MPLA forces in 1993 and locked in a container in Lubango with 100 fellow BaKongo tribe members. He said only he and 15 others survived in the container, while the other 84 died around him in captivity.  After his release, he fled with his wife and new-born child to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like his fellow applicants, Mbala's application for political asylum was rejected and his only course of action was to leave the country or to challenge the government's lack of transparency in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees, represented by the Legal Resource Centre, chose the latter path and with the HRC forced the Department of Home Affairs to agree to a court order, making it compulsory for the department to give reasons for its decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They did this by serving an interdict on the ministers of Justice, Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs and on their directors general, asking for the Refugee Appeals Board to halt its operation. The subsequent court order will affect the fate of some 2000 refugees who have had their applications for asylum rejected and are waiting to appeal against the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorney representing the refugees, William Kerfoot, said: &quot;This is a really significant decision and &quot;I am delighted that refugees' rights can now be recognised and implemented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerfoot said that at times, the department's decisions appeared to based on incorrect premises and these errors could not be exposed because the officials refused to explain themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HRC's senior legal officer, Liesl Gerntholtz, said that the commission had decided to get involved because it had been swamped by complaints about Home Affairs from asylum-seekers and immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Refugees are one of our priorities because they are an important human rights issue which this country is going to have to deal with. We have had many complaints from people, ranging from how people are treated by Home Affairs to more serious ones where, for instance, people have been deported to Mozambique without having had a chance to put their case, and in instances when they are not necessarily Mozambican.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerntholtz quoted a case where they had been called to a prison outside Pretoria where Home Affairs was holding refugees in overcrowded cells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were mostly asylum-seekers from Zaire and the Congo and they were not allowed exercise, nor were they allowed to make telephone calls, not to family or to lawyers,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerntholtz said that they had been negotiating with Home Affairs on a range of human rights matters, but the issue of giving reasons for decisions on refugees had been central to talks with the director general, Piet Colyn. She said she was surprised that the department had agreed to the court order by consent, when it had been unable to commit itself to the practice of giving reasons in earlier talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocate Anton Katz, an adviser to the newly appointed commission investigating future migration and immigration policy, said: &quot;The process of determining refugee status satisfied the constitutional requirements of openness and transparency. Now asylum- seekers know why they are being rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the reasons the department gives we will get a clearer idea of what constitutes a refugee in the new South Africa and how the criteria set out by the United Nations are being interpreted by South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For 18 months, Leach's Appeal Board has been hearing appeals by persons who have absolutely no idea what they are appealing against. This court order makes the government accountable for its own decisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE Gauteng provincial government is to revamp its maternity services - a move which could lead to the closure of poorly supported units in Soweto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plans, to kick in next year, include attaching new maternity facilities to overloaded hospitals and, according to department sources, closing some of the 20 existing outlying maternity facilities, most of them in Soweto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospitals such as Johannesburg General are clogged up with basic maternity cases - its level of deliveries has nearly tripled in the past five years and women are routinely discharged just six hours after giving birth. But many of the township units are poorly used.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new units would handle most of the hospitals' maternity cases. Chief director of health programmes Dr Carol Marshall says the question of closing existing units has not been raised, though their status is being reviewed.  Other sources say closures are likely, but the province is reluctant to discuss them, given the opposition to the proposals to reshape general health services it unveiled in October. Such community health centres are also at the forefront of government's universal health care drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department figures show many of the clinics operate maternity services well below a level judged by the province to be economically viable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The units accounted for less than 20% of the deliveries the public sector handled in the past year. The clinics' average delivery rate in the past year was less than 99 a month, against a cost effective level of 100-150 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 18 secondary and tertiary hospitals, which are supposed to deal only with referred cases, are handling most deliveries - averaging more than 440 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Johannesburg General is being swamped by women who don't need that level of care,&quot; Marshall says. &quot;It's obvious that if you have overworked staff you don't have the same level of care.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CYRIL RAMAPHOSA has been caught in a potential wrangle between two provinces over a lucrative game park concession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyebrows have been raised over the outgoing African National Congress secretary general's presence at a braai where a 20- year extension of the concession was proposed to Northern Province officials - while Mpumalanga was making its own plans to &quot;commercialise&quot; the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramaphosa is a friend and business partner of MJ &quot;Bou&quot; Raath, who has a concession originally obtained from the Gazankulu homeland government to about a quarter of the Manyeleti Game Reserve. Raath operates two tourist camps in this part of the park. While Ramaphosa is not involved in this venture, he is a director of Akasia Road Surfacing, another of Raath's companies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manyeleti, a 23 000-hectare reserve which borders the Kruger National Park, presently belongs to the Northern Province, but has been earmarked for transfer to Mpumalanga in a series of border area swaps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mpumalanga Parks Board struck a deal with the Dubai-based Dolphin Group, reportedly more than two months ago, giving Dolphin development and commercial rights to four game parks - intended to include Manyeleti - for 50 years. The deal, worth hundreds of millions of rands, was shrouded in secrecy until it was announced a fortnight ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Dolphin and the Mpumalanga Parks Board were negotiating their deal, Raath organised a braai with Northern Province officials at his Khoka Moya Lodge in Manyeleti, at which Ramaphosa was present. Here, Raath proposed to the officials that they extend his concession - for which he already has a contractual option to extend until 2002 - for a further 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In return for the extension to 2022, Raath would have dropped a cumbersome &quot; compensation clause&quot; in his contract with the Northern Province, inherited from the original Gazankulu contract, which binds the provincial government to pay him the full value of any improvements to the tourist camps should the contract come to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The compensation clause put Raath in a particularly strong bargaining position - in fact, in about the last two years his company, Khoka Moya Wilderness Trails, has boosted the camps' value, spending more than R2- million on development costs. Should Raath's negotiations be successful, he would lose the right to that compensation, but he would stand to make a much more handsome windfall if his land concession to a quarter of Manyeleti were to be bought out when the park goes to Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga Parks Board chief Alan Grey this week said the Mpumalanga deal with Dolphin was conditional on the park actually being transferred to Mpumalanga. Should Dolphin then want rights to the entire Manyeleti, it would be up to them to come to an agreement with existing concessionaries like Raath. He said the length of term of Raath's concession would &quot;certainly&quot; affect the value of the right that Dolphin would buy from Raath, should they come to an agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Grey said he understood it had been agreed between Mpumalanga and Northern Province authorities that the Northern Province would, for now, sign no new leases or long-term extensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grey said he would have the matter raised at the next meeting of a joint management committee set up by the two provinces to co- ordinate an overall management strategy for the areas which may be affected by the border swaps. &quot; I would really feel concerned if they were to extend that lease until 2020,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern has been expressed to the Mail &amp; Guardian by people close to some of the role players that because of his political stature, Ramaphosa's presence at the braai could have put undue pressure on officials to accede to an extension of the concession. Said one: &quot;Cyril was being waved around like a flag.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both Raath and Ramaphosa this week denied Ramaphosa's presence had been anything more than &quot;social&quot;. Raath said he had been friends with Ramaphosa since &quot;two, three years ago&quot; and that he had been &quot;a very good friend of the company&quot;. Ramaphosa was appointed director of Akasia Road Surfacing (part of the Shoredits construction group) on June 1. &quot;It is completely untrue that we used him to intimidate people. It was purely a social occasion,&quot; said Raath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramaphosa said: &quot;My going there had nothing, nothing to do with influencing anybody in any way. I would never do that. It was purely social and coincidental ... I had gone to see the park - I love the wildlife - and there were some Northern Province officials there.&quot; Ramaphosa agreed his current position, with one foot in the business world and another in the world of politics, could give rise to similar charges. &quot;I suppose so, because in the end if it was a pure business proposition, this would not be the case. But I am not even connected to that (Raath's Manyeleti) business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greg Knill, chief director of environment affairs in the Northern Province Department of Agriculture, Land and Environment Affairs, this week said it had been confirmed to him that an extension of Raath's concession period had been raised at the braai, but that Raath was told he would have to make a formal submission. He said officials had been &quot;surprised&quot; at the approach, as &quot;we don't do business that way. Knowledge comes on paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knill said that to his department's knowledge there had been &quot;no further developments on paper&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THOKOZILE BASI described how she and another 200 labour tenants were evicted last week after the owner of the farm on which they were living near Weenen sold his property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our sons and daughters were working for the farmer and one day he told them to stay at home. Then another farmer came and said we must leave.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now here we are. We are starving. We are living in the rain and mud, and our houses are demolished,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the evicted labour tenants have moved into a mushrooming tent-town on the outskirts of Weenen. They said their families had been working on the farm &quot;for generations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are as old there as anything you could perceive in that place. We were there before the last farmer, and many farmers before him,&quot; said Sebezile Nene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some farmers in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands have argued that attacks against them have increased because &quot;we don't want to sell our farms&quot;. But Indituni Development Trust worker Rory Alcock says there is no direct link between the land hunger evident in the area and the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is terrible poverty here, but it's not often the people who are living under oppression on a particular farm who engage in violence,&quot; Alcock said. &quot;More often it's the people on the outside looking in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We spend a lot of effort working to prevent landless people from resorting to violence, but I think a lot of farmers create a lot of enemies over a number of issues,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evictees at Weenen's tent city, for instance, say they know nothing about the motives behind recent attacks in the area. What they do know is that farmer Piet Coetzee, with whom &quot;we have had no business&quot;, arrived with the bulldozer that flattened their homes last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coetzee's nickname is &quot;Piet Skiet&quot;, and the reasons for this are immediately clear. Standing barefoot at his gate in his khaki shirt and shorts, a khaki cap crowning his bearded face, Coetzee makes no attempt to conceal the wooden-handled revolver on his hip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anybody comes into my veld, I'll shoot them,&quot; he said, cupping his hands in a pistol-grip and making repetitive shooting noises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coetzee said he is only protecting his property after he fired his 17 &quot;farm workers&quot; for an illegal strike and absenteeism: &quot;They stole all my tools, the veggies, the sugar, the oil, everything, and now their cattle are grazing for free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tell them I'm going to come and push their huts down one day. They can tell (Land Affairs Minister Derek) Hanekom. I hope he'll come because I'd like to push him down with my bulldozer, too, along with all the others who've made promises they can't keep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coetzee's former workers live on the border of the tent city peppered with thornbush. An emaciated 50-year-old Thembi Ndlovu said he had stopped working due to illness, but rejected his former boss's version of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I know is that the people who were working wanted more money because they are getting very low wages of R80 per month and R50 per month. We are not farm workers. We are labour tenants who have been there long before he came. I'm the fourth generation of my family on that property,&quot; Ndlovu said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - EX-KOEVOET soldiers are patrolling the rugged terrain of Weenen after a spate of farm murders in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, say prominent farmers and police in this frontier town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Weenen Farmers' Association hired the guards after the son of local farming patriarch Philip Buys was gunned down two months ago by robbers allegedly hired by his business competitors, say locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buys's 41-year-old son, Philip (Jr), was shot dead in September by two men while others robbed the cash register of his store on the border of the human &quot;dumping ground&quot; known as Tugela Estates, outside Weenen. Buys's mechanic was wounded in the attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buys senior told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week his son's death was the last straw for local farmers who had buried several colleagues in recent years. &quot; At this stage, as farmers of Weenen, we are busy bringing in our own security.  We currently employ six Koevoet guards, and are looking at expanding security,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buys said the preferred option of four permanent security schemes under consideration in Weenen would comprise &quot;one European leader with five 'muntu' trackers and a vehicle&quot;. The former Koevoet soldiers are currently under the control of local commandos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Weenen unit is only one of several in action or under consideration by local farmers' groups, according to National Party provincial MP Rudi Redinger. The units are expected to include former security force members or private security companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redinger said the nearby Dalton Farmers' Association had held talks with private security firm Saracen, which he described as &quot;a leg of Executive Outcomes&quot;, with a view to contracting its members. He said Dalton farmers had &quot;basically decided we will have to protect ourselves, (but) there are still some farmers who are interested&quot; in hiring them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing militarism among members of the Natal Agricultural Union follows calls for the return of the death penalty and a state of emergency in the region to stamp out crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some farmers have recently attempted to shift the focus to crime across the racial divide, the issue is clearly racially divisive. Last month African National Congress MP Bheki Cele was censured by NP, Democratic Party and Inkatha Freedom Party members of the provincial safety and security committee he chairs for saying farmers were &quot;crying like babies&quot; over the death of their colleagues although they had not complained about the deaths of thousands of blacks in the province. Cele had been speaking in his party- political capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Weenen South African Police Service station commander, Inspector Johan Nortje, dismissed the perception that farmers were being specifically targeted in his area. &quot;Only one of the 17 murder victims in Weenen this year was a white man. Two of 17 attempted murders were white males and out of 21 armed robberies, maybe five were white victims. In my area, any person killed is a tragedy, but it's not specific to farmers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local land activist Patrick Masoga, a founder member of the Weenen Peace and Development Committee which successfully lobbied for Weenen's inclusion in the province's pilot land-reform programme, said it was &quot;a pity these farmers are only complaining about attacks on their members as if they are the only ones affected. In truth, both sides are affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need each other here. Farm work is basically the only work available, but the problem is many farmers don't want to see black farmers succeeding as their neighbours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to miss the continuing racial gulf in Weenen, however. The barbed wire protecting nearly every property in the town's main street highlights the siege mentality of many whites who feel they are under threat from black criminals, black farmworkers, black squatters and the black government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farmers like Buys trace their problems to the new South Africa. &quot;Farmers are dying because the law is not enforced anymore. There's no punishment, no death sentence and the jails have become free hotels. The whole thing was running smoothly and we prospered before everything went haywire with the new government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buys's grandfather was one of the first Afrikaner settlers in &quot;The Place of Weeping&quot; in the wake of Zulu King Shaka's attack on the followers of Piet Retief and, like most of the estimated 500 white farmers now living in Weenen, he is an old-style Afrikaner. &quot;Me and my black workers were happy, but now with these illegal occupations and stock theft, I've had to sell most of my cattle, and now I'm selling some of my land. They intimidate you until you want to sell,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nortje agreed the biggest crime problem in Weenen was stock theft, with 37 cases reported in the past three months: &quot;That's probably why the farmers hired Koevoet. They're good trackers,&quot; he said, adding the unit would work closely with the local police stock theft unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are signs, however, that the unit will play a greater role in policing than tracing stolen cows. Women in a mushrooming tent- town on the outskirts of Weenen said they were puzzled when the group which came to evict them from a farm last week comprised more than just the farmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a station commander, police and amasosha (soldiers), and they were armed with guns and a bulldozer,&quot; said Sebezile Nene. &quot;We don't know if they were the Koevoet soldiers, but they didn't speak any Zulu.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE National Party is not interested in recruiting African National Congress renegade Bantu Holomisa, says NP deputy secretary general David Malatsi, as he is on his way down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is not on our recruitment list,&quot; he told the Mail &amp; Guardian. &quot; Personally, I am suspicious of his staying in power because to be a successful politician you must have the stamina to stay there for as long as possible, and I think, in this case, it is more about demotion than a real belief in creating a new political party.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malatsi's comments are slighting in the light of Holomisa's gracious invitation to NP leaders to attend his &quot;consultative conference&quot; next year, with a particular mention of meeting Western Cape Premier Hernus Kriel to discuss politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kriel had earlier indicated that he wished to talk to Holomisa, but it is believed that he wanted to discuss taxi violence and not political formations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I doubt it was about recruitment but I would appreciate a meeting as I could tell him about my consultative conference and invite him along,&quot; Holomisa said hopefully this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa's invitation is ironic given that Holomisa and Kriel were at each other's throats three years ago during multi-party negotiations, when Kriel, as minister of law and order, ordered South African soldiers to conduct a cross-border raid into Transkei to attack so-called &quot;PAC terrorists&quot;. During the raid several sleeping children were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is likely that the NP and Holomisa will continue winking at each other from a safe political distance, because they both fall on the other side of the ANC fence and are actually gunning for the same political space, after 1999 - that of the official opposition. While their approaches are slightly different, they both claim to represent morality, in the face of ANC expediency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa's dream is for a party to germinate from his consultative conference, which will embrace all political affiliations, colours and classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We would invite farmers, right-wingers, progressive thinking minds ... we would write a manifesto. We would have to decide whether to go for local, provincial or national government in order to improve the declining standards of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most important thing to concentrate on are checks and balances to stop this arrogance of power displayed by certain individuals who believe their decisions are not to be questioned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Holomisa is championing the morality of clean government, he does not satisfy the NP's desire for a party based on a clear ideology of &quot;moral, Christian values and capitalism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malatsi indicated the the NP was still pursuing its dream of a mass movement based on values rather than skin colour. He confessed that there had been no movement on this dream since it was painted as a vision by NP leader FW de Klerk earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Justice and Freedom Alliance said in a statement that they had tried to court Holomisa, with the aim of starting a moderate party to oppose factions of the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While acknowledging failure, they poured scorn on the NP, and said they were the ones with the hot-line to God and black Christian voters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - EVICTIONS in the East Rand township of Thokoza are being hampered as people evicted earlier this week are returning to the houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No action has yet been taken against them, but there is a discernible tension in the township. The police and army are patrolling the area in strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some journalists were stoned on Wednesday but no one was hurt. Inkatha Freedom Party provincial leader Themba Khoza sent out messages on pagers falsely claiming that the police had killed residents and that bodies were lying in the streets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten of the 16 residents evicted by the police on Wednesday moved back to the houses the next morning. Meanwhile, the Alberton town council is continuing with further evictions in other areas of the township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFP leader in Thokoza, Sipho Sithole, demanded that the council immediately stop evicting residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tension in Thokoza is being exacerbated by former African National Congress-aligned Self-Defence Unit (SDU) members who are assisting the town council with the evictions, said an officer from the local police station who refused to be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the men who are evicting people are reservists who belonged to the SDUs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the IFP was unhappy about the reservists evicting residents because &quot;they favoured the ANC&quot;. Prior to the general elections in 1994, the SDUs were known to be aligned to the ANC, while the IFP was supported by the Self- Protection Units (SPUs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFP members - supported by former SPU members -clashed with police amid the continuing evictions in the township this week. Three people, including IFP youth league leader Thabani Dlamini, were arrested and charged with assault after a group of nearly 200 IFP supporters tried to stop the evictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alberton Town Council began on November 28 to evict residents staying illegally in houses. According to the council, more than 500 families are to be evicted. &quot;Those people forced the real owners out of their homes and have lived there since 1993,&quot; said council representative Themba Maluleka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They attacked the legal residents and forced them out of their homes, they should go back to where they came from,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maluleka said the former residents were presently staying in squatter camps outside the township and plans were in place to return them to their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;About 100 families have already been evicted. We would love to complete the evictions by Christmas, but the current problems we are experiencing means that will probably have to change,&quot; said Maluleka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiations regarding the illegal occupation of homes had been taking place for almost two years, he said. Evictions would definitely continue regardless of the negotiations with the IFP, which were still continuing up to early this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People evicted this week said they had no idea why the council was removing them from &quot;their homes&quot;. One said: &quot;This is basically a war against the IFP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have stayed here a long time and everything was peaceful, the police are only making people angry and more violence will occur,&quot; said Simons Shongwe, who was evicted this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was one of six residents at Dube Street told to vacate their houses. He said he did not know what to do with his belongings which were left in the front garden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shongwe said he moved into the house because nobody was living in it at the time: &quot;The house was empty, my family needed a place to stay. Nobody gave us any trouble until the police came here today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shongwe wants the government to provide him with another house. He said he would stay with neighbours or possibly build his own shack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFP this week threatened to destabilise the province of Gauteng. &quot;The ANC are using the police to get their revenge on us,&quot; said Sithole. &quot;The ANC accused the IFP of working with the police in 1992 and 1993, now they are using the police to enforce their authority&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They (the ANC) could not get rid of the Zulus in 1993 but now that they are in power they want to assassinate IFP leaders,&quot; Sithole said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFP had never denied that people occupied houses illegally, but believed the government's current action was &quot;outrageous&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - ATTEMPTS by Pan Africanist Congress members to ease the departure of its president, Clarence Makwetu, have been stymied by his insistence on contesting his position at the organisation's congress this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Makwetu has not been blamed entirely for weaknesses in the PAC, senior members believe his deficient leadership has contributed to the weaknesses of the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many had hoped rumours that he would be offered an ambassadorial position by President Nelson Mandela would bear fruit, and that he would leave the organisation in a &quot;dignified manner&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But like many African leaders, he probably believes he is a life president and he is refusing to back down gracefully,&quot; said a senior PAC member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a PAC convention in September, called as a crisis measure to chart a way forward for the organisation, eight criteria were drafted for the election of a new leadership. These include &quot;be dynamic&quot;, &quot;be vigilant&quot;, &quot;work harmoniously in a collective environment&quot; and &quot;inspire confidence within the PAC constituency&quot;. Many PAC members believe Makwetu falls short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Stanley Mogoba should be a shoo-in for the position, and the Methodist Church has already appointed the Rev Mvume Dandala as his successor as presiding bishop. Mogoba has retired from the church. Other contenders are PAC deputy president Motsoko Pheko and retired United Nations official Phillip Kgosana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mogoba was appointed by the PAC convention in September to initiate a &quot; healing process&quot; to reconcile party members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the convention was not a constituted gathering, its recommendations will be put to the PAC congress this weekend. Among them is a call to retain the ideology of Pan-Africanism by promoting African languages, and entrenching African values in the education system and through black economic empowerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The convention resolved that the PAC remain a liberation movement but have departments which reflect Cabinet portfolios. Political education among members should be stepped up and party schools established to train both rank- and-file and senior leaders about PAC policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* This weekend's congress is being held at the University of Venda in Thohoyandou.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - INKATHA Freedom Party leader Biva Nkwenyana appeared in court last month in connection with three separate murder cases - including one allegedly committed after his first court appearance - but he is still out on bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkwenyana's alleged accomplice in one of the murders, Vusi Zwane, was also released on bail but was re-arrested last week after injuring himself during an alleged armed robbery attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkwenyana and Zwane are two of dozens of violence suspects released on bail in KwaZulu-Natal every year. Their cases, however, demonstrate the gaps in the province's criminal justice system which allow political violence to continue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkwenyana received bail for the first time early last month after a KwaMsane magistrate recused himself from the case and it was referred to Empangeni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkwenyana is the IFP representative on the KwaMsane Community Policing Forum and crowds of his supporters arrived at court for his bail hearing, Natal Violence Monitor Mary de Haas said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was released on R3 000 bail in his first case, only to be rearrested at the court in connection with a separate case, for which the same magistrate immediately granted bail. A week later Nkwenyana was granted bail for a murder allegedly committed while he was out on bail for the first two cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkwenyana's lawyer announced in court that police members would be called to give evidence in support of his bail application. This allegedly included the KwaMsane police station commander Captain Dlamini, whose name appeared in the Transitional Executive Council report on hit squads in 1994, De Haas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These releases were authorised despite investigating officers and witnesses having testified about Nkwen-yana's danger to the community. &quot;The lives of witnesses, their families and properties have been placed in great danger,&quot; said De Haas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of this happened despite strong arguments against bail by (North Coast investigator Captain Mandlenkosi) Vilikazi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The magistrate says the case against them is not very strong, but at this stage if you are pursuing charges against them and they are a potential threat to the community, there is certainly enough reason to hold them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Haas said she had recently received information that potential witnesses in the cases could be targeted, and Nkwenyana has allegedly organised a march against a local trader believed to have played a role in his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Haas recounted the case in response to queries about rising tensions in the province in the run-up to the Christmas holidays. &quot;There is no sense sending out extra people once a year if you are not going to put the perpetrators behind bars and keep them there,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The entire bail and justice system needs serious attention. Generally speaking, the police don't argue strongly enough against bail. But in this case, a policeman who argued against it met a magistrate who ignored the legislation about tighter bail conditions. The Department of Justice is a danger to people's safety if it lets murder suspects out on bail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Network of Independent Monitors (NIM) South Coast representative Selvan Chetty said the failure of the courts to deny bail to suspects arrested in connection with last year's Shobashobane massacre was one of the main reasons for the resurgence of tensions in the area since June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Out of 128 political violence suspects arrested by Bushy Englebrecht's (special investigation) unit early this year, only five are still behind bars.  If people facing multiple murder charges are out on bail, the community won't want to talk about giving evidence,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Applications for amnesty from the the PAC and ANC are pouring in to the truth commission, and with a likely extension of the cut- off date right-wingers will also be able to apply, writes Eddie Koch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela is expected to cap a week of dramatic developments around the truth commission by announcing on Friday that people who took part in election bombings and other acts of violence during the run-up to his 1994 inauguration will now be able to apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting comes after announcements that former law and order minister Adriaan Vlok has finalised his amnesty application and that guerrillas from the African National Congress and Pan Africanist Congress's military wings are streaming in to ask for amnesty before the deadline on Saturday. It was also the week in which the first security force officer responsible for a serious massacre - Brian Mitchell - received amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcome of the summit at Mandela's office in the Union Buildings - due to be attended by Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen, truth commission deputy chairman Alex Boraine and Justice Minister Dullah Omar - will provide the pivot around which the commission will now begin to take more shape as an active agent for reconciliation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth body, in operation since January, has so far functioned mainly as a forum for victims to express the pain they have suffered as a result of human rights abuse in the apartheid period. The organisation has, until now, had only limited success in terms of its other major function: to flush out the truth from perpetrators in exchange for giving them amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the commission believe they will have time and opportunity to accomplish a more effective mood of reconciliation than the organisation has achieved so far if there is agreement to amend the truth laws so that more right-wingers can apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources inside the commission say the president will probably announce plans at a midday press conference that will enable right-wing terrorists who disrupted the country's first non-racial election with a violent car-bomb campaign to apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That move - along with the dramatic announcement this week that former minister Adriaan Vlok has applied for amnesty, and the decision this week to grant mass killer Brian Mitchell amnesty, is bound to bring the right-wing more into line with the principles of the country's new Constitution and its stress on the need for national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vlok was reported to have almost completed his amnesty application while a group of police generals and senior officers under the leadership of former commissioner, General Johan van der Merwe, will submit about 50 applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of that, the PAC announced this week that the entire high command of its guerrilla wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army (Apla), would apply for amnesty. An additional 600 applications from rank-and-file Apla cadres will be made before the deadline at midnight on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amendments to the truth laws, especially an extension of the period for which people involved in political violence can qualify for amnesty, will also benefit Apla guerrillas who carried out terror campaigns in the early part of 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC has also already handed in about 300 applications and is busy processing many more. The organisation has promised to make the names of each applicant public this week, but it is known the list will include Defence Minister Joe Modise, his deputy Ronnie Kasrils, and Rashid Abu Baker, former commander of the Umkhonto weSizwe's special operations unit, who is now a general in the SANDF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These late but dramatic moves will effectively shift the truth body firmly away from being a forum for public venting of anger and grief about past atrocities into becoming a more effective instrument for extracting the truth about these events - and then promoting forgiveness on the basis of the disclosures. A staffer told the M&amp;G there was a &quot;polling-booth&quot; atmosphere at the organisation's head office in Adderley Street, Cape Town as boxes filled with applications streamed in to meet the Saturday deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela is expected to tell journalists on Friday that his Cabinet will recommend to Parliament early next year that it amend its truth commission legislation in order to change the cut-off date for offences that qualify for amnesty from the end of 1993 to May 10 1994, the date of the presidential inauguration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deadline for amnesty applications to be handed in by midnight on Saturday December 14 is also likely to be shifted ahead by a few months to enable those who committed human rights abuse in the early months of 1994 to prepare their submissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In exchange for this concession, Mandela will probably ask Viljoen to encourage more support from his supporters to back the Constitution and the government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G has been informed that there is still considerable debate within the ANC about how the president should handle requests from a range of quarters to amend the amnesty rules. But the fact that Viljoen has been asked to attend the Friday summit indicates Mandela is likely to use the occasion to make one of those statesman-like gestures he has mastered. The timing would also bolster the mood of confidence that has been created by the passing of the new Constitution and would also accord with the spirit of the Christmas season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the decision to grant amnesty to Mitchell, a police captain sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role in the massacre of 11 people at Trust Feeds in KwaZulu Natal, has already prompted a flood of new applications for amnesty from perpetrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in the commission's investigative unit said more than 3 500 applications had been submitted late this week and the total was expected to reach 4 000 by the Saturday deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By far the biggest proportion of security force applicants were from the police with relatively few coming from the military. However a small group of former Military Intelligence agents were expected to apply and also a large group from 32 Battalion - the mercenary unit that fought in Angola and is reputed to have carried out train violence during the pre-election period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said staff were preparing to release a list naming all the organisation's members asking for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amnesty committee's decision about Mitchell was the first dealing with a security force officer guilty of a serious offence and, as such, has provided perpetrators and their legal teams with some clear guidelines about what kind of treatment they can expect from the panel of judges on the committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a conference in Stellenbosch last week on legal aspects of the truth commission, lawyers acting for former policemen and military officers expressed outrage that the amnesty committee had not provided clear guidelines for people who were thinking of applying but were still undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mitchell judgment does not refer specifically to the way it interpreted the principal of proportionality -that the crime committed should have been commensurate with the political motives of the perpetrator - but the fact that the police captain was indemnified and set free indicates the committee is willing to take a fairly liberal interpretation of the principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission chair Desmond Tutu said he had been surprised by the decision.  At the time the decision was announced he was preparing a reply to an Afrikaner group that had told him they did not believe former security force members would qualify for amnesty. &quot;This was a wonderful coincidence. It pulled the rug from under their feet,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling provides other guidelines: it notes Mitchell was under the command of the Joint Management Committee System that co- ordinated the National Party government's counter-offensive against the ANC in the 1980s; he considered it his duty to carry out the strategy; he had no personal motive in planning the massacre; and some of the constables who actually carried out the attack had already received indemnity under earlier legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this ruling was deliberately done to assist requests by legal representatives who were desperately needing more guidelines for the clients to consider while applying for amnesty,&quot; said Antjie Krog, a poet and journalist who specialises in the truth commission. &quot;I think the ruling has helped people who want to talk about the past by giving them some guidance through this slow process of amnesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP this week also bolstered amnesty procedures by issuing a statement urging its supporters who have committed crimes and violations of human rights to approach the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gradual alignment of right-wing parties, including the NP and the Freedom Front, with the objectives of the truth commission is likely to marginalise military figures like former defence minister Magnus Malan who have urged their supporters to risk being prosecuted in court rather than cooperate with the truth body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are, however, still some dissenting voices. &quot;This whole TRC has become a circus. The ruling about Brian Mitchell was a scheme in order to get people to come and apply for forgiveness,&quot; said Cyril Ramolo, an attorney acting for families of political activists who were murdered by agents of the state's death squads in the 1980s. &quot;But if people really want forgiveness they would go voluntarily. These people (perpetrators) are not willing. They are being pushed and manipulated into going.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Former Robben Island prisoners are bitter at not being consulted about its development, reports Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORMER Robben Island prisoners have slammed their leadership for excluding them from plans to transform the island into a monument celebrating the struggle against apartheid. They claim promises that they would benefit from the island's development have not been kept, and that senior positions on the project have been earmarked for white professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The island is to be developed as a world heritage site, national monument and museum, with the section where political prisoners were held to be converted into a Museum of the Freedom Struggle in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plans, approved by the Cabinet in September, include incorporating the University of the Western Cape's Mayibuye Centre into the project.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Correctional Services will hand over authority of the island on Wednesday to the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology. The plans follow work spearheaded by presidential advisor Ahmed Kathrada, who was instructed by the Cabinet in August 1995 to establish the Future of Robben Island Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His final proposal, drawn up after he had invited public submissions, says the &quot;special history of Robben Island will be taken into account during the planning and development process ... via the inclusion of ex-political prisoners ... through arrangements which can contribute to the socio-economic upliftment of ex-prisoners&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But former prisoners say they have been excluded from the process. None have been offered any of the 177 new jobs created by the redevelopment, which will include a chief director earning R26000 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western Cape co-ordinator of the Ex- Political Prisoners Committee, Zolile Ndindwa, said many former prisoners felt bitter and marginalised. The committee was formed in April 1995 to look after ex- prisoners' welfare and is chaired by Kathrada. Other committee members include Tokyo Sexwale, Terror Lekota and Jeff Radebe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were never involved in a representative capacity on the Future of Robben Island Committee. Now its proposals are being presented to us as a fait accompli,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prisoners did not make submissions to them, because many did not have the capacity to do so, and expected their organisation to call them together, hear their views and represent them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndindwa said he was contacted by Mayibuye Centre director Andre Odendaal last week to help find former prisoners to fill the new positions on Robben Island. He did not contact any, as he has not seen the final proposal for the island, and does not know what positions are available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Odendaal seems to be in a hurry, there seems to be a deadline. I don't know when it is. I haven't seen any advertisements for positions. All I know is ex-prisoners complain to me constantly, and I feel their pain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some are starving and very bitter, and their bitterness rubs off on me as well. They feel abandoned by their leaders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Robben Island inmate Zanile Mazantsan said he did not think there had been any meetings in the past year for ex-political prisoners to discuss the island's development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very hurt, even though I am employed and better off than most ex- political prisoners. Even unskilled ex-prisoners could have been involved in some small way,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazantsana said he had hoped to get involved marketing Robben Island memorabilia, and had brought together a group of ex-political prisoners to form a company. He is also involved in a consortium which is bidding for two radio licences for ex-political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But then I heard a business owned by whites has a contract to market memorabilia. Why were skilled ex-prisoners not given an opportunity to tender? Who agreed they should do it? There is absolutely no communication with ex-prisoners who toiled on Robben Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why are only white professionals being earmarked for positions in the Robben Island project? I know of at least three ex- prisoners who have MBAs and are fully capable of getting involved in some way or another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eventually ex-prisoners will not tolerate people who do not have their welfare at heart. It will be very interesting to find out who is involved finally in Robben Island, who is going to benefit financially. We will force them to step down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathrada said &quot;hurried decisions&quot; had to be taken to ensure continuity because the Department of Correctional Services was quitting the island by the end of the year. The positions were being filled as a temporary measure until permanent posts were advertised next year. &quot;In all fairness to ex- prisoners, I want to confess that I have not been in touch with them. But we have a list of their names now and steps are being taken to hold provincial meetings and report on our plans for the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Future of Robben Island Committee member and former Robben Island inmate Eddie Daniels said the committee had not met for some time as Kathrada was overseas, but he was confident it had the welfare of ex-prisoners at heart. &quot; There are a lot of people who believe Robben Island belongs to them. It doesn't, it belongs to the struggle. The people on Robben Island were only the black men who were caught,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What about the white men and women, the black women, the people in exile and those who weren't caught? Doesn't Robben Island belong to them as well?&quot; Daniels said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Ex-Prisoners Committee was supposed to deal with pensions, rather than representing ex-prisoners on the Robben Island Committee. &quot;Most of the people on the committee are premiers and cabinet members. How are they supposed to meet regularly?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela, probably the only leader of an industrialised nation who does not have access to potable water in his own home, has been brought in line with his presidential colleagues from other parts of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A R250 000 pipeline was this week being run into Mandela's traditional home at Qunu in the Eastern Cape so the president can spend Christmas there without having to use drinking water from drums that have to be bussed into the house from Umtata.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, just in case political opponents use this elementary service to claim that Mandela has hopped aboard the gravy train, the pipeline has been installed at no cost to the state. The Liberty Life Foundation provided the funds so that water from a current scheme to bring potable water to Qunu could be rushed along into Madiba's home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the president visits Qunu he has to wash and drink from 25 litre drums trucked about 100km from Umtata into the village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This extraordinary situation highlights the fact that the lack of potable water is one of the biggest problems faced by rural people in most parts of the country. Qunu villagers apparently face major health hazards because they are forced to drink from polluted springs and ground water supplies that often dry up in the winter months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry is not paying for the presidential pipeline, it does form part of a larger scheme to remedy the dire water situation in this part of the Eastern Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Water and Forestry Affairs Kader Asmal had already approved a major project to supply the entire village and 42 000 people living in the surrounding administrative area with water that is expected to be complete by August 1998. Some &quot;R1,5-million will be spent in the current year to bring the water scheme on stream -and the Liberty donation allowed the president to tap into this supply in advance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Pro Sano, the third-largest medical aid scheme in the country, has run up R90- million losses and now faces serious charges of bribery and corruption. Marion Edmunds and Mungo Soggot report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A TOP medical aid scheme for public servants is on the verge of collapse, racked by financial mismanagement and corruption allegedly involving leading insurance and consulting groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Papers filed in the Cape Town Supreme Court this week by the Department of Health claim Pro Sano Medical Aid has been allowed to run up losses of nearly R90-million while its ruling council took bribes from companies eager for its business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scheme, the country's third largest, provides medical cover to 70 000 members, most of them teachers, postal and municipal workers and staff at Telkom and Eskom.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The members contribute nearly R44-million a month into the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the health department's registrar of medical schemes claims the council has been operating an ambitious kickback network, involving high-profile groups including Metropolitan Life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department registrar Danibl Kolver says the Pro Sano council cannot be trusted to save the scheme amid &quot;wholesale and continuing irregularities which are seriously prejudicial to members&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kolver says the court must move quickly to put the scheme into judicial management, as compromising evidence could disappear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says prolonged uncertainty could herald the scheme's collapse, depriving its members of medical cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application is due to be heard in court on Friday, and Kolver is also calling for a commission of inquiry. Kolver sprang into action after presenting on November 15 a forensic report to the Council of Medical Aid Schemes. The chairman of the council is Justice David Melamet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The papers detail a string of allegations against the Pro Sano council, but Kolver says he does not want to vilify anybody by naming names. The council's current chairman Shuayb Patel, who took office in November, said his predecessor was Bernard Wentzel who resigned last month. In the previous year Lionel Kearns was chairman. The organisation's principal officer until last month was Dr Louis Kathan, whose predecessor was Solly Fourie. The current principal officer is Sidney Stadler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The papers say that in 1990 the council quietly set up its own company, Bon Sano, which has been used to ferry under-the-table payments to council members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bon Sano's illicit funtions included sponsoring council members' overseas travel and paying salaries to several key current and past employees of Pro Sano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bon Sano took on Pro-Sano's funeral policy for which it received R1,069- million a year. However, Kolver said: &quot;it is not apparent what services, if any, Bon Sano, is to perform in consideration of which it receives this very substantial income)&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kolver's list of irregular payments received by Pro Sano's council include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lR638 631 from consultant Willmore Spies, which company received commission and administration fees from one of Pro Sano's policies, the Admed insurance policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department's papers claim that Wentzel had demanded &quot;commission&quot; from Willmore Spies for the commission that Willmore Spies got from Pro Sano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willmore Spies, which received commissions totalling R4,4-million between 1991 and 1995, was sub-broker to consultant Alexander Forbes, which earned R4, 2-million. Willmore Spies also received unauthorised administraion fees worth R1,4-million, while Alexander Forbes bagged undisclosed administration fees worth R2,3-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l R10 000 from Metropolitan Life, which was used to fly two members of the management council to a conference in Boston in the United States this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within months of the payment, Pro Sano struck an in-principle agreement with Metropolitan Life that one of its subsidiaries would take over Pro Sano's administration from Medscheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* R6 000 from Quality Health Holdings for part of the expenses of the wives of the chairman and the principal officer to attend the same Boston conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A portion of the cost of university education for the son of the chairman of the management council was paid by Medscheme and Quality Health Holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kolver questions the relationship between Pro Sano and two Old Mutual employees who set up an investment company, Sterling Investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two employees earned commissions on investments they made for Pro Sano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kolver also questions Medscheme's administration and scolds top accountant Ernst &amp; Young for failing to blow the whistle on Pro Sano's doctored accounts for the year to December 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is necessary to establish why Ernst &amp; Young issued an unqualified audit report when it had earlier formed the view that the respondent was conducting business in insolvent circumstances and had reported it to the Public Accountants' and Auditors Board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the auditors' statement that Pro Sano was &quot;trading itself out of a deficit situation was at the very least misplaced optimism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patel told the Mail &amp;Guardian the council intended to fight the application.  He said the registrar had failed to note that there had been major changes in policy this year, adding that the scheme was on track for a surplus in 1996. &quot;There is lots of politics in all this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kolver points out that Pro Sano proceded to lose another R22-million from December 1995 until mid year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bad news for the members of the scheme is that, like all medical aid policy holders in South Africa, their premiums are expected to increase - possibly as much as 25% in a looming industry shake-up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - The text of remarks, as prepared for delivery by President Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea, to the Conference on Commercial and Investment Opportunities in Eritrea on December 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Let me begin by expressing my gratitude for the honor of addressing you today and express my thanks to those who worked hard to make this event possible. Thank you, Mr. Kassum and Mr.  Allison, for welcoming us with your kind introduction. I would also like to thank the Corporate Council on Africa for organizing this conference, the International Finance Corporation for sponsoring it, the U.S. Agency for International Development for financing our private sector representatives to participate in this event, and all the participants for taking the time to attend. Thank you all for your efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE ECONOMY AND GROWTH STRATEGY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the next 25 minutes or so, let me share with you my own views about the evolving business environment in Eritrea, and the investment opportunities emerging for the private sector and long-term foreign investors in our economy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial Condition: As you all may be aware, Eritrea is a young nation emerging from the ruins of decades of war and economic suppression. The liberation struggle left the country's infrastructure almost completely destroyed, its people scattered and its government and economic institutions very run down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growth Strategy Adopted: In spite of its poor initial conditions at liberation, Eritrea has emerged as a politically stable and economically promising nation in sub-Saharan Africa. Its economic and investment policies are moving in the direction of strong support for private domestic and foreign entrepreneurs and investors. Progress has been made in establishing a slim, forward-looking and corruption-free state bureaucracy. Efforts towards the establishment of a comprehensive legal framework and judiciary system are well under way. We in the government are very keen to establish a close partnership with private investors to find solutions to any remaining constraints to private sector development, foreign investment and economic recovery and growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eritrea has established cooperative relations with Ethiopia, and joined a number of regional and international trade and investment promoting agencies.  We have established diplomatic and commercial relations with many leading countries, including the United States and Canada. Eritrea has also signed agreements to promote stronger trade and investment partnerships with both bilateral and multilateral agencies. These initiatives will facilitate market expansion for Eritrean goods and services, and enhance Eritrea's attractiveness as a platform for producing goods and services for export to readily accessible foreign markets of more than 300 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To encourage the private sector to become the primary engine of economic growth and employment generation, we have adopted (i) a rational, simplified and competitive tax system; (ii) an open and liberal trade and investment regime; (iii) realistic market-based interest and exchange rates; (iv) an encouraging investment policy and efficient licensing procedure; and (v) sound and flexible labor regulations. Eritrea is also a crime-free and pleasant place to conduct business, and reasonably well connected to regional and international business centers through fast improving communications and transport facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic Achievement: Eritrea is blessed with good natural resources and a strategic location for establishing business operations which offer attractive investment opportunities for accelerated private sector development. More importantly, and complementing its natural advantages, Eritrea has a disciplined, motivated and hard-working people who are eager to be trained. Our economic reconstruction efforts have been successful in generating small- and medium-scale investments, and in improving the quality of the country's infrastructure. The overall reliability of the supply of power, transport and communications services has been restored and improved substantially in most parts of the economy. The management of public enterprises has improved drastically, resulting in full commercialization and an average capacity utilization that has increased to around 70 percent, compared to the low of 20-30 percent before liberation. Reversing the secular negative growth of the 1980s, Eritrea, during 1992-96, achieved an average GDP growth rate of over 5 percent per annum. The rate would have been higher had it not been for inadequate or erratic rainfall patterns which resulted in a poor harvest in three of the last four years. The average inflation rate during this period has been consistently below 10 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the expected positive impact of investments under way to improve water resources management, Eritrea can move toward even faster growth. To make this happen, we will continue encouraging private sector participation and foreign investment in all sectors of our economy, including private provision of infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADVANTAGES OF INVESTING IN ERITREA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Investment Policy Regime: Eritrea's investment rules are among the most liberal in Africa. There are no exchange controls for repatriating dividends and capital gains, and foreign investors are treated equally with local investors in securing access to land, utilities and other production inputs. While foreign investors are encouraged to train Eritreans, securing work permits for employing foreign workers with skills that cannot be readily available in the Eritrean labor market is not a problem. The overall tax rate structure is relatively competitive. Duties on imports of capital and intermediate goods, spare parts and raw materials are a low 2 percent; but an additional sales tax of 3 percent is also levied on imports of raw and intermediate materials. All imports for re-export are duty-free, and exports are exempted from sales and export taxes. Eritrea's investment policy provides guarantees against nationalization or confiscation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political Stability and Governance: During the last five years, we have laid the foundation for good governance and long-term political stability, free from corruption and bureaucratic malaise. A Constitutional Commission, composed of legal experts and representatives of the general public, completed a draft constitution for the state of Eritrea. Based on this draft, preparation of new commercial, civil and penal codes, and the procedures and court institutions needed to implement them is under way, with the objective of establishing an efficient and competent civil service accompanied by an independent and swift judiciary system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entrepreneurial Drive: Entrepreneurial creativity, inventive genius, manual skills and sense of duty are important requirements for succeeding in economic development, and all these attributes are very much in evidence in the Eritrean population. Eritrea has a long tradition of craftsmanship and entrepreneurship, which was stimulated by the new technologies in agriculture and industry introduced from Europe and elsewhere. These left a positive legacy in terms of inventiveness and creativity, which was put to good use during the armed struggle for liberation. This inventive genius and drive of the people can be used again in the peacetime reconstruction and development of our economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disciplined and Hard-Working Labor Force: We strongly believe that Eritrea's real asset is its people. In our development strategy, we gave top priority to accelerated human resource development. For well understood reasons, most Eritreans have little or no formal education, but they do learn new tasks quickly and have the dexterity to work with their hands. Finding competent and disciplined workers, therefore, is not a problem. The current labor law establishes regulations regarding minimum working conditions; employer and worker associations; procedures for collective bargaining and resolution of disputes; and powers and duties of the state in resolving labor disputes. Setting the minimum wage is left to market forces and employer- employee negotiations. Work permits for foreign workers are granted when a qualified Eritrean cannot be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAJOR INVESTMENT SECTORS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major sources of growth in the Eritrean economy consist of investments and productivity improvements in agriculture, fisheries, general manufacturing, and in services like finance, communication, transport and tourism. In addition, we have good long-term prospects for developing high- value mineral deposits (such as gold, silver and copper), hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas) and geothermal resources. The main sectors in which foreign investors can find long-term business opportunities are commercial agriculture, fisheries and fish processing, general manufacturing industries - - including privatization, energy and mining, and provision of construction, tourism, financial and a wide range of infrastructure services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture: This sector is the mainstay of the Eritrean economy (as a means of livelihood for the large majority of the population), but operates at very low levels of technology and productivity. The scope for increasing output with the application of relatively simple inputs and improved farming and water management practices is correspondingly large. Eritrea has significant water resources (seasonal rivers, underground water, etc.) that could be developed to establish irrigated agricultural estates for the production of high-value agricultural products; these resources are yet to be developed. Foreign investment can be especially promising in the production of fruits, vegetables, flowers and greenhouse plants, industrial crops, and livestock production, including dairy and meat (beef, mutton, pork and poultry).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fisheries: Eritrea's coastal waters are among the potentially most productive fishing grounds in the Red Sea. Thus, fishing offers attractive investment opportunities for the private sector, both local and foreign.  According to recent estimates, there is a potential for catching about 60,000 tons of demersal and 20,000 tons of pelagic fish per annum. The present fish catch of 6,000 tons could be increased 15 times without any risk to long-term fisheries sustainability. The most promising areas of investment for foreign investors in the sector are in canning tuna, sardines and anchovies; fish processing (salting, drying, smoking, filleting, etc.) and packing; fish meal manufacturing; establishment of cold storage and transport facilities; and fishing boat construction and maintenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manufacturing: Our country offers many opportunities for light manufacturing both for the domestic market and for regional exports. The context is continuously improving as we enhance our human capital and physical infrastructure. In addition, 39 of the 42 public manufacturing enterprises inherited from the previous regime are slated for privatization.  This divestiture program offers opportunities to acquire established enterprises which, with further investment in modernization and capacity expansion, could become competitive producers both in the regional market and for export to Europe and the Middle East. The privatization program is driven by our own strong conviction that commercial production of goods and services should be the domain of the private sector, and is expected to be completed by the end of 1997. There are no special conditions attached to buying any of the enterprises in the list, but expansion plans and export programs will be favorably considered in evaluating bids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mining Sector: We welcome foreign investment in the mining sector. A number of foreign and local investors are already investing in prospecting and exploration for precious minerals, with some seven exploration and six prospecting licenses having been issued. Among the most significant foreign companies involved are Western Mining Corporation of Australia and Ashanti Goldfields of Ghana. Other companies entering the sector are from the United States, Canada, South Africa and France. A mining license grants an exclusive right to the licensee to mine for specified minerals within the licensed area.  It can be transferred, assigned or encumbered, and inherited with the prior approval of the Licensing Authority. Mining companies have the right to freely dispose of their production either locally or in the international market. There is no restriction on the repatriation of profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil and Gas: Geological studies and preliminary exploration suggest good prospects for discovering significant hydrocarbon resources. We are actively encouraging private investment in the development of petroleum oil and natural gas resources. This sector is open to private participation, and foreign investors are invited to invest on the basis of internationally competitive production sharing contracts. The first exploration contract was signed with Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (USA) in 1995. To encourage private investors to invest, the state is prepared to enter into joint ventures with the private sector and to invest up to 20 percent of the equity capital in strategic oil and gas projects. Investment contracts offered in the sector are consistent with established industry norms, including production contracts running for up to 25 years with up to 10 years extension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hotels and Tourism: A principal attraction of Eritrea is its ancient and fascinating heritage as part of the historic Axumite Kingdom. Eritrea's offshore islands in the Red Sea and parts of the mainland along the coast have beautiful beaches. A glimpse at life under the waters of the Red Sea off the Eritrean coast opens up a veritable treasure chest of colorful corals.  Eritrean shores, positioned between two oceans and two distinct seas range from tropical to temperate and provide a fascinating spectacle of marine life and a treasure trove for scuba divers. Mainland Eritrea boasts spectacular mountain scenery dotted with interesting traditional villages. These features beckon the establishment of appropriate tourism facilities for an effective presentation to visitors and business travelers. They can form a solid basis for attractive business operations in special-interest tourism, ecotourism and safari tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banking and Finance: Private companies depend on an efficient financial sector for long-term loan and equity capital and for short-term working capital. Presently, with one commercial bank (which has 14 branches), one housing bank and one insurance company, Eritrea is underbanked. To alleviate the shortages of financial services, we are about to enact a &quot;Financial Institutions Act&quot; permitting the licensing of private financial institutions, including foreign banks. Eritrea also has good long-term prospects for establishing off-shore banking services and for becoming a competitive financial center in the region, given its proximity to the Arab Gulf, Africa and the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private Provision of Infrastructure: In addition to power, there are two critical infrastructure services that could benefit from increased private investment: transport and telecommunications. Existing trucking and bus services are mainly privately owned and further private investments in these subsectors are welcomed and encouraged. Port and airport facilities, as well as postal and telecommunications systems are state-owned but the government is investigating ways to involve the private sector in their operation.  Private and foreign investment is especially welcomed and encouraged for increasing the coverage and modernization of the country's telecommunications network. Our government accords priority to private and foreign investment in this sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power Generation: Eritrea is an energy-deficient country. About 82 percent of its total energy demand is met from fuel-wood and biomass resources.  Electricity, which is generated from imported diesel, meets only slightly over 1 percent of total demand. Installed power generation capacity in 1992 was under 50MW. Public investments now under implementation will bring power generation to 150MW by the end of 1997. Even with this increased capacity, however, a shortage of power is expected to continue though tariff rates are based on full cost recovery. To alleviate this problem, and to diversify the sources of supply, the government is encouraging private investment in geothermal and solar power, and foreign direct investment in these subsectors is welcomed and encouraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCLUSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conclusion, our country may not be perfect but we are striving to make it a dynamic port of call for the international investor. I want to wish each of you here a productive day and I hope to welcome you as partners and investors in Eritrea. I would again like to express my gratitude to the many people and organizations who have made it possible for us to meet here today.  Thank you for your attention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Following is the text of remarks as prepared for delivery by Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs George Moose at a December 10 commercial and investment conference on Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Isaias, ministers, distinguished guests. I am pleased to have been invited to participate in today's event. I am doubly pleased at the level of interest shown by the many businesses represented here. Your presence attests to the success of the efforts made by the government and people of Eritrea to build Eritrea's reputation as a privileged partner for commerce and investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to take this opportunity to outline U.S. policy toward the Greater Horn of Africa, describe U.S. efforts to contribute to the stability and growth of the area, and explain why we regard Eritrea as an important key to the region's future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE TROUBLED HISTORY OF THE HORN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Horn of Africa is struggling to free itself from the legacy of colonialism, Cold War conflict, and misrule. Some areas are well on the way to recovery, but others regrettably are still suffering. Much of the poverty and suffering that the region has known in recent decades can be attributed to the vagaries of an inhospitable climate, a fragile ecology, and recurring cycles of drought. But these natural calamities were greatly exacerbated by the incompetence and irresponsibility of repressive dictatorships, failed economic policies, and personal political ambitions that produced fratricidal warfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, if that were the whole story, I dare say none of us would be here today. For the demise of old, discredited regimes has given rise to the emergence of new ideas, and hope for a new generation. What is happening today in Eritrea illustrates what can be accomplished by the determined application of this new thinking. Moreover, the emergence of committed new leadership in the region has given the United States new and viable partners with whom to work in addressing the full range of shared regional and international concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The differing consequences of the last two major droughts to hit the Horn are instructive. The drought of 1984-85 caused almost unimaginable suffering.  Hundreds of thousands of lives were lost -- and television images broadcast around the world captured the enormity of the tragedy. The 1994 drought had the potential for being equally serious and devastating. Yet the feared disaster never came to pass, and the event went virtually unnoticed by the international press. Certainly, the international relief agencies played a part in the successful effort to avert a catastrophe. But far more important than any outside assistance was the existence of governmental leadership that took seriously its responsibilities for the welfare of their citizens. In stark contrast to the inept and oppressive authorities in place in 1984, this new generation of responsible and concerned leaders was able to mobilize the active support of their populations in order to make the most effective use of outside assistance, and to rely on a functioning market system that could compensate for scarcity and distribution problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. POLICY IN THE GREATER HORN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This evident connection between stability and success and the presence of responsible and performing governments is central to U.S. policy, in the Greater Horn and throughout the African continent. The complex transformations under way in the Greater Horn present us with both opportunities and challenges, which the United States is seeking to address in four interrelated dimensions of our policy toward the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- First, we support African efforts to establish democratic institutions and governments, to protect fundamental freedoms, and to institute the rule of law. Experience has demonstrated that these are also the essential requirements for genuine stability and national cohesiveness, as well as for sustainable economic growth and prosperity. Absent these basic conditions, ideas will not flourish, investors will not support promising economic sectors, and entrepreneurs will not take the risks necessary to create a dynamic, growing economy. That is why in 1996 alone, the U.S. provided $100 million to support democratization, human rights, and rule of law programs in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Second, the administration has made a commitment to assisting African leaders deal with root causes of crises and conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know that it is far less costly, in both human and monetary terms, to intervene early to prevent crises than it is to react to them. The large- scale instability that plagued the region of the Greater Horn over the past three decades prompted the international community to provide massive resources for humanitarian relief operations, resources which might have been more productively devoted to long-term development. Food aid to this region amounted to over $4,000 million between 1985 and 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crisis and conflict prevention are primary goals of the Greater Horn of Africa Initiative (GHAI), which was launched in 1994 with President Clinton's full backing. It also explains our continuing support for the development of the conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms of the Organization of African Unity, based in Addis Ababa. President Isaias has been a leader in the region in focusing on the need for regional solutions to problems of food security and conflict, issues of great importance to Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Third, and very closely related to the foregoing, we are convinced of the centrality of environmental issues. Environmental degradation, including soil erosion and deforestation, contributes to both poverty and political instability. And like other &quot;transnational&quot; issues -- international crime, narcotics trafficking, infectious diseases -- environmental issues do not respect national borders. They can only be addressed in partnership with other concerned and responsible governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an indication of our concern, Secretary Christopher has mandated the establishment of a worldwide network of &quot;environmental hubs&quot; in key regions around the world. I am pleased to say that the first environmental hub on the African continent will be established next summer in the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa, with responsibility for the entire region of the Greater Horn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Finally, we understand that it is free trade, free markets, and opportunities for the private sector that will build the economies of the region. The World Bank estimates that about 350 million new jobs will be needed in sub-Saharan Africa within a generation. Only the private sector -- free to allocate resources and respond to market signals -- can create jobs and income on this scale. Moreover, it is the private sector that can best provide Africa with much-needed access to investment, know-how, and technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is working to promote private investment in Africa through a variety of institutions, including the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Trade and Development Agency, the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and the Africa Growth Fund. We are looking to take full advantage of innovative new technologies to facilitate the dissemination of business information. An example is the Leland Initiative, which will help provide a number of African countries with high-speed access to the Internet. We are currently working to conclude such an agreement with the Eritrean government.  The administration also intends to take advantage of the renewed interest evidenced by the Congress in a more comprehensive and aggressive approach to promoting trade and investment in Africa, by putting forward new proposals designed to give special focus to those countries actively engaged in market reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VIABLE PARTNERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the policies that have guided the administration's approach to the Greater Horn over the past four years. We believe they provide a firm foundation on which to build over the next four years. But we also understand well that the best policies, however well conceived and vigorously pursued, will be foiled in the absence of viable and serious partners with whom we can work in pursuing common goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Happily, Eritrea is such a partner. It has also become a vital and integral part of a wider subregion that is undergoing a fundamental political transformation. Eritrea itself has emerged from its long struggle for independence to embark on an exciting program of political and economic rebirth. While that 30-year struggle left the country physically impoverished, it also forged a keen sense of national identity, unity, and purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighboring Ethiopia is also in full transition from a failed and disastrous military dictatorship to a modern democratic and open-market state.  Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania are seeking to consolidate their own political and economic gains and are in the process of recreating a framework for East African cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even as they look with justifiable satisfaction on the significant progress that has been made, regional leaders recognize that the status quo is not sufficient to ensure lasting stability and progress for the region.  President Isaias was one of the first leaders in the region, along with Prime Minister Meles of Ethiopia, to recognize that national stability and prosperity can only be secured through regional peace and economic cooperation. To that end, they took the lead in revitalizing IGAD, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. Through their commitment to IGAD, the states of the Greater Horn have created a forum where, despite their evident differences, they can continue to pursue a broad agenda of regional issues. The United States has welcomed and strongly supported this effort to develop regional solutions to shared political, economic, and environmental problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional leaders like President Isaias also know that sustained progress also requires an ongoing commitment to economic and political institution- building at home. Eritrea has embarked on an impressive effort to draft a constitution which will incorporate protections for fundamental human freedoms. The consolidation of the rule of law will help earn Eritrea a prominent place in the world community and will assure investors and business executives that they will be treated fairly. These protections will also give full scope to the enormous creative energies of the Eritrean people. We recognize the difficulty of pursuing comprehensive reforms so quickly. But we have high expectations for Eritrea, and few doubts about the country's ability to accomplish whatever it sets out to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eritrea's effort to draft a constitution through a process of dialogue with its people is matched by its effort to rebuild and reform its economy. It has launched an ambitious program to restore and improve the country's basic physical infrastructure -- roads, ports, railroads, power generation, and telecommunications -- much of which did not survive the struggle for independence. Equally important, it has embarked on a concerted effort to create a legal and regulatory framework -- including an attractive new investment code -- that is already beginning to empower the private sector to buoy the national economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are already seeing these efforts pay off. U.S. businesses have invested or committed $300 million in Eritrea, in various business sectors. This influx of capital, and the ties to the world trading economy it has brought with it, is a key factor in Eritrea's impressive growth over the last several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our embassy in Asmara has noted the country's commitment to developing its marine resources, including oil exploration led by Anadarko Petroleum; shipping and port facilities; tourism and recreation; and seafood processing and packaging. The government has also identified promising investment opportunities in salt, glass making, leather, and textiles. The road from the capital Asmara to the port city of Massawa is an impressive achievement of engineering, as is the ongoing work on a rail link between the two cities.  Both are indications of the high goals to which Eritrea aspires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who has traveled to Eritrea has experienced the country's dynamism firsthand. USAID Chief of Staff Dick McCall went there in March of this year to inaugurate the new USAID mission in Asmara. His visits to the countryside and extensive discussions with Eritrean officials confirmed his assessment of Eritrea's extraordinary potential for accelerated economic growth and development. The factor that most impressed him was the evident drive and dedication of its people and the vision of its leadership, which are surely the most important resources any country could hope for. That same impression was shared by the participants in the highly successful trade mission that the Corporate Council sponsored in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sum, Eritrea is undergoing impressive change. It is doing so by espousing the same principles that guide entrepreneurs and investors all around the world -- individual initiative and self-reliance. A quote from an article in the Financial Times earlier this year offers one of the best descriptions of what Eritrea represents: &quot;Eritrea is proud and principled, and virtually without peer in Africa as it pursues its own model of development and vision of democracy.&quot; We in the U.S. government offer to Eritrea and to those who seek to do business there our best efforts. And we extend to both our best wishes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Human Rights Watch and the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH) today called for the arrest of leaders who are suspected of having played major roles in the Rwandan genocide that killed more than half a million people two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the destruction of their strongholds in refugee camps in eastern Zaire, military, civilian and political leaders of the former Rwandan government are reported to be dispersing to Kinshasa (Zaire), to Brazzaville (Congo) and perhaps to other destinations. The two human rights organizations urged prompt action to arrest these persons before they go into hiding elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among these persons are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Augustin Bizimungu, a major general in the former Rwandan army (Forces Armes Rwandaises, FAR), who reportedly fled the defeat of his forces in eastern Zaire and now is believed to be in Kinshasa. Named chief of staff of the FAR ten days after the start of the genocide in 1994, Bizimungu commanded the army and the national police force that both participated in genocidal massacres and directed killings by civilian militia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Mathieu Ngirumpatse, president of the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development ( MRND), who is said to have fled from Kinshasa and to be in Brazzaville. He headed the MRND, party of the late President Juvenal Habyarimana, during the time when its militia, the Interahamwe, was trained and armed. The party organization as well as the militia led the campaign to exterminate the Tutsi minority and Hutu moderates. Ngirumpatse represented the MRND on the committee that installed the government that carried out the genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Theodore Sindikubwabo, president of Rwanda during the genocide, who was first reported to have been killed in the attack on Bukavu in November 1996, but who has more recently been reported in Kinshasa. During the week of April 17, 1994, Sindikubwabo incited the people of the southern part of Rwanda to &quot; get to work,&quot; meaning to kill Tutsi. He visited the commune of Nyakizu, where local groups were massacring Tutsi who had taken shelter in Cyahinda church, and reportedly encouraged the killers. In a famous speech in the town of Butare, he insisted that everyone must be involved in ridding Rwanda of the enemy. His government then removed the prefect (governor) of Butare, who was opposed to the slaughter, and widespread massacres followed immediately throughout the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Hassan Ngeze and Georges Ruggiu, two of the leading propagandists of the genocide, who are reported to be in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch and FIDH insist that authorities in Zaire, Kenya and the Congo detain these persons and hold them for investigation by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Given that they no longer benefit from the protection of the ex-FAR and militia, as they did in eastern Zaire, their detention can now be carried out without difficulty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch and FIDH also called on Cameroon to deliver to Tribunal authorities Col. Theoneste Bagosora, who is in their custody. Colonel Bagosora, chief of the administrative staff at the Ministry of Defense, effectively directed military operations at the start of the genocide and engineered the creation of the civilian government that administered the country throughout the period of slaughter. One of the first to distribute weapons to civilians, Col. Bagosora helped create the &quot;civilian self-defense&quot; units that killed Tutsi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two human rights organizations urged all governments to implement resolution 955 of the United Nations Security Council which called upon member states to assist the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in locating and apprehending former Rwandan authorities against whom there is credible evidence of involvement in the genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanzanian government, which has announced its intention to send home Rwandan refugees in its country by December 31, has reportedly proposed separating some 200 former authorities and militia members from other refugees in order to facilitate the repatriation. Among the 200 may be Jean- Baptiste Gatete, formerly burgomaster of Murambi, and Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, formerly burgomaster of Rusumo, both of whom have been identified by witnesses as leaders of massacres in their communes. Human Rights Watch and FIDH called on other governments to provide Tanzania with whatever assistance it might require to isolate the former authorities and to detain Gatete, Gacumbitsi and any others who are suspected of involvement in the genocide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The African National Congress, as part of its contribution to the truth and reconciliation process will be handing over a number of applications to the TRC's Amnesty Committee on Friday 13 December in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows the commitment made earlier this year at the TRC by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki on behalf of the organisation that ANC members in specific categories will apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In pursuance of this objective, the ANC had placed a number of newspaper advertisements including communication with former members of the organisation now with the South African Police Services (SAPS), South African National Defence Force (SANDF), the Intelligence community and other structures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, members have approached a number of centres including Non- Governmental Organisations (NGO), independent firm of attorneys, ANC offices at national, provincial, regional and branch levels for assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As at present TRC records indicate that a total of 300 applica- tions have already been submitted to the TRC by ANC members around the country, according to TRC Administrator Mandisa Dukumbana. Of these 100 were submitted on behalf of people serving prison sentences and the headquarters has so far received a further 60 applications and more are expected. These will also be handed in to the TRC on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Categories of applicants include former MK members who were based at home and abroad, MK field and camp commanders, members of our former security and intelligence department and ex-prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applications will be processed through the TRC, which will release the names if and when necessary. However among the applications which the ANC will submit are those of Joe Modise and Ronnie Kasrils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The enthusiasm demonstrated by all our members concerned is indicative of the commitment of our movement to help heal the nation of its wounds of the past and the entire Truth and Reconciliation process. In this regard, the national leadership of the ANC extends its heartfelt gratitude to members who have heeded the clarion call to apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees mobilized on Thursday emergency relief aid for up to 100,000 Rwandan and Burundi refugees reported to be sheltering in Zaire's Shabunda area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A seven-member mission is poised to proceed to Shabunda from Kinshasa over the weekend to coordinate urgent relief for these refugees- the first major group to be located since hundreds of thousands dispersed in eastern Zaire last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, the International Committee of the Red Cross identified up to 100,000 refugees in Shabunda, 175 kilometers west of the eastern Zairian town of Bukavu. Since then a UN mission, including UNHCR, has reported that while 10,000 of these refugees are in Shabunda town, the majority are in several pockets along the road farther east. Field reports indicate that many of the refugees are malnourished and are suffering from various diseases.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR is sending high-energy biscuits, blankets, plastic sheets, medical kits and water equipment from its warehouses in Entebbe, Uganda, for emergency airlift to Shabunda. The World Food Program is providing emergency food rations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief agencies, including ICRC, have already begun providing emergency assistance to the refugees in Shabunda town. The UNHCR team will look into the possibility of extending relief to the large concentrations of refugees outside the town. One major aim is to find ways of helping those who wish to return to Rwanda to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the first time we have located a significant number of refugees in the dense tropical forest of Zaire and we are doing everything we can to help them,&quot; High Commissioner Sadako Ogata said. However, she said the Shabunda operation would present major logistical challenges that would stretch the resources of humanitarian agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are hundreds of thousands of refugees who remain unaccounted for and we need to reach them. We need to provide them urgent relief and help them go back to their country. We need help from everyone to get to them,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR cared for some 1.2 million refugees in eastern Zaire before fighting broke in the region in October. An estimated 560,000 Rwandan refugees have returned to Rwanda since the middle of last month. Another 60,000 Burundi refugees have gone back to Burundi. UNHCR has received unconfirmed reports, mostly based on aerial reconnaissance, of large refugee concentrations in Zaire, but the group at Shabunda has been verified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR has had no contacts with large numbers of refugees since they began abandoning camps in eastern Zaire's Uvira region two months ago. Although the agency has reestablished a presence in the Goma and Bukavu regions, staff movements have been hampered by difficult terrain and continuing insecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large numbers of refugees have also been reported heading toward the interior of Zaire beyond north Kivu, making the task of reaching them in the dense forest and hills more difficult.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - Efforts continue to reintegrate the approximately 60,000 Burundian refugees who have returned from the camps in eastern Zaire. Even though the return of Burundian refugees from Zaire has slowed to a trickle, there are still tens of thousands of Burundian refugees in Tanzania. If they return home, this will put new demands on the already slim material resources of humanitarian organizations working in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations between Tanzania and Burundi remain extremely tense with both sides fearing the other may be preparing to launch an attack. Zaire too, has accused Burundi of aggression. Within Burundi, there are reports of new massacres in Kayanza Province. Meanwhile, the Buyoya government continues to argue that sanctions are aggravating existing tensions within the country, and is pushing hard for their removal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Buyoya achieved his first tangible victory December 3 in his long running efforts to have sanctions against his country removed. Central African leaders meeting for a summit in Brazzaville issued a communique calling for a lifting of sanctions, &quot;noting steps taken by the Burundian government towards re-establishing democracy.&quot; However, representatives of the Tanzanian and Kenyan governments, who are among two most ardent supports of sanctions, did not participate in the meeting. Burundi depends on access to port facilities in both countries for access to international markets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Congo summit, Buyoya argued that long-term peace in the Great Lakes would be impossible with Burundi's continued isolation. Burundian authorities have trumpeted the fact that he was invited as a head of state, adding that this amounts to recognition of the legitimacy of his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, the leading mediator in Burundi's civil war, has invited representatives of the Burundian government and Hutu rebel groups to attend peace talks in Arusha from December 12 to 14.  In announcing the meeting, Nyerere's office did not specify exactly who from the opposing sides had been invited to attend. Neither side has publicly committed to attending to the session, although in the past, CNDD leader Leonard Nyangoma and President Buyoya have both said they are open to the idea of talks providing certain conditions were met. Previously, Buyoya has emphasized that the CNDD must renounce &quot;its ideology of genocide.&quot; If the parties do show up, it will mark their first public meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Burundi announced November 29 that all citizens would be required to perform mandatory public service for the state. Although details of the program are still unclear, citizens will be required to work for a period yet to be specified. The work performed will be uncompensated but could be in any public sector, including the military. Citing the impact of the embargo and the on-going civil war, the government also announced that it was imposing a new tax that could be paid in cash or labor. The amount to be paid was dependant on each individual's resources, but government ministers are to take the lead by paying 25,000 Burundian Francs per month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International has reported that at least five prisoners from Muyinga prison &quot;disappeared&quot; shortly after they were taken from the prison by security forces on November 27 to be tried. The organization fears that they may have been extrajudicially executed. According to Amnesty, there are more than 6,500 civilians, including at least 2,600 accused of participating in massacres, held in various detention sites around the country. Many are held without formal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Tanzanian government pressing for a return of Rwandan refugees before the end of the year, there are concerns in Burundi that there might be a similar mass return of Burundian refugees from Tanzania. Tanzania hosts about 720,000 refugees of which some 190,000 are Burundians. UNHCR has looked at possible transit sites in Burundi in case the Burundian refugees eventually return, but has been reassured by the Tanzanian government that no pressure will be placed on Burundian refugees to leave Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision by the New York based Parliamentarians for Global Action to honor National Assembly Speaker Leonce Ngendakumana for his support of democracy in Burundi is being used by both sides of the conflict in Burundi to rally supporters to their cause. The Tutsi extremist youth group Sojedem has used the nomination to rally the support of their backers. The group is seen as being responsible by many observers for pressuring Burundian authorities to investigate allegations that Ngendakumana participated in massacres in Bujumbura Rural province in 1993. Ngendakumana has now complained to the New York body that the government's actions have put his life in danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unconfirmed reports indicate that between 400 and 600 people have been killed in the area south of Rukago and east of Musema in Kayanza province over the last week. The reports include allegations that the military, accompanied by civilians armed with sticks and other weapons, systematically burned houses and killed their inhabitants. There are confirmed reports that numerous villages were burned. The area is now reported to be virtually empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also reports of a December 3 massacre by unknown assailants in a Pentecostal church in Butaganzwa commune, Kayanza province. There were 107 people reported killed, but further details are still unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mines have become a potential threat to humanitarian and other vehicles operating in Burundi. Although there use is still relatively infrequent, they are no longer rare. On December 6, a military pick up travelling on a dirt road 10 km west of Muramvya hit an antitank mine killing nine soldiers. On November 17, an antitank mine destroyed a military truck in Ruyigi province.  These were the first mine incidents in either part of the country. In both attacks, the mines were placed on roads used primarily by military vehicles.  Although it is unclear who placed the mines, many observers suspect rebel forces who passed through both areas en route from their former bases in eastern Zaire to new camps in western Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politically motivated attacks appear to be increasingly mixed with acts of banditry. Several recent attacks in Cibitoke have involved the theft of large numbers of cattle. Since the outbreak of fighting in eastern Zaire in late October, Military authorities in the province report an increase in cross- border raids originating from both sides of the frontier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 30, armed persons of unknown origin attacked the Johnson Center, killing four and injuring three others. The Center in the Kamenge neighborhood of Bujumbura provides assistance to war-affected populations from the surrounding hills. On December 3, military authorities searched the center and claimed to have found a grenade and parts of a landmine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 11, 25 people were killed in a rebel attack on an IDP camp in Gihanga in Bubanza province. Ten of those killed were rebels killed by soldiers defending the camp, according to military sources. Hundreds of cattle were also reported stolen in the melee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one report, on the night of December 4, 23 of 35 prisoners held in Gashoho commune prison in Muyinga were killed by their guards. The report indicated that the prisoners were tightly packed into their cell and were demonstrating against the conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Affected Populations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reports that as of December 9, some 200 people were resident at the Gatumba transit center. Over the last two weeks, there have been virtually no new arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs operating in eastern Burundi report that some of the estimated 60,000 people who fled strife-torn communes in Ruyigi and Rutana provinces have returned. The affected communes are now reported to be largely calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MDM reports that since November 10, some 400 people have sought help at the health center which they support in Maramvya in Bubanza province. Most of those who have come to the center are women and children who have shown evidence of acute malnutrition. Many of these people were reportedly living in nearby forests out of fear that their villages would be attacked, or even as hostages of rebel forces. Aid workers fear that there may be thousands of others in the nearby bush without adequate food or water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers entered Uvira for the first time in over a month.  Representatives from DHA, WFP, UNHCR, UNICEF, ICRC and MSF participated in the December 4 mission which entered Uvira from Bukavu. The team, which was attempting to trace some 60,000 Burundian refugees from the area that are still unaccounted for, reported that life was returning to normal in the town.  Agencies have no immediate plans to set up permanent new offices in Uvira, and negotiations are continuing for the creation of an aid corridor from Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A WFP crop assessment mission in northern Kirundo has reported that lower than average rainfall in the region since October has limited crop production, particularly in Bugabira commune. The region, in which beans, rice, maize, and sorghum are produced, normally has a crop surplus. The mission estimated that some 30,000 families will be affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAO reports in its December 3 Burundi food and crop assessment that civil strife in Bubanza, Cibitoke and Karuzi has reduced crop production in those provinces by as much as 50 percent. However, favorable climactic conditions throughout the country has limited overall crop losses. FAO estimates that the 1996 second season food crop production to be about 1.63 million tons, a drop of some eight percent from the 1988-93 pre-crisis levels, and two percent lower than the previous year. Nevertheless, the impact of civil strife and the sanctions on internal transportation is expected to magnify the effect of the shortfall. Meanwhile, only ten percent of the fertilizers exempted from the sanctions two months ago have arrived from Kigoma. If the rest does not arrive immediately, the impact on the second agricultural season will be significant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.Humanitarian Coordination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DHA/HCU wishes to clarify that international humanitarian organizations in Burundi have asked that copies of requests from local organizations for non- food relief items be provided to the DHA/HCU unit. Local organizations should not submit their requests directly to the DHA/HCU unit, as was inferred in the November 27 sitrep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Regional Humanitarian Coordinator Sergio de Mello requested that the humanitarian community in Burundi prepare a joint position paper on recent developments in the country, and other issues that affect humanitarian operations, as well as recommended responses. Over the course of a week, UN and NGO agencies in Burundi produced a common document that was submitted to the Regional Humanitarian Coordinator on December 5, and discussed in his meeting with the Prime Minister on December 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO reports that it received 9 mt of medical goods December 4. The goods, which include vaccines and transfusion kits, are for use in rural health centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ngozi, MSF-Belgium is supporting 20 rural health centers. Two years ago, only half of the centers were functioning. An inter-agency mission visited several of the centers and found them to be well supplied and managed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Muyinga, IRC is working to improve local water and sanitation systems.  Through one project, IRC is putting together a water supply system for the hospital which would be independent from the city supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMC is also working in Muyinga to provide health care through public health centers and mobile clinics. The NGO has provided a surgeon and two surgical nurses on 24 hour call in Muyinga hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCF has now started operations in Muramvya with an office in Ijenda. The organization has provided health services in six of the nine working dispensaries in the southern part of the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Impact of Sanctions on Humanitarian Operations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the international spotlight has shifted to Zaire, humanitarian needs in Burundi continue to increase. With the return of tens of thousands of Burundian refugees from the former camps in eastern Zaire and reports of fresh fighting throughout the country, the rapid dispatch of large supplies of exempted humanitarian goods remains essential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though agencies have received permission from the RSCC to import the needed humanitarian goods, continued bureaucratic delays outside of Burundi are slowing the delivery of the needed items. WFP, for example, has received permission to import 2,545 mt of food per month to replenish its food stocks which are nearly exhausted. The agency has only sufficient cereal stocks to meet its needs through December 28. However, it still has not received permission to transport the food by barge from the port of Kigoma. Until permission is received, it must continue to use trucks which can only take small quantities at a time, and are in short supply due to the increasing transportation needs in Rwanda. To date, FAO has only received 400 mt of the 4,000 mt tons of fertilizer for non-cash crops which were exempted by the RSCC in September. Caritas Burundi, which has had medical and NFI stocks en route for Burundi delayed in Kigoma since July, is now considering transferring the stocks to another program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor of Ngozi has indicated that because of the embargo, his province has almost no basic school materials. UNICEF, as well as other organizations, continues to press for a sanctions exemption for educational materials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . GREAT LAKES - Complex Emergency Situation Report No. 12 Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, December 12, 1996. Note: The last situation report was dated December 10, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda people, who are Tutsi of Rwandan origin, settled in the Mulenge hills of South Kivu, Zaire, and the Masisi region of North Kivu, Zaire, more than 200 years ago. Sporadic ethnic violence in the Masisi region has occurred since 1959, but it again escalated in the fall of 1995 as the former Rwandan army (the ex-FAR) and the Rwandan Hutu militia (the Interahamwe) targeted Banyarwanda Tutsi in an apparent attempt to create an area of Hutu control. In September 1996, the situation in the Uvira region of South Kivu began to resemble that of the Masisi region, as government-sanctioned harassment of Banyamulenge Tutsis intensified. On October 8, 1996, the South Kivu Deputy Governor declared that Banyamulenge residents should leave the area within seven days or risk treatment as rebels.  On October 14, fighting broke out between the Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairian Army (FAZ) near Runingo refugee camp, in South Kivu, forcing the roughly 220000 refugees to flee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge joined forces with other Zairian rebels to form the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), and the fighting spread, moving up the eastern border of Zaire from Uvira to Bukavu, and south from Rutshuru (North Kivu) to Goma. As a result of shelling from Rwanda on October 26 and November 1, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kibumba, Katale, and Kahindo camps near Goma, fled to Mugunga camp. Both the ex-FAR and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)- financed Zairian Camp Security Contingent (CZSC), became involved in the fighting. After suffering defeat, the FAZ and CZSC retreated to the west, looting villages and displacing Zairians from Goma town and surrounding areas.  Following Hutu attacks from Mugunga camp on Goma town, the ADFL counter- attacked on November 14, forcing the ex-FAR and Interahamwe to retreat to the west and compelling hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected Rwandan refugees: An estimated 600,000 Rwandan refugees have returned from the Goma area camps to Rwanda. Most of the Rwandan refugees from the Bukavu and Uvira camps remain unaccounted for. Zambia reports 1,000 new Rwandan refugees, and Tanzania reports 1,200 new Rwandan refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian refugees: Of the 143,000 Burundian refugees originally in the Uvira area, some 62,000 refugees have returned to Burundi and about 13,500 have arrived in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newly Displaced: Fleeing continued fighting in Burundi, a new caseload of about 100,000 Burundian refugees has entered Tanzania. Approximately 35,000 Zairians have fled to Tanzania. About 475 Rwandan and Zairian Tutsis were airlifted from Brazzaville, Congo, to Kigali, Rwanda. Some 800 remain in the Congo and 11,500 Zairians are reported in Uganda. The U.S. Embassy in Zaire estimates that 170,000 Zairians have been displaced by the conflict in eastern Zaire, including 20,000 from Uvira, 60,000 from Bukavu, 40,000 from Goma, and 50,000 from rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unknown Populations: The U.S. military estimates there are 225,000 to 285, 000 people on the move within Zaire. UNHCR believes that there still may be as many as 400,000. It is uncertain whether these are displaced Zairians, Rwandan or Burundian refugees or former Rwandan militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to UNHCR, on December 7-8, some 23,000 Rwandan refugees from the Kagenyi and Rubwera camps in the Karagwe area of Tanzania dispersed to avoid repatriation. UNHCR located several groups of the refugees and persuaded about 4,000 to return to the camps for later repatriation. However, preliminary reports on December 12 indicate that up to 200,000 Rwandan refugees in Tanzania may be heading south and/or east -- away from the Rwandan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) traveled to the Shabunda region of eastern Zaire, 175 km west of Bukavu, on December 8.  They located between 8,000 - 10,000 Burundian and Rwandan refugees from the camps around Uvira in Shabunda town. Most of the refugees were reportedly in bad condition, suffering from diarrhea, malaria, and malnutrition. ICRC is providing protein biscuits and health assistance to the refugees. A United Nations (U.N.) mission on December 9 found three large concentrations of people along the road near Shabunda. A UNHCR team will assess the needs of these groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political/Military Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clashes continue in eastern Zaire, between ADFL and FAZ forces. The ADFL claims to have captured towns along a 550 mile front. According to U.N.  sources in Kinshasa, Kisangani has been calm over the past few days and newly- arrived Zairian Special Presidential Division troops reportedly control the town. Uvira, Bukavu, and Goma remain calm and under ADFL control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1080, the U.S. Government (USG) plans to participate in a multinational effort, led by Canada, to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the repatriation of refugees. The mission of the multinational force (MNF) is still under discussion. The 14-nation steering group overseeing the MNF will meet in New York on December 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donors and humanitarian agencies are providing relief and rehabilitation assistance to returnees in accordance with the Government of Rwanda (GOR) plan, agreed upon at a conference hosted by the Canadian International Development Agency in Geneva on November 23. Participants agreed to support the GOR in promoting reconciliation and dialogue and in meeting reintegration and development needs, including housing, justice, security, and human resources development. Participants also called on all parties involved in the conflict to allow full humanitarian access to refugees and displaced persons in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uvira: Access to Uvira town is now authorized and relief organizations report that markets have re- opened and are well-stocked, the nearby refugee camps are deserted, water treatment supplies and equipment are available and the health structure is largely intact. Access south and west of Uvira remains restricted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bukavu: Since mid-October, about 9,000 refugees have returned through the Bukavu-Cyangugu corridor. The number of arrivals from Bukavu has gone down from a peak of 600-700 daily during the week of December 2nd to less than 100 per day since December 7-8. Returnees pass through the Nyagatere transit center and several way stations upon crossing the border, and water, sanitation, and food distribution systems are well established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) officer traveled in the Bukavu area from December 4 -7, accompanied by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) medical coordinator, seconded from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The team traveled without escort from Bukavu to Katana camp, 41 km north, and noted three way stations, 10 km apart along the route.  Relief workers reported that only 21 refugees and two displaced persons had passed through the way stations during the previous four days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bukavu town, open air markets are operating with fish, cassava, potatoes, vegetables, maize, and soap available. However, two-thirds of the stores have been looted and have not yet re-opened. Bukavu's water plant currently has a 30 day supply of diesel and a 90-day supply of water treatment chemicals. ICRC has committed to rehabilitating the urban water system and ensuring that the hospital has access to a reliable water supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs reported that the week of December 2, ADFL required all NGOs wishing to continue work in the area to submit project assessments and proposals.  NGOs currently working in Bukavu include Concern International, Medecins Sans Frontieres/International (MSF/I), IRC, Save the Children Fund/UK (SCF/UK), Christian Aid, Oxfam, and Caritas. U.N agencies and ICRC are also working in Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goma: The following relief organizations are currently operating in Goma: American Refugee Committee (ARC), Merlin, Trocaire, SCF/UK, Concern International, Catholic Relief Services (CRS)/Caritas, Oxfam, MSF/I, ICRC, UNHCR, and the U.N. World Food Program (WFP). Small groups of Rwandan refugees continue to emerge from Virunga National Park in the Goma region. On December 10, 1,400 refugees from Virunga returned to Rwanda through Cyangugu.  UNHCR reports it has assisted in the repatriation of 35,000 refugees who have emerged from hiding in Virunga since November 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kisangani: Access to the internally displaced populations in this area is now hindered by insecurity. Aviation Sans Frontieres pulled out of the area after its aircraft came under fire on December 2 and ICRC has temporarily withdrawn staff from both Kisangani and Kindu. MSF/I plans to provide 40 metric tons (MT) of relief materials to displaced persons in Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda: Of the 600,000 estimated returnees, nearly 323,000 have registered in their home communes as of December 1, according to the U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR). UNHCR reports that most of the returnees are in good condition. Food distribution is ongoing in all prefectures of Rwanda. Distributions are implemented at the commune level with the exception of Mutara, Kibungo, Butare, Gikongoro, and Cyangugu where returnees receive assistance in transit centers at the prefecture level. From November 16 to December 6, WFP and NGO partners distributed approximately 6,170 MT, representing 1,600,000 weekly rations. WFP reports that all who returned with the large influx in mid-November have received their initial 7-day ration at the commune level and most are now receiving monthly rations. WFP plans food- for- work activities for the seasonal lean periods of December and March- April, for returnees as well as the local population. Emphasis will be placed on assisting women-headed families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HRFOR reports that while property disputes exist, most returnees have managed to find temporary accomodation with relatives, neighbors, or friends.  In some cases where returnees have found their houses occupied, the two parties have made informal arrangements to live together temporarily. The GOR has given squatters two weeks to vacate dwellings belonging to returnees and has set up temporary transit centers to house returnees and displaced residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HRFOR reported that the GOR has detained at least 162 returnees since November 15, some for their own protection. Of the 4,331 former soldiers who registered with the GOR, 12 have been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi: WFP food reserves in Burundi are depleting rapidly. Moving food by road from Isaka, Tanzania to Ngozi, WFP can import 1700 MT of food per month, leaving a shortfall of 800 MT. WFP has requested approval from the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee and the Tanzanian National Sanctions Committee to transport food across Lake Tanganyika which is more efficient and less expensive than road routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reports that of the 62,000 Burundian refugees who have returned to Burundi from Zaire, about 45,000 spontaneously repatriated to Cibitoke province and 15,000 arrived through the Gatumba transit center outside Bujumbura. WFP is distributing returnee packages to both populations.  The U.  N. Human Rights Field Operation in Burundi , UNHCR, and NGOs are monitoring returns to insecure areas. UNHCR reports that about 38,000 of the returnees to Cibitoke have settled in 10 government sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania: The U.S. Embassy in Tanzania reports that the refugee flow from Zaire and Burundi has slowed considerably, with some 500 - 1000 arriving daily and a total of 10,300 since December 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 5, the Government of Tanzania (GOT) announced a decision to close the Rwandan refugee camps by December 31. A joint statement issued by UNHCR and the GOT stated that conditions in Rwanda now allow for safe repatriation of Rwanda refugees. The GOR has given its commitment to receive all the Rwandan refugees and assumes responsibility for the repatriation. On December 9, UNHCR truck convoys carried 804 refugees from Tanzania back to Rwanda, and on December 10, 1,928 refugees returned by truck. From December 7- 8, 5,534 people have registered to return. However, movements of some Rwandan refugees out of the camps and further into Tanzania indicate that some refugees do not wish to return to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 5, two members of USAID/DART traveled to the Rwanda/Uganda border to assess available resources for a possible refugee return from Tanzania via Uganda or the Akagera National Park. UNHCR and ARC representatives told USAID/DART that due to poor roads and swampy terrain, refugees from the Karagwe camps are likely to travel south 120 km toward the Ngara camps and cross into Rwanda at Rusumo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief agencies are preparing for the return of an estimated 410,000 refugees via Rusumo. On December 4, the humanitarian community met in Kibungo, Rwanda, to coordinate relief efforts for refugees returning from Tanzania.  The GOR wants relief assistance along the Ngara-Kibungo corridor provided in a staggered manner so as to encourage refugees to keep moving rather than encamping at way stations. The GOR has suggested establishment of water points every 5 km, way stations every 10 km, health posts every 10-15 km, and biscuit distribution points every 20 km.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF/I and Swiss Disaster Relief will be responsible for epidemic control and ARC will operate two mobile health units from Rusumo to Kibungo. IRC and Oxfam will be responsible for water and sanitation needs from Rusumo to Kayonza, 92 km inside the border. ARC will handle all major relief efforts from Kayonza to Kigitumba, 100 km to the north. SCF/UK, ICRC, and Food for the Hungry (FHI) will be working on unaccompanied children issues. USAID/DART will be providing funds to NGOs assisting returnees.  Weekly food distributions began on December 9 in Tanzania camps, to ensure the returnees have adequate food during repatriation. WFP, assisted by NGOs, is pre- positioning food commodities in communes in Kibungo, Byumba, and Butare prefectures. Repatriation packages consisting of food and non-food items will be distributed at the commune level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 26, BHR/OFDA deployed a USAID/DART to Kigali, Rwanda, to conduct assessments, supply information updates, and provide funding to NGOs, U.N.  agencies, and international organizations for programs to assist with repatriation efforts.  On November 7, 1996, U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda, Robert Gribbin, declared a disaster, noting that the refugee crisis in eastern Zaire poses a humanitarian emergency for Rwanda. On November 12, U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson declared a disaster in Zaire, as a result of the violent break- up of refugee camps in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BHR/OFDA provided 675 rolls of plastic sheeting (sufficient to shelter 12, 000 families) and 13,300 blankets to UNHCR/Kigali. BHR/OFDA has also shipped 20 World Health Organization (WHO) emergency health kits which contain enough medical supplies to assist 200,000 people for three months to the Ministry of Health for distribution to health clinics in high impact communes. On November 18, the USG pledged $140 million in humanitarian and development assistance to address needs in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CDC has seconded staff to UNHCR/Rwanda, UNHCR/Tanzania, and to WHO in Kigali to provide epidemiologic and public health assistance to refugees and others displaced by the conflict in eastern Zaire. CDC staff also participate in short term assessments health performed by IRC and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RWANDA: USG FY 1997 Humanitarian Assistance (to date): BHR/OFDA, through the USAID/DART, is currently processing grants to 18 NGOs to provide shelter assistance, distribute relief commodities, support water and sanitation needs, provide health care, meet seeds and tools needs, and assist unaccompanied children inside Rwanda. In addition, BHR/OFDA is procuring communications equipment for the GOR and assisting UNDHA to collect and disseminate information. USAID/DART has authorized several NGOs to begin implementation of urgent relief programs and expenditures of over $20 million will be finalized by mid-December.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Some 300,000 refugees who left the Ngara camps to head further into Tanzania yesterday, did an about-turn today and began heading back. It was uncertain whether they were returning to their camps or continuing on to the Rwandan border, but it appeared they had been turned back by the Tanzanian military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later reports said the Tanzanian security forces were preventing the refugees from re-occupying some camps, in a bid to encourage them to continue to the Rwandan border. A tense standoff could develop, according to news reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exodus started yesterday afternoon with refugees telling aid workers they were heading for Kenya or Malawi. WFP said they had taken food rations with them and were &quot;obviously preparing for a long trek.&quot; Aid agencies also pointed out that the Ngara refugees had received food rations, and this could have sparked off the mass movement. Refugees in the Karagwe camps further north were due to receive their rations today, raising fears of another exodus. WFP said its food depot at Lumasi camp in Ngara had been looted and at Benaco camp, the largest in the area, WFP workers were refusing to distribute food until they were paid which had raised tension among refugees.  Relief organisations say the mass departure was triggered by a campaign of intimidation in the camps by Interahamwe and ex-FAR members. The Ngara camps house some 490,000 refugees, while the Karagwe camps' population is put at 110,000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanzanian military today set up a roadblock 4 kms southeast of Lumasi to try and stop the remaining 40,000-50,000 refugees from leaving the Ngara camps. WFP reported that these refugees did not put up any resistance and were returning to their camps. The Tanzanian authorities have warned for some time that refugees venturing 4kms from the camps will be arrested and repatriated. Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that UNHCR has been unable to move trucks from Rwanda into Tanzania. The Office of the Humanitarian Coordinator in Kigali reported that 30 trucks were supposed to cross over but were prevented from doing so at the last minute. Discussions are underway and it is hoped the trucks will be allowed over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan Vice-President Paul Kagame has warned that the threat to his country from Hutu militants is not over. Speaking in Kampala yesterday during a visit to Uganda, he acknowledged that the emptying of refugee camps in eastern Zaire had eased Rwanda's security problems but stressed that most Interahamwe and ex-FAR were still across the border. &quot;We have to keep watching out for any other eventuality,&quot; he said. According to AFP, Kagame also said Sudan was offering refuge to Zairean troops and Rwandan militias.  He added that his country was coping well with the return of refugees, although there were still some problems such as resettling them and finding food and medicine. Donor countries and organisations meeting in Kigali today and tomorrow under Canadian chairmanship will discuss the reintegration of returnees. UNHCR figures released yesterday showed that approximately 473,333 Rwandan returnees had been registered by the local authorities in their communes of origin during the month of November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by the UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) released on Wednesday made it clear the total number of prisoners in Rwanda's jails by the end of October came to 86,200. This represented an increase of about 2, 700 detainees since the previous month and an increase of over 23,200 since the beginning of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs with sources on the ground concur that there are some 25,000 displaced people and 50,000-60,000 refugees around Lobutu. In addition very large numbers of people are said to be on the road in groups between Walikale and Lobutu, which one aid agency said amounted to 50-100 people per kilometre.  The situation in Walikale is said to be calm. Aid planes are continuing to fly into the area. However Amisi airstrip which would be used for the purpose is reportedly in need of repair before the airlift can take place. UNHCR also announced it was mobilising emergency relief for up to 100,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees sheltering in the Shabunda region and a seven-member mission was expected to leave Kinshasa for Shabunda over the weekend. Field reports indicate that the refugees are malnourished and suffering from a variety of diseases. WFP and relief agencies are already providing emergency assistance to affected people in the area. AFP reported that the French foreign ministry's emergency unit sent a plane carrying 37 tonnes of relief supplies to Kisangani on Wednesday which is expected to benefit displaced Zaireans and refugees walking towards the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eastern Zaire rebel leader Laurent Kabila yesterday declared a unilateral ceasefire in the fighting with Zairean government troops and called for negotiations with Kinshasa. Announcing the ceasefire at his Goma headquarters, he made it clear the ceasefire was conditional. &quot;This (war) can continue if there is not a clear indication from the international community and the gang in power in Kinshasa to say they are willing to surrender or to start negotiations,&quot; he said. He added that the rebel ADFL alliance wanted to hold elections in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mission to check on eastern Zaire's mountain gorillas following fighting in the area has found that all the national park infrastructure has been destroyed and some park guards killed. A conservation group, International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP) said however that the gorillas - who live in the Virunga National Park which straddles the borders with Rwanda and Uganda - were not affected too much. The Zairean side of the border contains about 200 of the world's 300 mountain gorillas, which are only to be found in the Virunga area. IGCP said pressure on the natural resources of the park had fallen with the mass departure of Rwandan refugees, but poaching and rebel presence remained a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States said it was winding down its military presence in central Africa amid ebbing support for a multi-national force. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon noted yesterday that the &quot;momentum seems to be moving away from an international mission there.&quot;A Canadian-led steering group is due to meet at the UN in New York today to decide on the future of the MNF. Bacon said if the meeting decided against the MNF, the Pentagon would probably shrink the US operation to a dozen people or less. The European Parliament meanwhile urged EU heads of state and government to discuss the situation in eastern Zaire at their summit meeting in Dublin over the weekend &quot;in view of the current impasse.&quot;A resolution passed by the parliament stressed the need to deploy the MNF to allow the supply of humanitarian aid. However the UN special envoy Raymond Chretien yesterday questioned the need for the MNF, saying that the situation was &quot;encouraging.&quot; AFP said he told a news conference in New York after a five-week mission to the Great Lakes region that if present trends continued, there would be a diminishing need for the MNF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi peace talks began in Arusha today, but it was unclear who was attending. An adviser to Burundi mediator, former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, said yesterday that the talks would be held from Thursday to Saturday and that the Burundi government had agreed to send a delegation. The spokesman Charles Sanga also said a summit of regional leaders would be held in Nairobi on Monday which would focus on eastern Zaire. Burundi's mainly Tutsi opposition party Uprona and another Tutsi-dominated party Raddes have said they will not attend the Arusha talks, although the Hutu-dominated Frodebu party is sending its chairman Jean Minani and the outlawed Hutu rebel group National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD) has also sent representatives, although not its leader Leonard Nyangoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official report has accused Tanzania's former president Ali Hassan Mwinyi and several past and present cabinet ministers of corruption and abuse of public office. A presidential commission report, released on Tuesday by President Mkapa, said Mwinyi's office was responsible for allocating housing plots to his children and relatives in areas reserved for public institutions before he retired last year. Other ministers were accused of involvement in activities beyond their authority.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is the text of a statement on the situation in Eastern Zaire by spokesman Nicholas Burns on December 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States Government remains deeply concerned by the situation in eastern Zaire. While we welcome the return of more than 600,000 refugees to Rwanda, many others remain unaccounted for. We continue our efforts to identify groups in need in eastern Zaire, and to press all parties to permit access for humanitarian agencies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting in eastern Zaire not only contributes to the worsening humanitarian situation, but also poses a threat to peace throughout the Great Lakes region of Central Africa. Recent events have compounded a crisis that has been developing over a number of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1994 influx of more than one million refugees into the Kivu provinces of eastern Zaire further disrupted the delicate ethnic and political equilibrium previously existing in the area. Militia groups who fled with the refugees into Zaire launched incursions across the border into Rwanda and Burundi and attacks on minority populations in eastern Zaire, sometimes with the complicity of the Zairian armed forces. The United States strongly condemned these destabilizing acts of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to growing incidents of ethically-motivated harassment and attacks, some Zairian groups have recently resorted to armed rebellion to defend their security and press political demands, including their claims to Zairian citizenship. While we are sympathetic to some of these grievances, we nonetheless condemn the recourse to violence, just as we earlier condemned the use of violence by other militia groups in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the start of this crisis, we have urged neighboring governments not to join the conflict, and have pressed them to use their influence to restrain the rebel forces operating in the Kivus. When Rwandan troops entered Goma and Bukavu in October, and Ugandan troops crossed into North Kivu in November, we opposed these acts and urged immediate withdrawal of forces to avert escalation of the conflict. The United States strongly reaffirms its recognition of the territorial integrity of Zaire and the violability of the existing borders of all states in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We urge all parties to enter into negotiations to bring this crisis to a peaceful conclusion. As a first step, the United States supports efforts to begin a dialogue among Zaire and its neighbors. We applaud Kenyan President Moi's initiative in inviting regional leaders to a conference in Nairobi December 16. We hope this meeting will serve as a forum for launching negotiations to end the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also encourage early dialogue within Zaire to bring an end to the conflict. We hope this dialogue will also address nationality issues and other concerns of disaffected groups in order to ensure their full participation in democratic elections scheduled for 1997. The United States continues to believe that free and fair elections remain the best hope for addressing the legitimate political aspirations of all Zairian people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome - TANZANIA: Approximately 400,000 refugees from Kitali Hills, Lumasi, Benaco, Keza and Mushuhura have left the camps in Ngara and were reported on 12 and 13 December to be moving southeast from Ngara in what seemed to be an effort to avoid repatriation to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of these populations had received a two-week WFP food ration before they dispersed and are said to be carrying all of their possessions with them. However, as of the afternoon of 13 December, it has been reported that many refugees (numbers unknown) are now heading towards the border of Rwanda at Rusumo. Some refugees are also reported to have reentered the abandoned camps.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 80,000 Burundian refugees have remained in two camps in Ngara and are not on the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A WFP aerial survey conducted on 13 December found no refugees north west of Karagwe and none between Karagwe and Ngara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RWANDA:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP Rwanda is ready for the returnees from Tanzania with stocks of high- protein biscuits and food commodities ready for distribution. Seven way- stations have been set up and 200,000 biscuit rations are pre-positioned alongside 37 km of road between Rusumo and Curazo (Kibungo). The IFRC, RRC (Rwandan Red Cross) and World Vision, are responsible for the way stations.  WFP also has staff ready to receive the returnees throughout Kibungo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stocks in Kibungo prefecture have been built up over the last week in preparation for a possible returnee population of 340,000 persons from Tanzania to this prefecture. WFP stocks, as at 12 December, stand at 285,000 weekly rations in Kibungo prefecture with 167,000 weekly rations prepositioned in the communes where refugees are expected to return. A total of 1,200 mt of mixed food commodities are available in Kibungo and an additional 4,000 mt are available in Kigali, only two hours drive from Kibungo. 70 mt of high-protein biscuits are also in stock in Kibungo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pre-positioning of food stocks is also taking place in communes of Byumba and Umutara prefectures, both of which are also expected to receive a significant number of returnees from Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As at 11 December, in-country stocks designated for the returnee programme are 3,937 mt, equivalent to approximately 230,000 monthly rations or 980,000 weekly rations. The high-protein biscuit stock is at 372 mt in Rwanda as a whole, equivalent to 1,860,000 daily rations. The overall WFP stock level in Rwanda stands at 8,000 mt, which includes stocks for the returnee programme as well as for the projects which target local vulnerable populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 16 November to 12 December, WFP and NGO partners (CARE, CRS, LWF, World Vision, Concern, CRR, IFRC, Trocaire, Caritas, ADRA, MEC, GAA, AHA, World Relief, AEF, EEF, IRC, MSF, ASS, Salvation Army, Ingabo) distributed approximately 10,020 mt of food commodities (cereals, pulses and oil), representing 600,000 persons assisted with a monthly ration. In addition, more than 1,250,000 daily high-protein biscuit rations have been distributed.  All returnees are believed to have received at least a two-week ration with the majority having received a one-month ration. Registration of returnees in the communes continues, with around 70 per cent of the returnees counted so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1,403 Rwandan refugees returned from Goma on 12 December. 1,130 Rwandan refugees returned from Tanzania as well yesterday, bringing the total number who have returned from Tanzania to 5,200 this month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - The General Assembly this afternoon commended the efforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to resolve conflicts in Africa, as well as its work to strengthen its capacity in the fields of conflict resolution and prevention, by adopting, without a vote, a text on cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assembly also called for strengthening mechanisms for information exchange between the United Nations and the OAU in areas such as preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping operations, under the terms of the resolution, which was one of several acted upon without a vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, by the 28-operative-paragraph text, the Assembly invited the United Nations to support such OAU efforts as the development of an early- warning system and the coordination of information exchange between the United Nations and the OAU's respective early-warning systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By a text on cooperation between the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Assembly noted with satisfaction the completion of the Cooperation Agreement between the two organizations. The Secretary-General was invited to take measures, in consultation with the IOM Director-General, to ensure effective cooperation and liaison between the two organizations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adopting a resolution on assistance in mine clearance, the Assembly welcomed the support the United Nations had provided for the development of mine-clearance capacities in countries where mines threaten the safety, health and lives of the population. States and organizations were urged to cooperate with those efforts through the exchange of information and technology on mine clearance and to support scientific research on humanitarian mine-clearance methods and low-cost technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also this afternoon, the Assembly called on States, the donor community, and international organizations to provide assistance to five specific States or regions, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- In the Comoros, assistance was called for to help the Government in repairing damage caused by the act of aggression in 1995 when an army of international mercenaries invaded the Comoros and overthrew the President of the Republic;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- In Somalia, assistance was requested for, among others, efforts to rehabilitate basic social and economic services, as well as institution- building aimed at the restoration of civil administration at the local level in areas where security and stability prevail;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Assistance to Rwanda was requested to help reintegrate returning refugees, restore total peace, reconstruction and socio-economic development; support was also requested for rehabilitation in the areas of education, health, justice, security and public infrastructure; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Economic and social assistance for the Palestinian people was called for to assist with the development of the West Bank and Gaza, and the dispersement of assistance already pledged was urged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By another text, the Assembly urged the provision of financial, material and technical assistance needed to develop the capacity of the countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to reconstruct, rehabilitate and develop their economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, during the Assembly's review this afternoon of the situation in Afghanistan, the representative of Germany introduced a two-part draft resolution on international assistance for Afghanistan and the implication of the situation in that country on international peace and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statements during the discussion on Afghanistan were made by the representatives of the Russian Federation, Iran, Japan, Afghanistan, India, Ireland, United States, Egypt, Turkey and Pakistan. The observer for the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) also spoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The representatives of the Comoros, Djibouti, Congo, Rwanda and Ireland (for the European Union and associated States) spoke during the discussion of humanitarian assistance. The representative of Israel spoke in explanation of position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statements relating to the IOM were made by the representatives of Portugal, Pakistan, Philippines and the observer for that organization. On mine clearance, the representative of Ireland spoke and the representatives of China and Cuba spoke in explanation of position. The representative of Congo spoke in connection to cooperation with the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m. on Monday, 16 December, to take up the reports of its Sixth Committee (Legal), as well as reports of the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary), on the financing of United Nations peace-keeping operations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - African radio is switching from being a vehicle of the state to one of commercial enterprise. Peter van den Akker reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A TAXI driver called Antwi, in Ghana's capital Accra, roars with laughter. &quot; She is a sugar mammy herself!&quot; he exclaims, and to get his message across to his passengers, he points repeatedly to the radio set dangling underneath his dashboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antwi hardly plays music anymore on the cassette machine in his battered taxi cab. He tunes in to Joy Radio instead: Accra's newly established commercial radio station.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this trip, Joy Radio presented a talk-in programme where the listeners could participate in a debate on the moral implications of the sugar daddy and sugar mammy phenomenon in Ghana. And the phone-in woman who so dearly wanted to make a more subtle contribution amid those dripping of Victorian indignation was immediately exposed by Antwi as a sugar mammy herself. Antwi still chuckled when he raised the volume of his car radio for Michael Jackson's Black and White.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the early Nineties when the Ghanaian government decided to open up the airwaves for private initiatives in broadcasting, the commercial Joy Radio has been one of the first to jump into this new market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an estimated audience of three million people, Joy Radio's programming is as simple as it is effective. Take a huge dose of Western pop music, lard it with talk radio and commercials and your popularity is guaranteed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many more licence applicants in Ghana are still waiting in the wings - Joy radio has been one of the few successful applicants. The transformation of the media industry in Ghana makes it abundantly clear that the days of state- owned radio and television stations are over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More African governments are giving in to privatisation of the airwaves, albeit reluctantly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, it does not make too much sense for African governments, whether in a dictatorship or democracy, to have a stranglehold on the country's electronic media; especially when the advent of satellite has given anyone who can afford a &quot;saucer'', access to all the information of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politically, African rulers with an impressive record of coup d''tats, have also come to realise that controlling a national radio station no longer guarantees control of a country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the days of &quot;Please stay by your radios for further announcements&quot;, followed by the national anthem and martial music, are over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda is another example of a country which shed its fear of private initiatives in the domain of radio and television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowadays, Uganda's capital, Kampala, has no less than three commercial radio stations, fiercely involved in competition as all three cover the same urban area with an estimated audience of 1,5-million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fragmentation of Africa's airwaves is in full swing and nothing stands in its way. Listening to Capital Radio in Kampala is remarkably similar to picking up Joy Radio in Accra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capital's ingredients are exactly the same - Western pop music, a talk show and commercials. Programme director Hubb Gales explains: &quot;A commercial approach leaves little or no room for the elements of a public radio station.  Advertisements on a successful commercial radio station eat considerably into the available airtime and the radio station owners, although they want to see profits, do not want to immediately invest the profits in expensive programme production.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence the &quot;flat&quot; output of the fledgling commercial radio stations in Ghana and Uganda. And yet, listening to these programmes does ring a bell: South African community radio stations are also involved in establishing their own style and sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Ghana and Uganda where commercial viability is the guiding factor, community radio stations in South Africa have to manoeuvre between the Scylla and Charibdis of lofty Independent Broadcasting Authority rules and regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mushrooming of new radio stations freed from former state control will, in some way, contribute to new opportunities in mass communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's what I expect will happen,&quot; says Gales, who got involved with Capital Radio in Kampala when he toured Africa as music producer for the Dutch radio station VPRO. &quot;I am very interested in African music, the real authentic stuff, you know! But the people here are not really interested in their own music. What they do want to hear are Michael Jackson, Silk, Fugees and Boyz II Men - exclusively Western pop music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There is, however, still some room for popular music from Zaire, Kenya and South Africa. Yvonne Chaka Chaka and Brenda Fassie are very popular with our listeners here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have the doors swung open for a new brand of radio journalism on Joy Radio in Ghana, Capital FM, Sanyu and Buganda Radio in Uganda? In a way yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young and ambitious broadcasters, who only two years ago had no other option than joining the state-owned broadcasting houses (like the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation and Radio Uganda), are now flocking to the new commercial stations where they often find better salaries and more breathing space, which translates into spicy presentations and sometimes highly entertaining radio debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a firmly founded tradition of self- censorship has young broadcasters in Ghana and Uganda imbued with a great alacrity in dodging any issue which smells &quot;political&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is another factor which dampens the emergence of a new African journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Services like the BBC and Radio France International are in dire need of new &quot;channels&quot; for their international broadcasts. Their short-wave technology is a dying horse. So what is easier than selling your programme to local FM-stations on African soil. The BBC does so. Its Focus on Africa radio magazine can be heard on Joy Radio and on Capital FM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new wave in African radio is a steeple- chase. And countries like Ghana and Uganda seem to take the commercial hurdle without any problem. South African community radio stations, however, run a course with much more obstacles. It remains to be seen who will come out as the winner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Advertising has invaded the quiet confines of a local art gallery. Hazel Friedman notes the reactions to this transgression</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RADIO 702 always says it best with sound, right. Er not quite. These days it also says it with sight (and site). In a first for South Africa, it has placed one of its advertising billboards in a gallery.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emblazoned in white against a traditional black background, the billboard states: WHERE THE COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUS MEET. And it has not only heightened consciousness among traditional gallery-goers, but has raised conservative eyebrows as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The billboard forms part of the Hitch-hiker show on at the Generator Art Space in the Newtown Cultural Precinct. This is the first exhibition in South Africa to actively engage with mass communication technology by shoving the tools of the information trade into the gallery space. At the same time, it has transgressed the physical borders of arts, normally an insular galaxy, into the mass-culture of billboards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio 702 has served as more than a token guest of honour. In an authentic, inter- sensory cross-cultural exchange using the principle of audial arousal, the radio station collaborated with artist Joachim Schonfeldt to record familiar everyday sounds packaged in 10 to 15 second slots and played over the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Joachim told us he wanted to break the silence of the gallery and the almost religious reverence associated with art,&quot; explained Radio 702's marketing manager Jadi de Waal. &quot;Likewise, 702 had to shift its mindset from sound to visuals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She adds: &quot;We were briefed by Clive Kellner, the curator of the Hitch-hiker show, to produce a billboard as art in terms of a social statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our advertising slogans have always made people aware of important issues and radio is far and away South Africa's most effective communicator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The station's creative director, Shelley Hirsch, subsequently came up with a catch- phrase that would encapsulate 702's mission station and generate debate around traditional definitions of art and the extent to which the gallery context confers &quot;aesthetic&quot; status on to everyday objects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the presence of an advertising billboard in a gallery is unprecedented in South Africa, in the rest of the West the once sacrosanct boundaries between art and ad have long been blurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 1980s, for example, the work of Barbara Kruger, Victor Burgin and Jenny Holzer ensured that art became part of the urban landscape. Their truisms - advertising images and text such as PROTECT ME FROM WHAT I WANT and ABUSE OF POWER COMES AS NO SURPRISE - appeared on airport luggage carousels, on signs outside Caesar's Palace or at Times Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The images and medium might have mimicked slick examples of corporate advertising, but the message was unmistakeably a parody and critique of the stereotypes perpetuated by the mass media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995 South African artist Minette Vari produced a giant-size billboard and positioned it on a busy road just outside the Pretoria Art Museum. It consisted of a black and white image of the spread-legged artist whose features had been altered to a&quot;typically&quot; African shape with the aid of a computer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rumour has it that public response was measurable on the Richter Scale.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It's funny how some truly appalling greetings cards stick in your mind as a result of fiendish puns or brazen gimmicks. It's unlikely I'll quickly forget a card I received this week - via the Internet. I received an e-mail message notifying me of the card awaiting me on the web.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I called up the &quot;exclusive address&quot; contained in the message, and received the ultimate in multimedia messaging: not only a colourful card in obligatory red, green and Santa, but also a Yuletide tune looping incessantly from my PC speakers, and a stereogram which demanded I stare cross-eyed at a picture of hundreds of Santas until I could discern the 3-D message: &quot;Ho, ho, ho.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from the astonishing amount of human brainpower that had to go into getting across that vital message, someone hadn't done their homework very well, or else they might have sent me an alternative choice of interactive greeting card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the card was made possible by a company called Blue Mountain Arts (http: &nbsp;//www.bluemountain.com), which allows anyone to create a free interactive card for any of their friends in any number of categories, from Chanukah to Birthdays, from Get Well to Weddings. And, of course, Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's certainly an improvement on the Build- your-own-card site recommended last week, which turned out to be recycling the same cards it had on offer a year ago (Happy New Year for 1996, folks!).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alternatively, you could turn to the folk who brought us the Cool Site of the Day, InfiNet. Their e-mail cards at http://cards.infi.net/special.html include both Christmas and Chanukah (hurry - it ends on December 13) cards, and will shortly be offering cards for Kwanzaa (see last week's column).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the spirit of cross-cultural awareness, the online version of this week's column will spend a little more time looking at how Christmas is celebrated around the world, including sites in Denmark and Norway that claim their respective territories as the home of Santa Claus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in South Africa, we are the proud hosts of the Silent Night, Holy Night site (http://members.tripod.com/iago/index.html), where the carol of the same name is translated into about 20 languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jako Olivier of Sasolburg wants to collect all 230 translated versions to add to a selection that already includes Afrikaans, Sesotho, Indonesian and Ukrainian versions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His site also offers history and background on the carol, as well as links to other relevant sites on the web. The leading directory service Yahoo (http: &nbsp;//www.yahoo.com/) was impressed enough to name the site among its Picks of the Week last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SO now you want to say Merry Christmas in 33 languages as well? You can get that on the web too, but there's a catch. To find out more, visit the online version of this column at http://www.mg.co.za/ mg/pc/pcrevie1.htm</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Contenders for Gauteng's only medium wave licence are eagerly awaiting the IBA's decision, reports Jacquie Golding-Duffy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) faces a tough decision as the time draws near for it to award the single medium wave (MW) licence up for grabs in Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an IBA representative, the licence for Gauteng will be awarded - along with all the new Cape Town and Johannesburg FM and MW licences - before the end of February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contenders for the sought-after commercial MW licence are Punt op Mediumgolf, which will follow an Afrikaans talk radio format; World Sport Radio, which promises 24-hour sport coverage; and New Radio Consortium, which will provide news and information covering a range of topics including business, sport and politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Punt op Mediumgolf is backed by Boland Financial Services, which will have a shareholding of 30%, says consortium representative Andre Coetzee. The other shareholders include Gensec, which is Genbel Securities (30%); Henbase, a consortium of founding members and interested parties (20%); Mnyama, a group of 200 professionals from previously disadvantaged communities (10%); and Nozala, a black women-led empowerment grouping (10%).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two key women in the group are Nozala chair Salu Hlongwane and colleague Lerato Phalatse, director of programme co- ordination for the Gauteng provincial government. The women are integral to the consortium's pitch as they realise that the IBA is keen to see as many women as black partners being represented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that the black empowerment groupings are indicative of the listeners and will represent listeners' needs,&quot; says Coetzee. He adds that Punt op Mediumgolf &quot;will endeavour&quot; to make more shares available to Nozala once the radio station has proved to be a viable business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says listeners need to be empowered and since Afrikaans has been depoliticised, it is a much-sought after language medium as it is currently not used exclusively on any commercial radio station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we get the licence, it will be the first commercial radio station in another official language other than English. In Durban there are two applications for a Zulu-language- based radio station, which is also a move away from English being the sole official medium .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coetzee argues that advertisers penetrate their target markets much more effectively when advertising in a listener's home language. With Afrikaans being one of the 11 official languages, he argues that media planners are likely to be pleased at the opportunity to advertise in a niche market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The target market, according to the consortium's application, is &quot; Afrikaanses&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its written application, Punt op Mediumgolf states: &quot;Afrikaanses like to laugh. From the Afrikaner Yuppie in his BMW to the old boere-omie on his Deutz tractor. Humour is an integral part of the culture and language ... and they often laugh at themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radio station aims to be bold enough to tackle controversial issues and hopes to add a breath of fresh air for the new Afrikaans generation. Planned radio personalities include former mineral and energy affairs minister Pik Botha and well-known comedian Solly Philander. There will be very little music and much time devoted to discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Punt op Mediumgolf has also applied for an MW licence in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Sport Radio also boasts women representatives and several black empowerment partners. They propose to offer a &quot;unique format'' of live sporting events targeting sport fundis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lorne Maclaine of World Sport Radio says the consortium applying for the Gauteng MW licence consists of Moribo Investments, Gauteng Newspapers (a division of Independent Newspapers Limited), Anglovaal, World Sport Radio cc, the National Sports Council and the Communication Workers' Union (of which some members are IBA employees).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moribo Investments is the leisure and entertainment arm of Thebe Investment Corporation, and the backers of Moribo are mining house Anglovaal and Gauteng Newspapers, owner of The Star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backers of the sports council and communication union are Meseli and Nedventures. The former is a commercial bank attached to Thebe Investments, and Nedventures originates from banking facility Nedbank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maclain says the format of World Sport Radio will include live commentary and sports talk 24 hours a day with sport reports, results and interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be 30% live commentary and 70% sports talk. Listeners will have access to every major sporting event locally and internationally.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argues that niche radio is common in the United States, specifically sports radio, and it will also be in line with fashionable new stations mushrooming in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A survey of 400 listeners revealed that 80% would support a radio station dedicated to sports, while seven out of 10 advertising agencies displayed support, says Maclaine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The station, he says, is viable, with fewer than 150 000 listeners making it a low risk venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the IBA is objective, then I do believe they will make the right decision. The regulator has recommended we have disadvantaged groups and women represented and we have met its criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On our board of eight members, four are women. Also, the National Sports Council is not allowed to profit from the radio station and will therefore plough the money back into communities allowing for real empowerment to take place ... something the IBA wants,&quot; argues Maclaine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Radio Consortium (NRC), the third applicant for the MW licence - which includes M&amp;G Media, owner of the Mail &amp; Guardian - plans to call its station G-Talk. At present, no women are involved in the radio station, but NRC has set aside shares, currently in the name of G-Talk nominees, for female representation in its ownership structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other partners in the NRC include Kagiso Trust Investments, the financial arm of Kagiso Trust; Durban Videovision Enterprises, Anant Singh's multi- faceted company with its main focus on the production and distribution of feature films; and Publico Limited, a company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange for 10 years with a substantial interest in specialist publishing. Also involved in the consortium are leading local entertainer Johnny Clegg and Nedbank Investment Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its submission to the IBA, the NRC states that it hopes to fill a gap in the radio market with a product which is firmly Afrocentric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NRC adds that its station will provide &quot;tightly packaged news&quot; and information on a wide range of topics. It promises to be a fast-paced, progressive and energetic station, providing the &quot;sound of the metropolis - an urban area which is uniquely Africa and yet a multicultural melting pot''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consortium says it envisages a station that will make everyone &quot;feel good to be African&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The output of the station will be strongly local and the BBC Africa Service will be used as a news and current affairs source. The programming will be made up of a maximum of 25% Africa Service material and the rest will be local news with a distinct Gauteng flavour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consortium, in its written submission, says Afrikaans is catered for by Afrikaans Stereo and Radio Jacaranda and the white English market is catered for by SAfm and Radio 702. There is, therefore, a gap where black listeners are not catered for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talk radio is a very important and powerful format. It would be extraordinary if Gauteng, the engine-room of the entire sub- continent, did not have a talk station aimed at those who are fuelling that engine - the young, black go-getters who are shaping the new South Africa,&quot; says an NRC representative.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - When looking at the Audience Ratings (ARs) for all adults from November 25 until December 1, one will notice that certain local soap operas and dramas did exceptionally well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the South African Broadcasting Corporations (SABC) channel 1, in the top 10 programmes, the local drama Ityala Lamawele on Tuesdays brought in 14,6ARs, followed by the comedy Going Up, broadcast on Wednesdays, scoring 13,7 ARs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Generations had 12,5ARs, while The Bold and the Beautiful achieved 10,8ARs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Local is lekker and adult audiences are clearly voting with their remotes for our home-grown productions,&quot; said one media director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On SABC 2, Suburban Bliss was the highest scorer with 12,9ARs, and Homeland, on SABC3, had 8,1ARs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign production, Touched by an Angel, beat Homeland in the top 10 ratings for adults of all languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On M-Net, Egoli: Place of Gold remained a favourite among adult viewers, scoring 7,2 ARs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it came to children's favourites, Ityala Lamawele scored a phenomenal 21,8 ARs, followed by Going Up with 17,8ARs and Generations with 17,3ARs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suburban Bliss was also a firm favourite among children across all race groups, scoring 21,7ARs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On SABC3, children preferred Homeland to Touched by an Angel, scoring the production 8,9ARs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's interesting to see that Suburban Bliss had 18,5ARs among Nguni/Sotho speaking viewers, while among English/Afrikaans viewers it had 8,3ARs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Homeland, an English production, scored highest among Nguni/Sotho viewers with 11,6ARs while it never featured among the top 10 programmes for English/Afrikaans viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCann Erickson media planner Sue Parker says advertising agencies buy rating points and if local programmes are doing well, as they currently are, then clients are encouraged to buy advertising time around these productions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Especially among black audiences which are on the uptake, locally produced programmes are doing well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Suburban Bliss is an interesting example of a programme which is doing well among a cross-section of people. This is probably owing to its new South Africa political slant which attracts vernacular-speaking audiences as well as the loyal Afrikaans viewer. In this instance, a mass product can be sold around this programme as it reaches a diverse audience,&quot; says Parker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media directors are arguing that locally brewed programmes are adding a real South African flavour which audiences can identify with, allowing for a sense of loyalty to emerge as viewers vote with their remotes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&amp;G media editor Jacquie Golding-Duffy will take a fortnightly look at television ratings, alternating with Hunt Lascaris group media director Lyndall Campher's analysis of print media circulation</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Jacquie Golding-Duffy scrutinises the credentials of the newly appointed South African Broadcasting Corporation board members</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE appointment of members to the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board has been finalised, with President Nelson Mandela rubberstamping 16 of the 21 names submitted. But only five of the successful candidates seem to have specialist media experience, while the rest of the candidates, including the new chair, boast degrees ranging from medicine and social work to theology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new chair, Professor Paulus Zulu (55), has a diploma in Diagnostic Radiography, a masters degree in Social Science and a doctorate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Leader of the Freedom Front and member of Parliament, General CONSTAND VILJOEN is seen as John Wayne by his colleagues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which television programmes do you watch most often and why? I don't spend more than 10 minutes in front of the television set. I find the TV offensive to my people. Also, with so many different programmes I have to buy a TV guide before I can find the news for instance, and by the time I find out which channel it's on ... time has run out. Generally, I'm disappointed with the South African Broadcasting Corporation's TV and when I have enough money I am going to buy satellite.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which book have you recently read that you would recommend? When I read books they are technically oriented. I tend to read books on constitutional matters. Furthermore, I am Afrikaans-oriented and read mostly Afrikaans literature. Now with the Anglo-Boer War Centenary celebrations, I recommend that people read The Boer War by Thomas Pakenham. The author is not Afrikaans and gives an impartial account. Readers will be able to follow the celebration if they read this book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which radio stations do you listen to and why? Radio Pretoria and Radio Sonder Grense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you surf the World Wide Web of the Internet? Occasionally. We have the Internet on the PC at the Freedom Front offices, but I do not own one personally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is your favourite advertisement and why? Agricultural advertisements.  I am very interested in improved agricultural methods and equipment and prefer to look at adverts about agricultural auctions. I know all the auction adverts in Landbou Weekblad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which newspapers and magazines do you regularly read? I read the Sunday newspapers: Rapport and the Sunday Times. When in Cape Town I read Die Burger and the Cape Times. Magazines: I read Finansies &amp; Techniek and Financial Mail.  This is all I have time to read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you could be any film star or fictional character, who would you be and why? Viljoen's colleagues saw him as John Wayne because he is honest, walks tall and always shoots from the hip.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Robbing a bank these days can be as easy as opening your laptop.  That is what many banks worldwide are discovering and attempting to prevent.  David Gow and Richard Norton-Taylor report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CARLOS ARARIO, head trader at an Argentinian firm, Invest Capital, picked up the phone and called company director, Roberto Barbosa. &quot;You had better get down here,&quot; he said, &quot;we've been raided.&quot; Barbosa stared with horror and disbelief at his screen in his Buenos Aires office. Some $200 000 had disappeared from his firm's account with Citibank, one of the world's biggest banks, overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were very, very surprised when we opened the cash management account.  There were four wire transfers made out of that account without our authorisation and anonymously sent to four unknown destinations.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barbosa alerted Citibank executives at 111 Wall Street, New York. That was August 1994. For the rest of the year, Citibank's anxiety made its Argentine client's problems appear minor as its executives watched in panic while nearly 20 of their accounts - worth about $10 million - were plundered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citibank's marketing department proudly offers the transfer of funds in any currency straight into a client's account &quot;quickly, easily and cost- effectively&quot; as part of its &quot;wide range of international banking facilities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world's fifth-largest bank hastily assembled a &quot;war-room&quot; on Wall Street and from it watched impotently as its clients' money flowed quickly and easily, and at no cost, into accounts in California, Latin America, Finland, Israel, and the Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to United States court indictments, Citibank accounts held by Indonesia's Bank Artha Graha, Argentina's Banco del Sud, and Invest Capital SA, were raided, with tens of thousands of dollars assigned to accounts set up elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citibank began a global detective hunt as the bank realised it was in danger of acquiring a new image as victim of the world's first grand larceny via cyberspace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others who have hacked into computerised cash transfer systems were insiders. The hit on Citibank is presented in the US as an outside job. It may have been perpetrated by the Russian mafia exploiting the poverty and disenchantment of high-flying technocrats under post-Soviet capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the centre of a continuing Citibank-FBI investigation is Vladimir Levin, a 29-year- old Russian computer programmer and former biotechnology student from St Petersburg. He is accused by the US authorities of being the person who hacked into the bank's computers and carried out the attempted multi- million-dollar fraud from a laptop at the St Petersburg offices of AO Saturn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is a shabby software and accountancy firm run by a group of mathematicians and scientists who were losing out on the Croesus-like wealth enjoyed by the entrepreneurial Russian &quot;nomenklatura&quot; and criminal elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The salary at the Institute (St Petersburg's Technological Institute) I was receiving was very low and I was too ashamed to ask for money from my parents,&quot; says Levin. Computers, he says, were &quot;one of the symbols of perestroika. Unfortunately, since perestroika there was so little money being given to research and science a lot of scientists left Russia and went to other countries where money was more available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citibank's war-room traced an unauthorised money transfer - allegedly the result of Levin's hacking - to banks in Switzerland and St Petersburg. But the saga did not end there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evgueni Korolkov - a Russian who moved to the US for a better life - set up two Californian companies, Shore Co and Primorye. His wife, Ekaterina Korolkova, opened personal accounts at the San Francisco branches of the Sumitomo, Pacific Union, Great Western, and Wells Fargo banks as a conduit for cash from unauthorised Citibank transfers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 1994, Korolkova was arrested by FBI agents as she tried to withdraw stolen money from one of her accounts which, they had discovered, was the destination of some of the Argentinian money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She agreed to co-operate with the FBI, which persuaded her to enlist her husband, a former employee of AO Saturn, to help track down the perpetrators.  The FBI told him they would treat him and his wife leniently if he played ball and gave the name of the hacker. He pointed the finger at Levin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desperate to find hard evidence linking Levin to the crime, the FBI also contacted the Russian police. An official St Petersburg police video of what it claims to be the contents of AO Saturn's office shows computers, guns and Levin's passport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Russian mules - charged with picking up stolen money from foreign accounts - were arrested elsewhere as Citibank managed to recover a little over half the $10-million loss it initially feared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them was Vladimir Voronin, who was arrested in the Netherlands where he was about to collect $1-million from Rotterdam's ABN-Amro bank. &quot;It was not because I liked to do it, I had to do it,&quot; he says. He was extradited to the US where he pleaded guilty; in return he agreed to co-operate with the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A programme on British television's Channel 4 last week revealed that, about a year before the alleged Levin conspiracy was plotted, another hacker - known only as Megazoid - was the first Russian to break into Citibank's computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Megazoid, a mathematical wizard obsessed with computers, remains anonymous for fear of criminal gangs anxious to acquire his skills, which he claims enabled him to navigate the Citibank network undetected for months, penetrating secret files, using a computer and modem he bought for $10 and a bottle of vodka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he also claims to know the origin of the attempted $10-million scam.  Megazoid, it is alleged, did not work alone. One of his fellow hackers, a regular surfer on the Internet, got drunk and depressed one night - and sold the secrets of how to break into Citibank for $100 and two bottles of vodka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The buyers are said to be the mafia, which allegedly used AO Saturn and, claims Janet Reno, the US attorney general, in a formal extradition request, Vladimir Levin. On March 3 last year, Levin was arrested at an airport near London. Levin, who proclaims his innocence, has spent the past 21 months in a British prison, and is fighting against extradition to the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has told his lawyers, who are seeking his return to Russia: &quot;I have never committed any crimes and I do not wish to be sent to America, a country to which I have never been, where I have no home, no relatives, no friends and no money with which to defend myself. I consider my detention here in England to be both illegal and a breach of human rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The significance of the alleged conspiracy, with some of the players tried and convicted, some released, others on the run and yet more unknown, goes beyond the issue prompted by Megazoid's &quot;career&quot;. It highlights the vulnerability of financial institutions' computer systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike McKenna, former Citibank vice-president in charge of technology, talks openly of &quot;years of neglect&quot; during which the bank amassed 10 000 employees in technological services, 1 500 consultants, and, most tellingly of all, 3 400 subsidiaries in almost 100 countries. And, he relates, virtually each daughter-firm, certainly each country, had its own protocol for accessing the network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years ago there were 200 home-grown protocols, what he describes as &quot; an orchestra with many people with different violins playing different tunes&quot;, rather than a full-scale symphony in which strings, horns and percussion talk to each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank for International Settlements, Bank of England and the Bundesbank have recently issued warnings about the threat posed by electronic money and open-access computer networks like the Internet bulletin boards. There is even talk of &quot;off-planet&quot; banking - banks on Saturn and Jupiter reached by satellite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These transfers can take place from anywhere,&quot; Dietrich Snell, a New York attorney told one of the many US court hearings on the Levin case. &quot;You have the right user ID and the right password and the right computer equipment, the hardware, and as long as you know what you're doing on the computer, you can get into the system literally anywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Bill Marlow, a banking security consultant: &quot;Let's put it in perspective - the average bank robbery nets you $1 900, gets prosecuted 82% of the time and you could get shot. With a computer you see $250 000 and get prosecuted less than 2% of the time ... these figures are staggering. It's safer to go and buy a computer than a gun.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citibank said in a statement last week that it had lost less than $400 000 in the scam. &quot;No customers have lost any money,&quot; it said, adding that the accounts that were hacked into were not encoded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has installed an access control system, Des-cards, which uses passwords altered after each time they are used. &quot;Citibank,&quot; the statement said, &quot;is a leader in the financial services industry in fraud prevention.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Tic Tic Bang has shown that there is room for competition in the local music industry. Glynis O'Hara reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWO idealistic young men, who loved what South Africans might call alternatief (alternative) music, have proven that being big in the distribution business is not necessarily better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anybody who knows anything about the music industry will know that distribution is a crucial part of the mysterious process that makes an act a hit. After all, if the public can't easily find a CD or tape in the shops, it won't sell, will it?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tic Tic Bang, owned by Gary Herselman (39) and Mladen Pulijis (27), is a thriving business. But they don't see themselves as the guys who sell the &quot; weird&quot; music. Indeed, they really dislike that label, wanting to sell as widely as anyone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local music they distribute tends to be created by white artists, in English or Afrikaans, but that's not all they're interested in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their catalogue includes Sankomota's first album, Lesego and the Kalahari Surfer and Duncan Senyatso. They are open to any new township product. The Afrikaans music, naturally, outsells the English, there being a captive, enthusiastic market for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African English music has always had an uphill battle against American and British bands, and, in fact, local music quotas for broadcasting are in place to give a hand to this market, not &quot;ethnic&quot; music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tic Tic Bang's acts include Urban Creep, Koos Kombuis, Jennifer Ferguson, Robin Auld, The Sunshines and new boy on the block Henry Ate. They import CDs from 20 labels overseas, including Sterns, the African music specialists; and 4AD. And they've opened a commercial design division, to produce CD sleeves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gary and I both come from extensive retail experience (Pulijis was at Look &amp; Listen for four years and Herselman at Hillbrow Records for 12), so we know where the cracks in the pavement are,&quot; says Pulijis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also knew,&quot; adds Herselman, &quot;we could survive on selling lower amounts per title because we were such a small operation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither has any commercial training at all and they employ an outside firm of accountants to keep tabs on cash flow, debits and credits. They're reluctant to reveal figures, but say their turnover has doubled every year since they started. They now employ 10 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem with widening distribution,&quot; says Pulijis, &quot;is that you have to break the perception that South African music doesn't sell in mainstream places (such as CNA outlets or supermarkets). But there have been huge inroads this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There's been a lot of attention given to South African music, and I think record companies are putting more into domestic promotion owing to the bad exchange rate and the return of the majors (Sony, PolyGram, BMG) under their own names. They are investing in local recordings, on top of the domestic companies like Gallo, which has always been there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herselman agrees, but adds that there definitely are acts they've handled that another record company would not have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company now supplies to 100 independent stores and 100 Musica outlets around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CNA in KwaZulu-Natal phoned us up and said they wanted Urban Creep in their stores, whatever headquarters said, which was great. It's very difficult to get into the CNA. But this is progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tic Tic Bang is also known as the company for rave music, he says. Record companies should reinvest the money they make out of international dance compilations into promoting that market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Essentially we're in the market for breaking acts,&quot; says Herselman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are they putting their perceptions of quality above market forces? &quot;Look, we'd rather give quality, but we know we HAVE to sell as well - and that's where the sleepless nights come in! But we want the artists to be good and have long-term potential and not just die with the second album,&quot; says Herselman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They did run into a problem recently. &quot;We got hit very heavily with a customs delay. It was all part of an Asami (Association of the South African Music Industry) thing, they wanted every parcel checked. They were looking for piracy and apparently they did find quite a bit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But a sizeable part of our income comes from imports, and it affected us radically. We were delayed for weeks, and it's the kind of product that people want immediately, so we lost impulse-buying. But we will overcome it - we have three years of doubling turnover annually behind us, so we know we're on to a good thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The increased globalisation of the world economy is expected to have wide-ranging effects on both investors and consumers, Old Mutual International Asset Managers economic strategist Nigel Morgan said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefing journalists on his latest Market Focus, Morgan outlined why the kind of &quot;neo- liberal&quot; policies detested by Cosatu and others were needed in today's world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the worldwide move to more open economies and freer trade had made competitiveness the watchword as companies found themselves having to compete with imports on both quality and price.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This made the consumer more powerful than ever before and also served to lower inflation. But lower inflation had its pitfalls as well, Morgan warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people, he said, had been brought up in an era of high inflation and based certain fundamental decisions on that experience. For example, they might buy a house that costs slightly more than they could afford, expecting the kind of inflation-linked salary increases of the past to help pay for it in years to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lower inflation, however, meant salary increases were also lower and that a house could become a significant burden in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another drawback was that lower inflation plus competitiveness had also resulted in large-scale retrenchments as companies cut costs. They then often took back those same workers on a contract basis at lower wages, thus breaking the power of trade unions and putting an end to the concept of a life-long job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors would have to watch all this carefully, Morgan said. Because of the more competitive, cost-cutting approach, some companies would be forced to close while other would rise in their place. This process would be helped along by the consumer movement, which, &quot;being sceptical of the claims made for their products by the established corporations (had helped) the rapid spread of information on new products deemed to offer good value&quot;. Companies that failed the test would go under.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Low inflation and increased competitiveness also had implications for governments, Morgan said. &quot;In the inflationary period, huge debt burdens were not a problem,&quot; he said. &quot;Inflation eroded the real value of the debt at a rapid rate, and although interest rates tended higher for almost 40 years, they tended to be low relative to inflation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With low inflation, on the other hand, real interest rates were positive and large debt burdens were onerous. As a result, the emphasis was on cutting Budget deficits and debt and running up large current account surpluses, usually through increased exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, &quot;competitive devaluation has come to be seen as an attractive policy,&quot; Morgan said.&quot;Economic activity is focused on exports and investment, rather than consumer spending or government functions. This policy package has become the new orthodoxy, though populist resistance from groups losing power or privilege continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Repeatedly, however, even when a populist party wins power ... they are found to pursue an orthodox policy. In a competitive world, governments compete to be the most competitive.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - PX, Transnet's loss-making container shipment and consignment distribution unit, is on the road to recovery after the unions endorsed a restructuring plan, says Thabang Motsohi, deputy chief executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy, which involves closing 34 mini-depots, will see the company break even in the1998 financial year - after making a loss of R433-million this year and a projected loss of R295-million next.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motsohi said the proposal to cut costs and expand market share from 18% to 30% with 15 months had been endorsed by PX's five unions - the South African Railway and Harbours Workers Union, Technical Workers' Union, Salstaff Employees Union of South Africa, Black Trade Union of Transnet and the Transnet Allied Trade Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PX delivers 22-million parcels and generates an annual turnover of R550- million. But, says Motsohi, the company would now concentrate on a competitive, fast and guaranteed delivery service, as well as an exclusive service called PX Africa, to give it a clearer focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privatisation was not yet on the agenda, says Motsohi. &quot;The main purpose is to unlock the value in PX and optimise it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motsohi does admit that rationalisation could affect the workforce. Talks with the unions to minimise the effect of job losses will be concluded next month. The marginal depots employ about 560 of PX's 7 600 staff, but the closure would be offset by the opening of more agencies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Commentators believe Cosatu's latest document is out of step with the ANC and worldwide economic trends, writes Madeleine Wackernagel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE latest submission to the economic debate by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) - A Draft Programme for the Alliance - has been largely ignored by the business community, but not for very much longer.  Signs are that the first six months of next year will see confrontation developing on several fronts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document is interpreted by many as a last-ditch attempt on the part of the trade union movement to get back to the centre of policy-making. Instead of taking the debate further, however, one insider sees it as a major step backwards.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're back to the kinds of economic arguments that were popular five years ago. But the world has moved on since then and only Cosatu seems oblivious to the fact. It is ignoring the international picture. Globalisation means we cannot operate in a vacuum,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To talk of increasing this country's Budget deficit when every other country is doing its best to cut back on public spending is totally unrealistic. And Cosatu's attitude to the business community is off-beam, to say the least.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document proposes two types of interventions, covering state activities and private sector issues that require state regulation (see table). The former, including proposals for a national health service, would be impossible to fund, the latter impossible to implement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One cannot take such suggestions seriously. According to Cosatu, only business is to blame for the lack of jobs, inflation and high interest rates.  The fact that Anglo American announced a R30-billion investment programme this week, and that private sector investment has risen by about 35% in the past few years, immediately contradicts its claim that the private sector is not playing its part in developing our economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such talk can be dangerous, adds another analyst. &quot;So far the markets have not reacted to Cosatu's arguments, but should investors, local and international, start thinking that the African National Congress will take such arguments seriously, we could be in for a hard time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thankfully, the ANC is way ahead of Cosatu in developing sound, realistic economic policy and as long as all the arguing takes place behind the scenes, I cannot see it affecting the markets or investor sentiment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The irony is that the Cosatu document purports to have the same goals as the government, and indeed, business, in terms of economic growth, job creation, and redistribution of wealth. Its means of attaining them, though, are irreconcilable with those of government's macro-economic strategy, unveiled in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, insists a senior Cosatu strategist, the policy document will be taken seriously by the government. And while more work needs to be done to flesh out the economic programme put forward by Cosatu, the government's stand on economics is at the heart of the disquiet within the alliance, and as such, needs to be addressed, urgently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also maintains that it is not incompatible with the government's Growth, Employment and Redistribution (Gear) strategy, a view at odds with those of the business community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says one economist: &quot;These proposals are a difference of kind, not degree.  Cosatu is at the opposite end of the economic spectrum to the government, and one can't take the movement seriously. The issue of prescribed assets, for example, is completely unworkable and very detrimental to the (pensions) industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Possibly more important is the outcome of Cosatu's September Commission, due by April, which is investigating strategies to meet the economic challenges of the 21st century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody,&quot; says Tony Twine of Econometrix, &quot;is saving their ammunition for that. There seems to be some ambivalence in the alliance to Gear; only the economic generals are very enthusiastic. Then again, nobody is shooting it down either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next six months are crucial for the alliance, however, as the government fleshes out its policies on privatisation and exchange controls. &quot; We could see some conflict if the government sticks to its guns and ignores Cosatu's demands,&quot; says Nick Barnardt of BoE NatWest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On balance though, commentators do not see Cosatu's stand as presenting a serious threat to economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says the Old Mutual's Dave Mohr: &quot;It took a currency crisis to concentrate the minds of policy-makers earlier this year. As a result, the more moderate wing won the day. Now that the government has accepted the reality of a market-oriented economy, any kind of reversal would immediately impact on the markets, with knock-on effects throughout the economy. At most, I would expect Cosatu's influence to delay the key issues such as privatisation - it cannot reverse the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Many South African companies still appear to be awarding their executives increases way above the rate of inflation. Max Gebhardt reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH AFRICAN captains of industry have yet again rewarded themselves pay increases far above the rate of inflation. While calling on unions and employees to &quot;take the pain&quot; for the good of the economy, it appears they are unable to swallow their own advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wooltru board's earnings rose by 54,5% for the 1995/96 financial year, including share options cashed in. According to the company, however, straight salaries rose by 10%.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the retail group suffered a pretax loss of R55-million, which chairman Colin Hall blamed on strategic errors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not harmed shareholders' wealth, nor have we borrowed money to fund mistakes,&quot; Hall said after the release of the company's results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wooltru was not available for comment as Hall had gone on leave, according to a fellow director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the other big companies, Anglo American gave its executive directors a 25% raise, Anglovaal Holdings 24%, Anglovaal Industries 24%, Tiger Oats 14%, Sasol20%, South African Breweries 14%, and Pick 'n Pay 28%. (Non- executives were excluded from the informal survey by the Mail &amp; Guardian of the top 20 listed companies.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massive pay increases for senior executives are not only confined to South Africa. A recent report in Britain shows its senior executives received an average 27% pay rise, while non-executives have seen their pay boosted by 10%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salary increases awarded to South Africa's top executives in the year to end-July 1996 were the highest since 1992, according to human resource consultant FSA-Contact. General workers saw their pay increase by 9,9%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is estimated that senior executives in South Africa receive on average more than R700 000 per annum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there are the exceptions to the rule. Murray &amp; Roberts slashed its directors' salaries by R7-million to R3,3- million for the financial year 1995/96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Group chief executive of Murray &amp; Roberts Graham Hardy said the drop was the result of both a decrease in the number of directors on the board and a lower incentive remuneration - reflecting the decline in earnings after exceptional items by 8% to R375-million in the 1995/96 financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCarthy Retail also cut directors' salaries - by 1,8% to R4-million for 1995/96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet despite attempts made by the 1994 King Committee on Corporate Governance - which drew up a set of proposals on the disclosure of directors' remuneration similar to the Cadbury Report in Britain - it is still extremely difficult to quantify senior executives' salaries in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The King Committee recommended that the remuneration of executive and non- executive directors be separated, with a full breakdown of their earnings in total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A survey carried out by FSA-Contact of how remuneration of directors is tabled in companies' annual reports, in light of the King Committee's recommendations, discovered that 65% disclosed remuneration as a single global amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 5% said they gave a complete breakdown of total earnings of each board member, while 30% offered separate disclosure of executive and non-executive directors' earnings as global amounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The salary packages are also structured so that many directors receive non- cash benefits as well as cash benefits. Added to this are performance-related incentive schemes and management share options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Kris Crawford, remuneration executive at FSA-Contact, about 30% of the total remuneration received by senior management consists of non-cash fringe benefits - which don't have to be disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pick 'n Pay, for instance, only lists what was paid to directors of Pick 'n Pay Stores for services as directors and other managerial functions. The directors' stake in the holding company is given, but there is no further breakdown of their packages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglo splits executive directors' remuneration under subheadings: fees (R469 000), benefits and other emoluments (R20- million) and performance- related bonuses (R5-million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mervyn King, who chaired the King Committee, said it didn't believe there should be disclosure of individual directors' salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We decided this for two reasons - firstly it is personal and secondly we felt there was evidence that such a disclosure could lead to acts of kidnapping and blackmail if criminal elements knew what directors were earning,&quot; King said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is speculation though that disclosure of directors' remuneration might be the subject of future legislation - either included in planned revisions to the Companies Act or as part of the Open Democracy Bill, which is still in the process of being drafted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment, Britain has the most stringent rules on disclosure compared to its counterparts across the Channel. French companies aren't required to disclose directors' salaries, while German companies are only required to disclose a global figure for the entire board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Management consultants feel South Africa is slowly falling into line with international trends on disclosure. But as King pointed out, most South African shareholders are very apathetic about attending annual general meetings - where directors' remuneration packages are discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Anderson of Labour Research Services, a Cape-based consulting firm, feels South Africa is still in the backwoods internationally when it comes to disclosure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We certainly don't measure up to the United States or Britain on the breakdown in directors' salaries,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson believes there needs to be some measure to compare directors' salary increases with their performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congress of South Africa Trade Unions (Cosatu) feels that the private sector is not doing enough at present regarding executive salaries disclosure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you expect a worker who is earning below the breadline to understand the salary of a director, if you don't explain it to him?&quot; asks a union representative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mark Durr, Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) listing director, in terms of the JSE's listing requirements, companies reporting for the financial periods after June 30 this year will have to publish a statement explaining whether they comply with the King Report on Corporate Governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all this means is a simple note in the annual financial statement whether the company intends complying or not.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There are plenty of surprises at the top of the Premier League table with only Kaizer Chiefs representing the big names</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Castle Premiership kicked off last August, traditional giants Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates and Sundowns were expected to lead the chase for a record R500 000 first prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the national league moves towards the mid- season break, however, only Chiefs can look back with satisfaction at their results in the 18-club championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Amakhosi have collected 26 points after 10 rounds, four more than closest rivals Manning Rangers, a side emerging from shadows cast by better known Durban club Amazulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiefs, seeking their first championship title since 1992, have been particularly impressive in away fixtures with significant victories at Rangers and Bush Bucks already secured.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expensively assembled Sundowns are in mid- table, an appropriate postion for a team which has won four matches and lost four, scored nine goals and conceded nine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surprise of the early stages is the mediocre form of Pirates, the club who conquered Africa last year after lifting the 1994 South African title in a photo-finish with Cape Town Spurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pirates lie 13th having won only three of eight matches and while one remembers the famous Naas Botha line about the Currie Cup not being won in May, the Buccaneers may well have lost the Premiership by December. Deep down one senses that the men who wear the skull and crossbones relish the do-or- die nature of cup football more than the seemingly mundane chore of a league campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defending champions Spurs, the only club outside the 'big three' to win the blue riband of domestic football, are seventh, a creditable placing given that most of the league-winning team have moved on. Moroka Swallows and Amazulu, clubs desperately trying to rekindle the fires of former glory, are even worse off than Pirates with just two victories each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swallows recently hired former national coach Augusto Palacios, who played for Peru in the World Cup and has probably not been given sufficient credit for his role in the development of Bafana Bafana. Palacios quickly discovered the realities of life at the aviary, losing at home to QwaQwa Stars, although a draw at Chiefs last weekend suggests better times may be ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amazulu supporters believe they have a right to be among the elite and instead of encouraging a team which appears to be leaderless, they fling stones and storm dressingrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These actions will not do the nerves of coach Mike Makaab and his players any good, and are unlikely to bring about the dramatic revival the perpetrators so dearly want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the bottom, Witbank Aces are early favourites for relegation, a fate that will be even more painful from this season given the huge financial incentives on offer to Premiership clubs. Bloemfontein Celtic, a club apparently divided against themselves, are also in the relegation zone, their good results in the pre-season Coca-Cola Challenge a fast-fading memory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the trouble stems from clashes involving club boss Petros Molemela, known as White Head and one of those larger-than-life personalties essential for the health of a sport. Unfortunately, Molemela often confuses his duties with those of his coach, leading to the loss of Stanley Phiri, Palacios and Walter Rautmann in rapid succession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A surprising feature of the new league has been the number of away victories, 31 against 33 home wins and 23 draws with Chiefs and Rangers boasting 100% records on the road. Goals have not flowed freely, though, with 170 in 87 matches giving an average of 1,95, a figure below even the more defensive European championships like Italy's.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE chairman of the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Evaluation Commission, Dr Thomas Bach, refused to sing the praises of Cape Town's bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games before his departure on Tuesday.  But the absence of an Ode to Joy from Bach should not set any alarm bells ringing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bach and the rest of his 15-strong commission have maintained their impartiality throughout their three-month long inspection tour of the 11 candidate cities. In so doing they have consistently declined invitations to compare the merits of the candidates or to highlight the positive and negative features of each city's proposals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What they did agree to reveal, in the interests of good public relations no doubt, were three strong arguments in favour of each city's bid. In Athens these were the overwhelming support from the people of Greece, guarantees from both the incumbent government and the main opposition party, and an exciting cultural programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cape Town, Bach was impressed by the comprehensive support from all levels of government, the proficiency of the peninsula's transportation plan, and the creative &quot;Journey to Light the Sky&quot; schools' programme covering the bid and Olympism. Such compliments divulge little, however, about the overall ability of a city to cope with the rigours of staging the world's single biggest event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What should be encouraging for Cape Town though is that the commission did not pick up any major deficiencies in its technical proposals. Indeed it was Cape Town's transport plan, perhaps the most crucial element in any strategy to host the Games, which solicited a definite thumbs up from the commission.  The unequivocal support of the world's most popular statesman also sent out the kind of signals the IOC is looking for. President Mandela, who was made honorary president of the bid last week, was particularly forthright in his communications to the commission but the same message was also delivered by other members of his Cabinet as well as the regional and local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I and my colleagues are here to show just how determined we are to win this bid. My government has already recorded our absolute guarantee of the financial viability of these Games but today we wish to say to you, as directly as we can: give us these Games. We are ready for them. They will be good for us. They will be good for Africa. They will be good for the spirit of the Olympic movement,&quot; declared the president at the ceremony welcoming the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally important to the success of the bid is the level of public support.  The voracious letter-writing campaigns of the mainly white, middle-class Mother Grundys from Cape Town's affluent southern suburbs and the far less conspicuous activities of such groups as the Stop 2004 Olympic Bid Forum could give the appearance of a popular uprising against the bid to the casual observer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the commission's credit it met representatives from the different organisations harbouring concerns about the bid and by all accounts gave them a fair hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also met the two-week-old pro-bid Cape Town Community Olympic Forum which claims widespread support from civic and other community organisations.  Bach knows full well, however, that none of the cities could hope to have unanimous support and said he would have been suspicious if Cape Town had claimed 100% backing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two opinion polls conducted at the end of last year indicated 80% of the population was in favour of the bid and support seems to be growing as Olympic fever takes hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately the Bid company would appear to be its own worst enemy when it comes to addressing some of its more outspoken adversaries. Every single aspect of the bid should be thoroughly scrutinised to ensure that nothing has escaped the attention of the Bid company, government or Development Bank who carried out a full audit of the Games proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Development Bank's report in fact provides the most alluring argument of all for bringing the Games to Cape Town. Ninety thousand permanent jobs countrywide, a R30- billion boost to the national economy, and R8,3-billion in extra tax revenue which more than compensates for the government's expected contribution to the Games of R3- billion, are just some of the benefits the bank predicts will accrue between September 1997 and 2006 should the IOC award the Olympics to Africa for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such macro-economic projections are nebulous at best though and are generally based on the same recycled figures generated by a handful of multi- national accounting firms whose services are engaged on every Olympic bid and every Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is that the infrastructure and facilities for the Games can, and often do, cost much more than the original estimates. It is also true, however, that there is nothing quite like the Olympic Games for rejuvenating a city and providing a focus for fast-track development. If properly managed the Games can leave a lasting legacy and put a city and country firmly on the world map.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it is impossible to put a price on the publicity generated by hosting the Games, it must also be remembered that a few unforeseen hiccups, like those experienced in Atlanta this year, can leave a city with a lasting image problem. But, as with the sporting competitions the Games showcase, the old maxim of, &quot;If you don't enter the race you won't win the prize&quot;, also applies to the contest to host the Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven of the world's leading cities are convinced that the opportunities offered by the Games far outweigh the pitfalls and each, like Cape Town, hopes to be in the race when the IOC's selection college trims the number of entrants down to four or five in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the technical report drawn up by Bach's commission will provide some guidance to this process the obscure and secretive workings of the IOC don't always allow for the obvious. That said, for political and sentimental reasons, Cape Town should go all the way to the wire at the election in Lausanne next September. Expect Athens, Rome, Stockholm and Buenos Aires to be there too.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Sometimes an unbeaten record can be as much of a burden as a bad run of losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIKE painters, musicians and sculptors, cricketers are very often not appreciated until they are dead - or at least retired. India seems to be full of &quot;former greats&quot; at the moment, many of whom were dropped from the national side on any number of occasions and routinely criticised for one thing or another. Too slow, too loose, too selfish etc ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But their achievements on the field of play are now regarded as intrinsic to the national sides of the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties. The full worth of Kepler Wessels to South African cricket, likewise, never appeared to be understood by South Africans while he was captian.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When India toured South Africa in 1992 Wessels was as hard and uncompromising a captain as India had ever faced. The senior professionals (Azharuddin, Kapil Dev, Ravi Shastri) felt as though they were always short of air on the field of play. Wessels did not allow the opposition breathing space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hansie Cronje appears to have inherited some of Wessels's mental fortitude but, refreshingly, he breathes extra life into the game rather than choking it. The approach of the two captains is different and circumstances vary - the most obvious being that Wessels never brought a team to India - but comparisons are inevitably made. Apart from toughness, Cronje also inherited a great burden. An unbeaten record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the third evening of the last Test (with India 270-5 and leading by 330 runs) Cronje was disappointed with some South African newspapers for writing the team off and implying that India would win. Apparently (and it was a private conversation so I cannot be sure - Cronje's public persona has and will probably always remain impeccable) he was really very upset, suggesting that he would like to take a rolled-up copy of the offending newspaper and place it up the ... well, you can guess, after the team left Kanpur with a draw and a tied series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that all cricket followers in their right minds had written South Africa off is neither here nor there. The point is that Cronje had just realised what an awesome record (and burden) he had inherited from Wessels.  His desparation not to be the first captain to lose a series for five years was so strong that it literally became tangible, expressing itself in unusual behaviour and not completely rational thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also expressed itself on the field of play on the fourth morning when India raced to 400-7 declared in the face of some decidedly confused bowling and fielding. For the first time in two months on Indian soil Cronje didn't look in control of proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even at Eden Gardens when Azharuddin was dementedly thrashing a century from 74 balls the captain had the presence of mind to reassure Lance Klusener and calm the rest of his shell-shocked soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on the fourth morning in Kanpur he looked like a man preoccupied. One can only surmise what was passing through his mind but it must, inevitably, have revolved around the concept of defeat. In that session 130 runs were scored, when the average over the first three days had been just 70. Cronje was steeling himself for what he was dreaming would be a glorious rearguard action and a Test saved. But he probably knew, too, that he was dreaming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article is being written on the fourth evening with South Africa 127-5, surely destined for defeat. Of the five wickets that fell, four seemed to reflect the riotous emotions that beset the captain and surely rubbed off on the rest of the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Kirsten must have known that he had hit the ball only after it had hit his pad and would not, in different circumstances, have been as distraught over an LBW decision that was actually a brave and skilful piece of umpiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herschelle Gibbs, reminding himself all the time that he should leave as many deliveries as possible, was caught in two minds with the delivery that removed his off stump, initially wanting to leave he realised too late that he should play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the worst case of desperation was the dismissal of Daryll Cullinan who will no doubt be roundly chastised for attempting a risky single with the total reading 29-2 and South Africa needing 461 to win. But running dangerous singles is merely one example of what happens when batsmen are churned up by a range of powerful emotions. He might have flashed at a wide delivery outside off stump, pulled a long hop to square leg or played a reverse sweep.  Instead, he ran himself out. Pressure does that. Cullinan should not be singled out for harsh treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strangest dismissal was that of the captain himself. Having played an innings of complete control and composure to reach the 20s, he became consumed with the idea of attack and promptly took 16 off one over from left- arm spinner Sunil Joshi and raced to his first 50 of the series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Possibly caught up in the notion of &quot;playing your natural game&quot; he attacked once too often and fell into the trap that he sets so often himself as captain. Short cover was there to accept the catch as Cronje drove uppishly at a flighted delivery from Joshi. Pressure does that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Woolmer and Cronje will have to fight hard to stop recriminations and destructive introspection when the Test ( and the series) has been lost.  (Apologies in advance to Brian McMillan and Dave Richardson should they bat for six hours on the final day.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is only natural, and heatlhy, to hold debriefing sessions after any exercise but even the Indian press contingent have heard &quot;off the record&quot; mutterings from some South African bowlers that they have done their job but the batsmen have only produced runs when the going was good and have not been prepared to fight it out when conditions were more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the bowlers do have a point. The series should already have been won.  Chasing 170 to win in the final innings of the first Test at Ahmedebad was more than possible - the memory of the dismal collapse to 105 all out banished so gloriously to the back of the mind after Eden Gardens, has now become almost impossible to bear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India, meanwhile, continue on their oh-so- familiar rollercoaster of form and happiness. The mood of the team, and of the nation for that matter, depends only on the last result. Sachin Tendulkar is once again the toast of the people and those who would have had him removed as captain had India lost this series, are once again his friends. But we know, as the Indian team does, that wallpaper is not the same as cement in covering deep cracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These cracks, no doubt, will reappear in South Africa where India will be touring with a squad containing all the right numbers as far as provincial &quot; quotas&quot; are concerned, but nothing else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven batsmen, two spinners, three wicketkeepers (?) and just two back-up seamers to support the already overworked Javagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad will surely come unstuck on South African wickets and then, hopefully for Cronje's sake, the pain of losing a series that he knows South Africa could and should have won, will ease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Wearied by nine months of hard rugby the Springboks need to gather themselves for one final effort on Sunday to end the marathon season on high note</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANOTHER weekend, another Test. Welcome to the bright new world of professional rugby. Actually it's not just one Test this weekend but three, for while South Africa play Wales on Sunday, England host Argentina on Saturday and Italy pop in to Murrayfield to take on Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Hemisphere players are already starting to feel the pace of the all-singing, all-dancing new era of rugby where huge wage bills equal more rugby. Not necessarily better, just more.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will understandably raise a smile from the Springboks whose season, which ends on Sunday, began back in February. Nine months of intense rugby, Super 12, Currie Cup, Tri- Nations, a Test series against the All Blacks and a season-end tour of Argentina, France and Wales. For some of them it adds up to about 40 games of rugby, perhaps more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, while many British journalists raised their eyebrows in disbelief when coach Andre Markgraaff revealed this week's training plans (&quot;none&quot;), it makes perfect sense. How much fitter and more honed can these players get? Golf will give them the chance to relax and refresh the batteries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only danger is that the minds will not be refocused in time, although judging by the way in which Markgraaff and his two lieutenants Hugh Reece- Edwards and Nick Mallet have operated this far on tour, there is every likelihood that the Springboks will be as well prepared as they were in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the physical fatigue of a long season, a 2-0 series win was a triumph for all concerned, but especially Markgraaff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A big, affable man with hands like buckets and a moustache straight from the Alamo, Markgraaff was the butt of a torrent of abuse after dropping Francois Pienaar. Criticism was in order, but hardly the hate mail and vitriolic messages which clogged up his fax machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it transpired, the absence of Pienaar has barely been noticed on the field where Ruben Kruger, Andre Venter and Gary Teichmann now form a formidable back row. Off the field Teichmann has also coped excellently with the high PR standards set by his predecessor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Markgraaff will ever receive praise for his decision remains to be seen. But he showed he could make the upopular decisions when necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quality of the Springboks' rugby has also come in for criticism.  Northern Hemisphere commentators apparently delight in knocking South African rugby for its failure to thrill crowds with explosive running rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be fair, however, they do have a point. The Boks have been cagey, working the ball through the forwards, punching holes, sucking in defences and then exploiting the gaps. Sure, sometimes its not pretty but on this tour winning was important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markgraaff has stuck to his guns. He wants to see South Africa play in the Natal style and claims this tour is as much about preparation for the British Lions next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Make no mistake, this side is getting better and better and if we are lucky with injuries I think they'll hammer the Lions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So said Markgraaff in Paris. And given a bit of tinkering such as the return perhaps of Os du Randt and Chester Williams, then there is no doubt this is the side he would like to see lining up against the Lions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, victory on Sunday is important. The Welsh might fancy their chances although the absence of Scott Quinnell, still arguing about money, will set them back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two new faces in lock Mark Rowley, who replaces Derwyn Jones and flanker Dale McIntosh. Like a lucky charm, the Welsh appear to have adopted token Kiwis. McIntosh, middle name Manawa, is from King County in New Zealand and finally gets the nod after flirting with Scotland for whom he played in the &quot;A&quot; side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McIntosh has been in fine form for Pontypridd but his elevation comes at the expense of injured countryman, in both senses, Hemi TakaTawa Taylor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this rate it seems a sure bet that Kevin Barry Putt, formerly of Waikato, will also win his first cap on Sunday for the Springboks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Reconciliation Through Truth by Kader Asmal, Louise Asmal, Ronald Suresh Roberts (David Philip/Mayibuye, R49,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advantage of a late review is the opportunity it provides to take on board what has already appeared. In this case there has been an exchange of views in newspaper columns between the authors and Professor Hermann Giliomee of the University of Cape Town and current president of the South African Institute of Race Relations, with others joining in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exchange has been so acrimonious and the insults so personal that there appears to be a history behind it. No doubt Giliomee's feelings were also inflamed by the book's abrasively dismissive references to his previously expressed views in which he disparaged African National Congress electoral success.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a debate, if one may call it that, which Giliomee cannot win. Neither reason nor emotion are on his side and in trying to attack the book as he has he lands up, no doubt unintentionally, as an apologist for the discredited previous regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three authors in their turn are on the side of the angels. The core of their argument is that for South Africa to go forward it must confront its past and this can only be done &quot;on the recognition that apartheid was a terrible evil&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, of course, is not an original thought, but the authors present it with a passion and fluency which grip the mind and imagination. They go on from this starting point to argue for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission not &quot;the triumphalist approach of victors' justice, with its inevitable selectiveness and political opportunism&quot; but rather taking the form of &quot; apology and renunciation of past atrocities as a precondition of amnesty&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book was evidently written before and during the commission's existence, so it both anticipates and reports its doings. Thus far the book's arguments for the commission have been amply borne out: the searing, agonising details which have been pouring out of the hearings are justification, if any had ever been needed, of the commission's purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book's denunciations of apartheid as &quot;a crime against humanity&quot; and as &quot; genocide&quot; are based on declarations and findings by United Nations bodies.  The approach tends to be legalistic and perhaps reflects the role of Kader Asmal in a previous life as a professor of law at an Irish university and his work, together with his wife and co-author, Louise, in opposing apartheid internationally. But none of this detracts from the justice of what they say and the more that Giliomee seeks to deny it the more defensive about the past he seems to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is a pity because in past times he was a thoughtful commentator and he could have done better, for himself and everyone else, to have concentrated on the parts of the book which deserve criticism. For not only is there evidence of sloppy research as in speaking of 11 000 arrests under the Public Safety Act in 1960 when in fact there were some 2 000 political detentions with another 18 000 people arrested as &quot;vagrants&quot; but among the wearying repetitiousness there is also a tendency to rely on words without exploring and explaining the context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the authors treat seriously and at some length Judge Tienie Steyn's commission in 1982 into the media. They thus give Steyn considerably more credibility than he enjoyed at the time. From the then government's point of view he served a purpose in supporting propaganda about &quot;total onslaught&quot; but his report of hundreds of pages then disappeared from view because it was widely perceived, even in official circles, as the meandering musings of an amiable but eccentric man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole discussion about the press is disappointing in its shallowness.  Yes, as the authors say, the Newspaper Press Union, the organisation of proprietors, did repeatedly cave in to government pressure and yes, most of the press was into ignorant denial. On the other hand, there was enough resistance to ensure that a good deal of the truth about the evils of apartheid was made known so that no one, whether at home or abroad, could ever claim complete ignorance about what was happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These weaknesses apart, the authors get into one of the most burning controversies of the moment in describing the ANC and the apartheid government as, respectively, &quot;the world's most law-abiding liberation movement&quot; and &quot;the world's most lawless bureaucracy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the struggle between them, &quot;The anti- apartheid resistance, under- resourced and reduced to the status of exiles and refugees ... committed scattered human rights infringements amounting to departures from its primary humanist goals ... In contrast, apartheid's administrators, deliberately rejecting humanism and civilised international norms, formally implemented avowedly 'abnormal' measures in the conscious and deliberate defence of a crime against humanity. These things inhabit different, fundamentally incompatible, moral universes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is well put. But does it follow that ANC members are not to be called to account for their actions? The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will shortly be getting to grips with the question when it comes to consider applications for amnesty being submitted by ANC members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who is to be given amnesty and why is bound up with our country's future moral health and with relationships between people. The issue deserves the widest possible airing. This book gives valuable and timely direction to the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Pogrund is a former deputy editor of the Rand Daily Mail. His book on that paper will appear next year</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - LAPALEBOMBO: An African Paradise by Gill Bosonetto (Puffin, R59,99)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE concept is great. All the sentiments are in the right place. Ulla Blake's illustrations are charming. What a pity the author feels the need to anthropomorphise her animal characters in a particularly twee way! Imagine, if you will, a giraffe called Camilla, a baby duiker called Lilliput, a nyala called Angus and these are members of what Gill Bosonetto generically terms &quot; the Wild Ones&quot;, the untamed inhabitants of the &quot;vast plains ... the shining waters ... the empty skies&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Bosonetto's LapaLebombo is a &quot;fantasy place&quot;, the part of the country in which she has set it is very real indeed Maputaland in northern KwaZulu-Natal an area which requires careful conservation-oriented management if it is to survive and with it, the wild things which inhabit it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the young readers who will visit this fantasy place, there is plenty to learn about the habits of these creatures of the wild and the threats posed by human interference. Each chapter deals with a separate set of animal characters and characteristics, the problem is that though the animals might act like animals, the author has vested them with the ability to think human thoughts and speak human words in ways which simply didn't work for this reviewer at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps it is not a problem when you are pre- teen (at whom I assume this book is addressed). But it is a nagging irritation when you are an adult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all that, this is an attractive offering. The stories are varied and well written, the narrative should certainly carry the young readers along with it, and the theme the need to save our threatened wilderness areas weaves its way through the tales in a way which cannot but impress itself on young minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A glossary giving thumbnail descriptions of the creatures mentioned in the book, their characteristics and their habits, is a useful addition for youthful environmentalists who want to add some fact to the fantasy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all ends happily-ever-after with the conservationists moving in, the fences coming down and the animals declaring their faith in the ability of the human animals to preserve them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'We will live in harmony at LapaLebombo, we will survive,' they chorused.  And, with a collective kick of their heels or swish of their tails, they split up to spread the good news to all the animals&quot; ... !</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THESE THINGS HAPPEN by Shaun de Waal, (Ad Donker, R59,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT over 200 pages, this is a generous collection a dozen stories, one of them, &quot;Dave&quot;, a wonderfully sustained piece, taking up a quarter of the book.  All but four of the stories are on gay life, one way or another even so, the collection never settles into sameness. In his debut collection, Mail &amp; Guardian literary editor Shaun de Waal seems deliberately to foreground the range of his work, its variety.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the stories that don't touch on gay life, one, The Priest's Story, is set, more-or- less, in Mozambique in the years of the civil war. De Waal's skill here is in coming so close to Graham Greeneland and yet creating a story that isn't derivative. At the centre, certainly, is a crisis of conscience as, thrown into a role as vital liaison in the peace process, a priest must contemplate carrying out a just killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another story (But Isn't He Dead?) deals with the lives of a jazz pianist and African National Congress exiles in London. Red Rover covers the crisis of a party veteran leading his comrades out of a stadium demonstration to be mown down by bantustan troops. Though no location is specified, the publication of this story now has fresh relevance as the debate simmers over the provenance of the marching orders that ended in the Bisho massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the book's opening story, Jacaranda Street, De Waal depicts a young boy's fascination with a reclusive elderly man the narrator's assumption of the boy's consciousness is entirely convincing, steeped in private logic, apparently inconsequential, always veering off at tangents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The title story is about splitting up. Like those of other stories here, its structure is alive, not just a scheme but built to lead step by unpredictable step into a solid sense of the weight and complexity of a dilemma. As the book's blurb puts it, these are stories that &quot;deal with people at turning points in their lives, or at moments when the truth becomes unavoidable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Struggles to touch the truth are the subject of X and I the story that (intentionally, I guess) ends the book at its deepest level of disquiet. It is a piece of &quot;faction&quot; (or documentary such a question is part of its theme) on the author's encounters with the late Afrikaans short story writer Koos Prinsloo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest success is perhaps the least expected, the long story &quot;Dave&quot;.  Here is the diary of a middle-aged gay man infatuated with a male model (or prostitute, or someone just like him doubt on which the story pivots). What could have been a hackneyed piece is, as it turns out, tense, poignant and funny, owing to De Waal's complete success in capturing the diarist's voice, obsessed with &quot;Dave&quot;, confiding to the page, wittering on, a little brave and more than a little naff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wish me luck,&quot; he instructs his diary as he goes to meet &quot;Dave&quot;, and we do: there's something of a triumph here in a story that gives so much fun and that generates so much empathy for its narrator.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE disastrous Melville 100th birthday party in Johannesburg two weeks ago has run into money troubles. A meeting between creditors and the Melville Organising Committee was held at a lawyer's office last week but no one from the committee would talk to the press.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week creditors were told the Melville Organising Committee had R30 000 in its bank account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PJ Powers's band leader Tagger Reunert said the committee's full debt was R300 000. The band was given a deposit but awaits the balance of its fee.  Reunert added: &quot;This means creditors will be paid 10 cents of every rand they are owed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) conductor Richard Cock said the list of creditors was two pages long and included suppliers and musicians, the security company and Pro- Sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 50% upfront deposit is the norm with music acts, the balance being paid after the performance. Some musicians have not been issued the balance payment at all while others, like Wendy Oldfield, found that the cheque for the full fee had bounced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NSO was given a 50% deposit cheque, which was refused by a bank because the wrong signatures were on it, said Cock. &quot;We asked for it to be corrected and we got our deposit, but the second cheque, the balance of payment issued on the day we played, was refused by the bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A manager who refused to sign her bands to the event said the organisers told her there was no money for deposits. &quot;What right have any organisers got to place the risk on the band? They said they didn't have a sponsor for the music and I refused to get involved on that basis. I felt there would be resistance from the public to the R20 entrance fee anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Cape Town Symphony Orchestra (CTSO) will close unless R2- million is found before next Tuesday. This is the warning of CTSO publicist Shirley de Kock, who has embarked on a desperate rescue mission to save the beleagured orchestra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the 82-year old veteran goes under, De Kock says, the future of the SABC's National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) and the Natal Philharmonic Orchestra (NPO) the mainsprings of South African classical music will also be in jeopardy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crisis comes in the aftermath of the government's White Paper on Arts Culture, Science and Technology, which advocates transforming the four performing arts councils (PACs) to partially funded &quot;community theatres&quot; and the establishment of a national arts council (NAC) to serve as a statutory body to allocate funds to deserving cultural projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In future the performing arts councils will have to line up alongside historically disadvantaged organisations for a slice of the meagre funding pie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said De Kock: &quot;It forms part of Capab, so the CTSO will inevitably be severely affected by cutbacks. The only way for it to survive is to merge with the Cape Philharmonic Orchestra.&quot; But before the merger can take place R10-million has to be found. To date the CTSO has only R8-million at its disposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are appealing to the corporate sector to assist in providing the extra R2-million, but it seems they are more willing to plunge millions into a rugby match than contribute to an art form that benefits everyone,&quot; De Kock said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also of concern is the financial situation of the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) which belongs to the SABC. It is widely known that SABC budget cutbacks are likely to hit the NSO harder than any other SABC sector.  This means South Africa's two major cities are in danger of losing their classical orchestras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the eve of his departure for America last week, Archbishop Desmond Tutu called for Cape Town's citizens and corporations to help secure classical music.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A retrospective of JArgen Schadeberg's work over the last 40 years confirms his enduring photographic eye. HAZEL FRIEDMAN spoke to him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT takes a strange kind of eye to be able to see life constantly through a lens -- a kind of nomadic outsider-looking-inside perspective and a remarkable degree of detached curiosity. Not to mention a simple desire to tell stories in pictures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JArgen Schadeberg possesses those sensibilities. He also has the ability to extract beauty from apparent banality. And unlike many of the flashier news photographers who wilt between adrenalin hits like junkies between fixes, he focuses as much on the spaces between the frames as the frozen moments themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is tempting to idealise the man as much as one does his work. He is, after all, the photographer who practically launched a generation of black photographers, some of whom remain South Africa's brightest photography stars.  During his Drum years he also epitomised the romantic image of the photographer as handsome, reckless hero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Schadeberg has also been accused of remaining arrogantly frozen in an era immortalised in Drum magazine: Sophiatown in the 1950s. Even though his more recent work of Bushman initiation rites has received acclaim and his short films are shown on television and at festivals worldwide, the name Schadeberg remains attached to a time of forced removals, jazz kings, shebeen queens and skokiaan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His retrospective casts a more enduring light on the photographer commonly dubbed South Africa's own Eisenstaedt. Divided into three components -- the Drum years; his later work in Britain and Europe freelancing; images of South Africa in the last two decades -- Schadeberg has whittled 2 000 work prints down to a mere 300. Instead of going the conventional route of displaying them in chronological order, he has juxtaposed diverse images, sometimes from different eras, establishing a series of conceptual correspondences or tensions between them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, his series of wedding photographs generates a sense of universalism through a rite of passage practised by every colour, class and creed. And his images of white South Africa set up a tension with those indelibly dynamic scenes from Sophiatown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inevitably, the exhibition also charts Schadeberg's professional evolution.  The compositions of the European pictures are more complex, and subtler in tone, compared with their starker, contrasty South African images.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all the images -- whether of writer Arthur Maimane seated in the Drum offices, looking part-dandy, part-debt collector, or of a little girl skating joyously in England -- are clearly the product of some precious moments. &quot;I was afraid to publish that one,&quot; he says, pointing to Party Girl, the image of a wench practically bursting though her bustier in a London discotheque. &quot; I had gone to this club to photograph a pop star, but was completely fascinated by what seemed to me -- if it wasn't for her convincing breasts -- to be a drag queen. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dagga Smokers resembles Van Gogh's Potato Eaters with its gritty, rough- hewn realism. They were a bunch of outies spliffing spiritual smoke in a derelict Sophiatown doorway during the early 1950s. &quot;They were delighted to be photographed,&quot; recalls Schadeberg. &quot;At first they clowned around a bit but then they simply carried on doing their thing, oblivious to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to train your eye to see certain way,&quot; he explains.&quot;Its like learning to paint a single Zen brushtroke to depict a bamboo stick on canvas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear from his photographic opus that Schadeberg's canvas is far from completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schadeberg's work can be seen at the Johannesburg Art Gallery until January 5</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Can a picture sell a thousand songs? GWEN ANSELL reports on the makeshift state of South African CD cover design, and some fresh new ideas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ITS enemies claim that South African mass- market pop all sounds the same.  Even its fans can't deny that it all looks the same. Check out the serried ranks of cassettes by the taxi stop. Paul Ndlovu, deep-etched in half- profile against sludgy green. Phuza Khemisi, deep-etched in half-profile against faded blue. Johnny Mokhali in a white suit -- in half profile, deep- etched.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few full portraits, bordered in tones either dull or lurid. For the very latest, ethno-tacky design incorporating triangles and squiggles in mismatched primaries, often paired with unlikely animal skins. CDs, where they exist, fare little better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turned around, these covers are equally unpromising: no credits, little or no artist information, mis-spelt words and a listing bearing only a distant relationship to the real running order. Mzwakhe Mbuli's latest album cover got it so wrong last week that even The Star's reviewer complained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet designers who try to break the mould find it tough. Hedwig Barry -- designer of Tananas's Unamanacua -- workshopped intensively with the band to find the right image. &quot;We wanted something which used contemporary South African iconography,&quot; she says, &quot;without the Afro-clichGs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is stunning. In strong blacks, reds and yellows, a Lion matchbox, a domestic worker's gloves, plastic bucket and Sunlight soap, a snarling guard dog (&quot;Actually, she's yawning,&quot; says Barry), a Rizla pack and a loaf of Ekapa bread assert a quirky, distinctive South Africa. But Barry had to go through what she mildly calls &quot;a long process of negotiation&quot; before the Gallo label accepted her concept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Gallo deserves praise for finally being flexible and taking on something new,&quot; she says. &quot;I've worked with other companies that simply wouldn't listen at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before agreement, Barry was faced with a barrage of counter-arguments &quot; mostly from people with no background in design.&quot; Gallo queried placing &quot;low- value&quot; products like matches on the cover. They said branded products should pay to be featured. They suggested the images were &quot;too localised; not internationally acceptable.&quot; Finally, they retreated to &quot;But we always use the artists' faces -- or real ethnic images.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;... Whatever they are,&quot; comments Barry. &quot;As with the music itself, what will be most internationally acceptable is a unique South African identity.  And, particularly today, that involves developing something that is not clichG d; not neatly fitted into categories, racial or otherwise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent record company Tic Tic Bang established its own design arm in the process of rescuing Urban Creep's latest album from what art director Mallory de Kock calls the &quot;awful, wholly inappropriate&quot; design concept generated by a mainstream cover designer. &quot;This album was a lot darker in tone than the previous one,&quot; says de Kock. &quot;We needed a design equally dark, to echo the music in the graphics. That whole way of thinking is foreign to mainstream sleeve design, which is characterised by a total lack of daring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One record company A&amp;R man, who preferred not to be named, was bemused by this desire for innovation and daring. &quot;The important thing is product recognition. You can't do anything too fancy; people are not used to it. And for traditional music, many of the rural buyers don't read -- so you have to show the artist's picture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's typical, feels De Kock of the &quot;mindless, un-researched assumptions made by the music industry about what the South African public wants. It's appallingly patronising.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even photographers, who might be expected to welcome cover portrait commissions, don't agree. Freelancer Peter McKenzie, who's done commission work for a number of record companies, feels that &quot;currently, record companies don't place any value on the photographer's artistic judgment or input. They call on a photographer at the last minute, set up the artists against a white background somewhere -- and produce endless, boring covers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKenzie points out that the Professional Photographers' Association of South Africa (PPSA) evaluates the photographic input to a product launch as at least 10 percent. &quot;But what we're normally paid doesn't even amount to one percent. And we're not involved in the creative process. We need to hear the music, learn about the artist as a person, understand the album concept, advise on clothes, makeup and the best siting for the picture. Then, even if they want portraits, we could at least create images which actually say something about the album and don't make racist assumptions about black music buyers' taste.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Tananas demonstrated, artists would also like a say in the process.  Kerry Friedman, the band's manager, says: &quot;We got the cover we wanted in part because the whole band worked for it. Musicians must realise they can take the initiative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Barry, there are important lessons from her experience with Gallo. &quot;The South African music industry still needs a greater degree of openness to new ideas. And it needs something it's never had before: an infrastructure that helps external collaborations to work. You can, after all, get great promo out of a good sleeve.&quot; De Kock agrees: &quot;I've worked in music retailing for years. A good cover always makes a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - ONE of the most enduring images I have of Hugh Masekela is that of stocky man surrounded by a band, hand raised and confronting an audience of rowdy revellers who would rather be sitting at a shebeen regaling each other with stories of sexual conquest than listening to jazz music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would sometimes last up to an embarrassing 10 minutes, with Masekela insisting on their silence and them drunkenly ignoring him. There is, of course, another image of Hugh, cheeks puffed out as he makes furious love to a flugelhorn -- a lovemaking that gave birth to the hauntingly beautiful sounds of Ntyilo Ntyilo, one of the standards of South African jazz.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are probably the only images one will remember these days because he no longer has to perform at shebeens like Kippies. He now has his own jazz club and the only people who go there will be people who actually want to listen to music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hugh Masekela has opened J&amp;B Junction at the Piccadilly Centre in Yeoville.  It's sandwiched between a Chinese Food joint and a teenage hangout joint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hugh's Junction is intended to be an island of civilisation in the barbaric sea of kwaito and mindless rap. The place seats 300 patrons has been embraced with a fair deal of enthusiasm by the trendy jazz-loving set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday it was packed as people negotiated their way up the stairs to the entrance trying to avoid the drunken teenagers. Once in the Junction, we were rewarded with truly soothing music -- that comes at a price. You pay R26 on the understanding that when Masekela is on stage, you shut up and listen.  (One person discovered this rule when I was there. He will either never set foot in the club again or, when he does, he will be one of the best behaved patrons.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these have been few and far between. Maybe the cover price, with bookings at Computicket, is the reason that the riff raff keeps out. (Riff raff in this instance usually has a cellular phone and an inflated sense of self. It usually finds itself at such a place on a Friday evening after spending the day drinking. )</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I understand the need for silence and respect for performers, I must confess that the few times I have been to Hugh's joint I have been so browbeaten that I have been afraid to sneeze, let alone talk, during a performance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - ANDREW WORSDALE reports on Ties of Blood, a new TV documentary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NIGHT after night television viewers are subjected to a barrage of material about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. So why make a 40-minute documentary about the guilt and violence of the past? Ties of Blood, which flights on SABC3 at 8.15pm on December 16 (a day redolent with differing symbolic associations for South Africans), is not the usual tearjerking reportage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioned by SABC3's Christa Joubert, produced by Mark Newman of Phakati Films, written by ex-Mail &amp; Guardian journalist Philip Van Niekerk and directed by Brenda Goldblatt; the documentary is a refreshingly unsentimental take on the process of reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week I watched a first cut of the film while Goldblatt, Van Niekerk and editor Christine Hodges rushed to meet their deadline. Despite the pressure, they seemed happy about the documentary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Goldblatt: &quot;It's not a conventional piece about who's right or wrong.  If you're going to deal with reconciliation things aren't all hunky dory.  People are not that willing to forgive. We struggled with the subject and tried to come up with an approach that's honest and fresh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially intended as an exposure of different families subjected to the rigours of apartheid, the documentary took on a new shape as filming progressed; the result is a work that doesn't shy from the horrors of the past. Also, it mercifully avoids an idealistic Simunye type of togetherness; instead it is a rather sad and realistic reflection of what our nation has done to itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appropriately enough, the programme begins at Blood River, where, as Goldblatt says, &quot;we can trace all our warrior traditions to, even Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) was founded on December 16, 1961.&quot; The Afrikaner nation's reverence for what was originally known as the Dingaan's Day should never be underestimated. Says Constand Viljoen in the film: &quot;It will forever be a symbol for the Afrikaner people and if you allow Blood River to be taken away from the Afrikaner people then we will disintegrate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film-makers found humble farmer Johannes Nkosi near the historical site of bloody conflict. At the end of the film Nkosi remarks, &quot;I wake up very, very happy every morning!&quot; He bears no bitterness about the past and has only hope for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another of the documentary's strengths is the way it exposes how difficult healing the scars of the past can be. Wilhelm Verwoerd, Stellenbosch University philosophy lecturer, Hendrik's grandson and one of the film's most interesting interviewees says: &quot;Sometimes I don't even want to use the word reconciliation because I think it becomes cheap. I think people just use it too easily ... we'll have to deal with these issues, so that helps me not to believe inthe sort of quick fix, microwave picture of reconciliation.&quot; Scriptwriter van Niekerk agrees: &quot;Reconciliation can't be forced, it can't be done by committee and that's what the film says.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked Goldblatt if the film wasn't guilty of Afrikaner-bashing? &quot;Not at all,&quot; she replied. &quot;We're trying to air the sense of despair and the Afrikaners do have a sense of being bashed right now. They've been attacked psychologically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documentary remains distinctly non- judgmental -- even in its profile of murderers Paul Van Vuuren and Jacques Hechter who've applied for amnesty for killing 43 people. Says Hechter on camera: &quot;I have no right to ask to be forgiven. If I get amnesty it is purely out of the forgiving consciousness of the people of South Africa. It is not a right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Vuuren feels differently and firmly believes he did nothing wrong. At the time, he asserts, they were fighting a legitimate war. This point is, ironically enough, underscored by ex- MK cadre Thula Bophela: &quot;We shouldn't maybe get too moral about acts of war; war is not moral. Like when you are in a plane and you have to bomb a city, the bombs can fall on a hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shot on Betacam by Peter Baker, the documentary is a mix of talking heads, archival footage and elegiac imagery. &quot;The style,&quot; says Goldblatt, &quot;is almost photographic. We tried to allow things to happen within the frame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ties of Blood is an important film that doesn't use its issues as a soap- box or news- room piece, it refuses to kowtow to the conventional idea of a rainbow nation and peels off a layer to look at the deeper issues haunting the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ties of Blood is on SABC3 at 8.15pm on December 16</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - WRITTEN by talented young musician and composer Bongani Ndodana, South Africa's first Xhosa opera, Temba and Seliba, premiered at the 1820 Settlers National Monument in Grahamstown on December 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nederburg Opera Prize-winner Gwyneth Lloyd researched and wrote the libretto for Temba and Seliba, a love story based on a conflation of two Xhosa legends. She also sang the role of Seliba, queen of the underwater realm who heals and empowers the crippled Temba (Ayanda Songongo) so he can win the hand of his beloved Marina (sung by Jane Silver).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martha Munro, lecturer in voice at Pretoria Technikon, produced the opera, which was staged by Co-opera Ibali Lemculo in collaboration with the Grahamstown Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Silva, the Foundation's Director of Educational Projects, said: &quot;The aim of the Co-opera Ibali Lomculo company is to demystify opera; and their production was well-received by an opening-night audience of about 350. The Grahamstown Foundation is exploring the possibility of obtaining sponsorship to enable it to take the company abroad as one of the Foundation's ongoing projects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-opera Ibali Lomculo was formed last year with the encouragement of Eastern Cape MEC for Education and Culture Nosimo Balindlela, who suggested commissioning a Xhosa opera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Company members range in age from eight to 50-plus, and are drawn from communities across the Eastern Cape. They include both amateurs and professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ibali Lomculo means &quot;music stories&quot;, and the company aims to provide these for South African communities through performance and workshopping activities.  Because the company is a travelling one, costumes and sets are designed and made (by the singers themselves) to fit into a few cardboard boxes which can be transported in a single bakkie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bongani Ndodana, composer of their first commissioned opera, matriculated at St Andrew's College, Grahamstown, and in 1994 won a South African Music Rights Organisation (Samro) bursary to Rhodes University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grant from the Foundation for the Creative Arts enabled Ndodana to study music under Roelof Temmingh at the Stellenbosch University Conservatoire of Music during 1995. More than 20 of the young composer's works have been performed to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-opera Ibali Lomculo also aim to promote singing as a medium of communication. For &quot;the singing voice is common to all groups, and the creation of a performance with people from all culture groups can provide channels for constructive activity for both performers and audiences&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Temba and Seliba music director and accompanist, Dennis Stander, a lecturer in the Rhodes University Music Department, is a specialist in music education for disadvantaged students. And Gwyneth Lloyd, who lectures in singing at Rhodes, said: &quot;With Temba and Seliba I think we have succeeded in breaking down the elitist barriers traditionally associated with opera.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, the second half of the programme picked up the water theme (first introduced in Temba and Seliba in songs from various classical operas, including Purcell's Dido and Aeneas, the earliest opera written about Africa.  Solos from The Merry Widow, sung by Gwyneth Lloyd and student Roy Hobson, drew particularly enthusiastic applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Company will present Temba and Seliba at the Moederkerksaal in George on December 13 at 7.30pm</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - ANDREW WORSDALE reports on a new distribution deal that is conquering African television markets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local soap Egoli will soon be flighted on networks in Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. New enterprise, the African Barter Company, a joint venture between the Grey advertising group and American TV distributor Media Ventures, has sold M-Net's daily soapie through a bartering scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Grey group is one of the largest global advertising agencies, with offices in 72 countries and more multinational clients than any other agency.  Media Ventures International has movies like The Blues Brothers and series such as ER and The Untouchables on its books.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African Barter Company is based on an American system called &quot;barter programming&quot;. Quite simply, this involves distributing a programme to a network or station in exchange for a defined number of commercial spots; which the distributor then sells to advertisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's MD, Zimbabwean-born James Makawa, has extensive experience as a NBC News correspondent. Says Makawa: &quot;Dramatic changes in the television industry have caused stations to re-evaluate the way in which programming is acquired. Increased competition from pay, satellite and terrestrial stations has caused programme prices to rocket, viewership to fragment and the value of commercial spots to decrease ... all of these conditions call for a new way of doing business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system will enable stations to acquire quality programming from overseas without depleting their programming budget, so giving them more money to spend on local productions. Grey South Africa media director Paul Wilkins is cautious but enthusiastic about the new venture: &quot;It's basically a different way of facilitating the same business. The surf hasn't quite come up yet but we're going to make sure we stay on top of the waves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another area co-production, African Barter, M-Net and Media Ventures will produce a new series, provisionally titled Blue Diamonds. While the series sounds pretty dreadful to me, I'm not among the over one million viewers who catch Egoli every day. It's about an American family (sigh!) who move to Cape Town and get embroiled in a diamond smuggling racket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The press release reads, &quot;Against the backdrop of the strikingly beautiful Western Cape of South Africa, known as 'the fairest Cape in all the world', Blue Diamonds will explore human values and beliefs, explode tired old myths and trace the development of an exciting era through the unjaded eyes of a new generation.&quot; Full marks to the trite publicist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Barter has also chalked up other successes - in less than a month it has managed to acquire programming from several major US television studios and is constantly doing deals across the continent as well as in Europe. Makawa, who speaks in a hybrid American/Zimbabwean accent, is the perfect man for the job - elegant, youthful and energetic in a buppie way, he juggles several telephone calls at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Wilkins: &quot;Makawa is a real rock'n'roller. When I met him I grabbed him by the scruff of the neck because I knew he was the perfect man for the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thought of people in Kampala, Nairobi and Dar-Es-Salaam becoming hooked on the intrigues of Lynette, Beth and Kimberley in the leading local melodrama is perhaps scary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there are over 1 000 episodes available. Egoli has South Africa's largest fan club, nationwide roadshows that attract crowds of up to 70 000 people and has even inspired a celebrity cookbook. I bet they'll soon be serving sosaties on the streets of Harare.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The nature of SA art awards is changing to fit new realities.  HAZEL FRIEDMAN reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FNB Vita Art Now Award exhibition will soon be a thing of the past due to &quot;the closure of many art galleries in South Africa&quot;, says Vita director Phillip Stein. But there is no need as yet to write an obituary for one of the last of an almost extinct breed of local art competitions. Vita is not on its way out but up. From 1997 it will be reborn in another form, according to Stein, &quot;in order to adapt itself to changing times and circumstances&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Established in 1985, Vita has become the most accurate barometer of contemporary art countrywide, even though its selection process has revolved around Johannesburg exhibitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years a team of selectors -- critics, artists and curators -- has been visiting galleries throughout Johannesburg to assess their exhibitions.  Each show would be judged according to a points system. At the end of each quarter a winner would be chosen and at the award exhibition, held annually at the Johannesburg Art Gallery, an overall winner would receive the coveted prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Vita was first launched, the timing was appropriate,&quot; recalls Stein. &quot; There were many galleries and the political pressures were a powerful inspiration. Interest in black art was also growing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, 1985 is still widely regarded as the year that South African art came into its own. Paradoxically, one of the most repressive eras in South Africa's history -- the State of Emergency -- seemed to unleash an unprecedented wave of creative expression. Local art shed its also-ran skin and began focusing on the distortions of its own history and that of apartheid South Africa, in the process acquiring a subversive status that it might not have occupied in a normal society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those years were accompanied by the sprouting of a culture of art competitions, such as the Volkskas Atelier prize and the Cape Town Triennale which was sponsored by the Rembrandt Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by the Nineties the celebration was wearing thin. Labelled as elitist, the selection process was taken over by cultural workers intent on ensuring that competitions would be judged like lefty seminars. Rembrandt withdrew its sponsorship, having concluded that mud wrestling would probably be cleaner than cultural politics. Vita was also bruised, but not entirely battered, by accusations that it had become a cosy consensual cabal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vita was always dependent on the lynchpin of our art life: the commercial galleries,&quot; recalls Stein. &quot;They were this group of invisible people behind the scenes who determined what the public should see. And inevitably, although it was the most representative and democratic arts award, it was limited by its retrospective nature and the standard of art during a particular year. And now the closure of so many galleries and the dwindling museum budgets have changed the face of South African art.&quot; He adds: &quot;Over the years we've had to adjust and enlarge our parameters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways Vita is to South African art what Bill Clinton is to American politics: the proverbial comeback kid. It has outlived two of its three sponsors (AA Life and IGI) and is about to sign up with present sponsor First National Bank for another 3 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while it will discontinue its annual award exhibition, negotiations are currently under way for new arts projects to be launched in 1997. The first, in partnership with the Johannesburg Art Gallery, revolves around an artist- in-residence programme. The second involves establishing an award similar to the Turner Prize in the United Kingdom, whereby the public submits recommendations to a team of judges on four artists who will then be commissioned to make works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What remains unaltered though,&quot; says Stein, &quot;is Vita's ongoing commitment to recognising established talent and discovering new talent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - PRESSURE is high on the six Zambian golfers competing in the Zambia Open Golf tournament starting tomorrow at the Ndola Golf Club as foreign professionals are expected to stiffen the competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Zulu, who plays on handicap plus one, is the golfer who is expected to redeem Zambia's poor standing on the international golf map, and the presence of five other Zambians will even give him encouragement to aspire for the 22, 500 rands which has been set aside as the prize money.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tournament, which will be officiated by President, Fredrick Chiluba will see Zambia attempt to cause an upset through the likes of Rabson Kopulande, Sam Mwanza, Jones Nkandu, Paul Tembo , Peter Sinyamai and Kelvin Phiri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But before the Zambians can bask in the dream world, they have to face reality that Mark McNulty, recent winner of the Zimbabwe Open, is among the highly-respected world top sixty-five professional golfers that are participating in the competition, whose attendance has been put at seventy golfers, five of whom are amateurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambian golfers competing in this tournament have a rather tough task because of the presence of the South Africans and the Zimbabweans, but no one can rule them out,&quot; said a South African observer, Nic Lanhim, in a telephone interview from the Ndola Golf Club yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And according to Lanhim, the organising committee of the Ndola Golf Club, has worked flat out in organising the tournament, whose over-all monetary requirement has been fixed at a staggering K64m.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba today thanked Zambian soldiers and other wings of the security services for the decent role which they played during and after the November 18 presidential and parliamentary elections and which ensured continued peace in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba observed that Zambian soldiers had not only done their work at home but also abroad on United Nations peace keeping functions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba was speaking at the first graduation ceremony for officers who enrolled at the Zambian Command Staff College in Lusaka last year when it opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba assured that government will continued to support security services so that they may be able to defend the nation even better from both internal and external enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was most cheered to learn that the Defence college will next year start enrolling foreign students who will help transform it into an international institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President observed that such a move was necessary and vital to the development of the Zambian military since it will bestow international recognition on the college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Army commander, Lt-General Nobby Simbeye, reported to the President that there were 43 students who were graduating today and these had successfully completed the first ever command and staff course to be offered in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were students from the Army and the Zambia Air Force who trained in command leadership, army and air force studies as well as United Nations peace keeping duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence Minister Ben Mwila had explained to the President that the course on international peace keeping was important since Zambia now is involved in this field with soldiers having played their role in Rwanda and Mozambique before turning now to Angola where some of them are still serving.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Livingstone - GOVERNMENT says it will rehabilitate the dangerous Mulobezi rail-line ir order to provide better services to the community and also convert this facility into a tourism conduit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transport and Communications permanent secretary, Ronald Mukuma, gave the government promise in an interview during a cocktail party to mark the official launch of the Zambezi Express train.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Mulobezi was one of the liens to be rehabilitated once funds were given to his Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have budgeted for all the stretches that require repairs and Mulobezi is among them so long we are given the money we have asked for,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He observed that apart from connecting a rural farming area to urbanised Livingstone the Mulobezi line can form part of the country's routes to Namibia adding that 20 years from now it could become the lifeline to the sea though there are no plans of this nature on the drawing boards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Senior Chief Mukuni of Kalomo, who together with Chief Musokotwane sampled the new Zambezi Express train said that the Mulobezi rail-line could be very useful once transformed into a much more comfortable mode of passenger transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Zambia Railways Managing Director, Clement Mambwe, had promised to continue with the programme which had resulted in the coaches for the Zambezi Express train service to be salvaged from the scrap heap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In turn Mr Mukuma had called on the travelling public to treat the 'new' train as their own personal property if it is to in turn give them comfort and service for a much longer period.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndola - SOME Mineworkers Union of Zambia officials are on a full campaign for the position of president which was left vacant hardly a month ago by the death of Francis Kunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A MUZ supreme councillor, Gibson Lumpa, accused union general-secretary Paul Kafumbe of being among those campaigning for the post adding that this man was using union resources to win the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MUZ is expected to hold elections to choose a successor the late helmsman of the union, who died on November 17 after an illness, 'soon'.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kafumpe accused Mr Kafumpe of having ganged up with general treasurer Dan Kombe to beat acting president Ernest Mutale at the polls next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said since the two officials worked full time at the MUZ secretariat at Katilungu House it was easy for them to manipulate the campaign for the top position of the union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most worrying thing is that they are using union funds to woo support for Mr Kafumbe,&quot; he charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lumpa pointed out that the constitution of MUZ does not allow use of union funds by office holders in campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his concerns as a councillor was to ensure a level playing field for the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the union is chosen by the supreme council of the union comprising of officials from branches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lumpa accused the general secretary of using the Nchanga branch to boost his campaign and allegedly dished out millions of kwacha to secure the position and the loyalty of branch officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But workers at the MUZ secretariat who did not want to disclose their identities accused Mr Lumpa of telling lies, saying the date for the election has not even been set yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr Kafumbe and Mr Kombe were reported to be in Lusaka where they are attending an undisclosed meeting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Until the current electricity system is overhauled the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) will not be able to guarantee 100 per cent power supply to its customers, said managing director, Rabson Mwansa, yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwansa, in an interview yesterday, said ZESCO can only be liable for a customer's loss if that arose outside of the legal supply limits given to clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current electricity system was installed in the 1950s and 60s and it was time that the lines were replaced,&quot; Mwansa said. &quot;So much money is needed for this, about US$150 million and we are working with the World Bank towards this goal which will ensure improved supply.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwansa said at the time a customer applies for electricity, there is a condition of supply which states that a customer can only receive 50 cycles per second at a specific voltage, usually 230 volts, plus or minus 10 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we supply higher than that or lower than that, then we might be considered technically liable for any loss occurring to the consumer. But we also cannot be made liable for acts of God such as someone hitting into a pole or lightening in one area which also causes low or higher voltages,&quot; Mwansa said. &quot;I do sympathise with our customers but the situation of Zambia is such that it is in a wet area which is prone to lightening and power failures will occur because electricity attracts lightening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of consumers have complained of having equipment such as cookers, refrigerators, and other electric property damaged because of power cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One consumer from Lusaka West, Elizabeth Mwenda, who lost 200 day old chicks after a blackout, was furious when she was told by ZESCO that she could not be compensated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They did not give me a warning and there is no way they can say they are not liable. If they had warned me I would have made adequate arrangements for my chicks,&quot; Mwenda carped, asking: &quot; How am I expected to start making arrangements in the middle of the night?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mwansa said it was advisable for clients who were involved in risky ventures to invest in a back-up system through multiple sourcing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One can apply for two sources of supply. Some examples are places like the airport which has two sources of supply, overhead and underground system, or the University Teaching Hospital with four sources of supply lines,&quot; Mwansa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was possible to ensure uninterrupted power supply with a special back-up battery which was being used by some institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We endeavour to repair faults as soon as we can and we do compensate if it is proved that though a fault was reported and we did not show up to rectify the fault in time,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - THE Football Association of Zambia (FAZ), struggling to raise funds for next month's World Cup qualifier against South Africa, has sold the television rights of the match to the South African Broadcasting Corperation (SABC) .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources, the deal, which was struck last month, will however accommodate the coverage of the match by the Zambia National Broadcasting Cooperation (ZNBC) to enable the local population watch the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot make any comments on that because it is only the chairman, Mr Chiti, who has the powers to comment on policy issues,&quot; said FAZ acting general secretary, Julio Chiluba when asked to confirm the deal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiti, in an interview from Ndola again referred all questions to Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have some information on that but the best person to talk about it is the general secretary because it is an administrative issue,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a clause in the deal which requires any Zambian companies wishing to advertise to approach the SABC is said to have angered some local firms who have threatened to take up the issue with the ministry of sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources disclosed that the deal is better than the one FAZ signed with SABC two years ago when Zambia thrashed the Bafana Bafanas 3-0, where FAZ only got $11,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is something much better than the $11,000 deal which was signed that time, but the ministry has warned FAZ to make good use of the money from the deal,&quot; said a source who looked at the contract of the FAZ-SABC deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But SABC director, Zuuerakhe Sisule, whose firm will show the match live to South African viewers, was not in office yesterday when attempts to get his coments were made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is true that there is an agreement to show the Zambia-South Africa match but as at now, all the directors are out attending a workshop,&quot; said a secretary to the director at the SABC in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - ZAMBIA'S first disco giant, CLOUDS or the Cool Lovable Outrageous Disco Sounds in full, will over the festive period celebrate it's 20th anniversary in show-biz at Lusaka's Hotel Intercontinental pool side, the outfit's spokesman, Martin Simwaka, disclosed yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jam extravaganza will put together all sounds from CLOUDS mobile disco, through our stint at Q-Stique, Room at the Top, Hilites to the days of Valentino's and the Oasis night clubs,&quot; said Simwaka, adding: &quot;Of course, we will not forget the double jam fusion at the Chinese Great Wall and the now simple but breath- taking dine and dance shindigs at Pete's Steak House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Simwaka, the gate outlay will be announced later while plans are underway to feature all dee Jays that once spun records for CLOUDS.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are trying to get all the Dee Jays that we have worked with over the twenty years to feature during the celebration,&quot; he disclosed. &quot;We want it to be a memorable show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLOUDS was established in 1976 by former Zambia Airways aircraft engineer, Hanif Adams and his erstwhile pal, Yunous Essa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using speakers hired from Lewis Kunda, owner of the one time 70's sensation, Lord Lewis disco, the outfit was a roving ministrel, jamming wherever a good venue could be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the decade wore on, the outfit found a permanent base at the Q- Stique in Lusaka's Emmasdale residential area where it proved to be a real crowd puller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the turn of the last decade, Hanif teamed up with the late &quot;Dirty&quot; Dick Curtis and established the Room at the Top, or RATT in short on the 19th floor of Society House. The latter pulled out and the joint was re-named Hilites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a mysterious fire gutted Hilites and for sometime Hanif was in limbo.  He, however, linked up with Lusaka businessman, Humphrey Mapoma, and turned his restuarant the Breezing lounge into what became known as Valentino's or Valies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Valentino's continued to pull crowds, Hanif decided to open another night club at the former Oasis restaurant, called Pepe's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just as business was picking up, the owners decided to turn the restaurant into some Arabic eatary and Hanif was forced out. About the same time too, the owners of the building in which Valentino's was housed decided to up rent to unreasonable levels, prompting Hanif to pack up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disillussioned but not beaten, Hanif decided to move into the Chinese Great Wall restaurant where he put up double jams, catering for rhumba and disco freaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But misunderstandings with the owners forced Hanif to shift to Pete's Steak House, where CLOUDS is presently housed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feast, therefore, is a welcome diversion which should appeal to those who were there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanif, who recently returned from the United States with a sack full of musical surprises promised: &quot;If you were there, be there!&quot; Need I say more?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Lack of security and qualified marketing agents have robbed the Zambian emerald industry of its potential as a major forex earner for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emeralds in Zambia are mainly mined by small scale miners and there are about 200 operators in the Copperbelt Province alone, according to statistics from the mining ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem with emerald mining in Zambia is that we manage to get a lot more material on the black market than through formalised channels. There is no security for the miners as well in the areas where emeralds are mined.  Fifty per cent of a mine owner's production is lost to his workers while the rest is at risk from robbers during transportation,&quot; said Oliver Makungu, one of Zambia's few marketing agents in precious minerals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makungu is an agent for a number of offshore clients he refused to name and also owns a lapidary in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New mines minister Christon Tembo has instructed the police to step up security in the mining areas on the Copperbelt due to the high spate of mineral thefts in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) confirmed in a statement last Friday that it had stopped movement of copper by trucks to the South African port of Durban and would concentrate on the Northern rail routes because of the high risk of theft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Makungu, the Zambian emerald is more prevalent on the black market than the formal market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is very frustrating considering that people prefer the Zambian emerald to the Columbian emerald,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the directors of Pilala Mine on the Copperbelt, who declined to be named, said some South and West African businessmen were making a killing on Zambian emeralds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since most of us do not have the capital to invest in equipment, they offer to provide equipment in exchange for half our production. Unfortunately, the exchange is done before the stones are even valued as that is another expensive process. These people are probably given more than what they put in, &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that the efforts by individual mine owners to market their stones usually resulted in great losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What these people don't understand is that there are cartels on the European and American markets. It is better to use international agents when selling to these markets otherwise material worth US$3,000 is given away at $500 simply because people tried to do their own selling&quot; Makungu revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makungu advised that it was time the gemstone trade in Zambia was opened up to investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After all we have liberalised the economy, there is nothing wrong with setting up something similar to a stock exchange where we can find out who is selling and where gemstones can be bought,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (PANA) - The trend of corruption in Tanzania partly stems from low wages and inadequate fringe benefits which fail to satisfy workers needs, according to a recent report issued here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The over 500-page report, handed over to President Benjamin Mkapa, also blames unscrupulous businessmen who have corrupted top officials to win government tenders and favours, especially tax evasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mkapa said the report &quot;only gives scientific ways on how to deal with and eradicate corruption,&quot; the public and the media have gone further and suggested that measures should be taken against top officials cited in the report as being corrupt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, the majority of Tanzanian public servants are forced to demand bribes in order to make ends meet. This could be corrected by better incomes and wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it accuses high ranking officials with access to many facilities of resorting to corruption because &quot;they want to accumulate wealth.&quot; High ranking officials under the previous government of President Ali Hassan Mwinyi have been named as corrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the country's finance minister, Prof.Simon Mbilinyi, was recently forced to resign following an uproar in parliament over reports that he had been bribed to give tax exemptions to local businessmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, compiled by a team of nine commissioners, headed by former Prime Minister Joseph Sinde Warioba, states that the colonial era laws on corruption, which was adopted in 1958, was full of loopholes. The commission was set up in January 1996 to also review the law, regulations, procedures and the mode of operations in the government and parastatal organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the report, whose compilation took 11 months, notes that the public institutions set to wipe out corruption, including the judiciary, were corrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The public, because they need services, are forced to give out bribes but they don't like it,&quot; says part of the report, quoted by the Tanzanian News Agency (SHIHATA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministries and departments singled out in the report as being corrupt include those of education, health, home affairs, treasury, judiciary, attorney general's chambers, trade and industry, lands, natural resources, tourism and public works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report has not spare the media either, which should, in principle, help in exposing corruption. In two lines, it affirms that the Tanzanian media have been infested with &quot;cheque-book journalists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To clamp out corruption, the president has to summon reports of all top officials tarnished by corruption and all top government official should declare their property,&quot; the report suggests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - A former Zambian vice-president in Kenneth Kaunda's government, Maiza Chona, on charges of &quot;falsely alarming the public&quot;, was acquitted Friday by a Lusaka magistrate because he had &quot;no case to answer&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was charged after issuing a statement in the supreme court on Nov. 14 that &quot;a bomb had been planted at former President Kaunda's residence in Lusaka.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chona had made the statement before a full supreme court bench which was then hearing a petition filed by opposition parties challenging President Frederick Chiluba's citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former vice-president, who is a lawyer, claimed that two of the witnesses they intended to call to challenge Chiluba's citizenship had received parcel bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was summoned to court Tuesday to answer the charges. His lawyers, however, argued that there was no way Chona should be summoned to court when he had not been formally arrested and charged with the offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Principal Resident Magistrate Francis Nsokolo said in his ruling that the reasons for issuing the summons to Chona were wrong as well as the procedure that was used by the state in order to secure his attendance of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I dismiss the charge against the accussed person,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SINGAPORE, (PANA) - The just-ended World Trade Organisation (WTO) conference in Singapore has delivered a win-win outcome for developing countries which in the past five days resisted Western attempts to link labour standards with trade privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Led by the United States, industrialised member countries of the WTO had demanded that core labour standards be put on the WTO agenda, which would have for the first time put the WTO in direct confrontation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But over 120 speakers who presented speeches at the conference were unanimous that labour issues were not in the realm of the WTO and should instead be discussed within the ILO.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe and other member countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) also took a strong stance against the issue, saying it could cause unnecessary confrontation among member states and cloud the vision of the WTO in its quest to liberalise global trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US and the European Union countries found themselves fighting a losing battle, with developing member countries of the WTO accusing the West of trying to impose their rules on weaker nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the closing ceremony WTO ministerial conference chairman, Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister Yoo Cheow Tong, emphasised that labour issues were best dealt with by the Geneva-based ILO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the ministerial declaration recognised that the ILO was the competent body to set and deal with labour standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It rejected the use of labour for protectionist purposes which he said was very important for safeguarding the multilateral trading system, particularly for developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said ministers had also agreed that the comparative advantage of low- wage countries &quot;must in no way be put into question (and) does not inscribe the relationship between trade and core labour standards on the WTO agenda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheow emphasised the WTO would not undertake further work on the relationship between trade and labour standards, implying the subject was unlikely to be raised at future WTO meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the meeting, the first to be held since ministers signed the WTO agreement in Marrakech, Morocco in April 1994, has been hailed by delegates as an important milestone in laying the foundation for future co-operation between the rich and poor countries in removing tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade and investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The conference has provided a strong political message underlining opportunities in the new global economy, while ignoring the challenges that our economies face,&quot; the Singapore trade minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The message this conference has sent is one of confidence in the multilateral trading system as it approaches its 50th anniversary in 1998 and in its ability to promote growth and guarantee stability,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also expected to benefit from the outcome of the conference would be the so- called least developed countries, which many delegates said were in the danger of being permanently left behind as the rest of the world moved towards global economic integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their declaration, the ministers pledged to provide more technical assistance to ensure that the countries, ranging from Afghanistan to Zambia, successfully implemented Uruguay Round commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richer countries would explore ways of granting preferential duty-free access for the exports of least developed countries, particularly for clothing and textiles.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Gold production by the Ashanti Goldfields Company (AGC) at the Obuasi mine fell slightly in the last 12 months ending Sept. 30, 1996, as compared to the same period in 1995, the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995 gold production stood at 932,323 ounces, while that for 1996 dropped to 883,853 ounces. The company had earlier projected that production will hit the one million ounces mark.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Sam E. Jonah, chief executive of AGC, the low gold production reflected the drop in production from the surface mines as well as the treatment of larger tonnages of ore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shift in emphasis from the surface to higher grade underground ore has been initiated and continues to be the focus of the new management,&quot; he said in Accra Thursday in an interim report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, said &quot;1996 has been a milestone year for the company, a year in which it has been transformed from a gold producer with a single mine in Ghana to a group with several operating mines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company now has &quot;major development projects and an exploration portfolio that includes land positions on each of the most promising gold mineralisation belts of sub-Saharan Africa,&quot; Jonah added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It moved rapidly in the last six months to add value to the former Cluff properties that were acquired in January, increased exploration and development at Freda-Rebbecca in Zimbabwe leading to a 17 percent increase in reserves and eight percent increase in gold production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the company's earnings in 1996, the report shows it earned 70.9 million U.S. dollars representing 33 percent lower than the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Earnings were depressed, particularly in the last six months by the high operation costs of the Obuasi mine which is focusing on surface mining operations,&quot; it adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next five years will see the company seeking to transform the underground mine into a bulk tonnage and mechanised mining operation that will double ore production to 3.5 million tonnes a year, the report notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company made a profit of 71.4 million dollars as against 105.8 million dollars for 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashanti's shares are currently listed on the Australian Stock Exchange which adds up to its existing listings in Accra, Harare, London, New York and Toronto.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian opposition parties have been told that their petition against President Frederick Chiluba's victory in last month's elections can only be heard if they pay the equivalent of 49,000 US dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pre-condition has been spelled out to the four political parties that lodged their petition in the Zambian Supreme Court on Nov.29, challenging Chiluba's eligibility to stand for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The payment demand has been made by the country's solicitor general, Sam Chisulo, as a condition for the petition's hearing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition parties want the Supreme Court to probe chiluba's nationality, in accordance with the new constitution, which requires that only citizens whose parents were also born in country qualify to run for the office of president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition parties charged that Chiluba lied about his nationality when he filed electoral nomination papers last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioning parties are the United National Independence Party (UNIP) of former President Kenneth Kaunda, the Liberal Progressive Front, the National Congress and Agenda for Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State senior counsel, Mainza Chona, who is one of the lawyers for the petitioners confirmed to PANA Friday that he had received a letter from Chisulo informing him about the costs being asked before the hearing takes place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The solicitor general is demanding 49 million kwacha from us. I think the fee is wild and exorbitant,&quot; Chona said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solicitor general's demand has been described as &quot;wild and outrageous&quot; by some political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal Progressive Front chairman, Rodger Chongwe, said that the fee was exorbitant for an appearance in court. He claimed that the objective was to frustrate Zambians so that Chiluba's nomination was not challenged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chisulo should not kill these proceedings by demanding an outrageous sum of money. It is a cheap ploy to kill the petition that no government employee should engage in,&quot; Zambia Democratic Congress deputy secretary Azwell Banda charged, adding that the demands were political and unprofessional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week before the Nov. 18 polls, the four parties filed a petition asking the court to order postponement of the elections until the question of Chiluba's nationality was resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That petition was dismissed after the court ruled that it was premature and contrary to the provisions of the electoral law, which requires that a petition be filed within 14 days after the new president has been sworn-in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four parties then filed a fresh petition after the elections on Nov.29.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - The Organization of African Unity (OAU) Friday said Africa was unable to act in the crisis in eastern Zaire due to the failure of the international community to provide it with effective means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa has had to stand by and watch the unfolding of yet another crisis which at one time threatened to have a possible humanitarian catastrophe,&quot; the organisation's secretary general, Salim Ahmed Salim, said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attrbitued this to &quot;a combination of developments in eastern Zaire itself and the inability of the international community to take speedy and timely action to help stabilize the situation&quot; despite the commitment made by the leaders of the Greater Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim was opening a seminar on peace-making and peace-keeping for the OAU staff, organized by the New York-based International Peace Academy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nine-day seminar, which will provide advance training for senior OAU staff involved in conflict prevention, management and resolution, is co- sponsored by the OAU with the support of the government of Denmark, whose minister for development cooperation is also participating.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United Nations (PANA) - The outgoing United Nations Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Friday congratulated his successor, Kofi Annan of Ghana, who is billed to take over as head of the organization on Jan.  1, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botros-Ghali's spokeswoman, Sylvana Foa, said &quot;the Secretary-General has worked closely with Mr. Annan through these past five years and wishes him every success.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that Boutros-Ghali was pleased that the decision to appoint annan was unanimous &quot;and is especially gratified that Africa has been able to maintain the office of Secretary-General for a second five-year term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foa said that getting an African to serve a second term had been the objective of the secretary-general &quot;throughout these recent months&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokeswoman also expressed the secretary-general-general's &quot;deepest thanks&quot; for the support and encouragement given to him during his tenure by the member states and peoples of the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what is generally regarded as a mere formality, the 185-member UN General Assembly is expected to elect Annan on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US, saying that Boutros-Ghali has not carried out enough reform at the UN, vetoed a second term for the Egyptian on Nov. 19, although he received the support of all the other members of the 15 members of the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Dec. 4, the 74-years-old Egyptian diplomat &quot;suspended&quot; his candidature, paving the way for four African candidates --Annan, Amara Essy of Cote d'Ivoire, Hamid Algabid of Niger and Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania -- to enter the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council members agreed to give priority to African candidates to give the continent a chance at a second mandate, in accordance with an informal tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boutros-Ghali, the first African to head the UN, will serve out his current term on Dec. 31.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was said here Saturday by the Vice-Chancellor of the Zimbabwe-based Africa University, Bishop Emilio De Carvalho, when he addressed hundreds of people gathered to witness the institution's second graduation ceremony since its establishment in 1992.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Carvalho appealed to African governments and private institutions to ensure university graduates from the continent found decent jobs so they could contribute to the development of their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said ignorance, under-development, poverty, illiteracy and paucity of skills and resources were still the major constraints affecting the enjoyment of prosperity for the majority of African people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The greatest problem with our continent is not so much the lack of qualified educated citizens, it is indeed the lack of profiting from the thousands of national graduands who leave schools and universities each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa stands at the crossroads, either we stand firm and decide to raise our own people from the ashes of ignorance and poverty or we are going to continue to deviate our attention and action, making us to develop peoples and nations other than our own,&quot; said Carvalho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed the need for African governments to empower students in their respective countries with relevant values and skills that would ensure self- dependency through provision of educational opportunities to all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishop was speaking at a colourful graduation ceremony for 21 students from Angola, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, who received degrees in agriculture and natural resources and divinity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United Nations (PANA) - The United Nations Secretary-General- elect, Kofi Annan of Ghana, says his priority will be to redefine the organization's objectives in the post cold-war era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement Friday after the security council voted unanimously to recommend him to the UN General Assembly as the seventh UN Secretary-General, Annan said: &quot;it is time to agree on what the UN can and must do, and what it cannot do.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those choices will require consensus and cooperation amongst all member states,&quot; said Annan, whose appointment is expected to be ratified by the 185- member assembly next Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the collective will and combined resources of the member states, &quot;their vision of what we will strive to achieve together&quot;, would determine the effectiveness of the UN in the years ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan called for &quot;a time of healing&quot; to restore confidence between governments and the UN to help replenish its financial strength and its political and moral authority, rebuild its sense of common purpose and maintain its trust and cooperation among the peoples of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pledged to sustain the morale, motivation and performance of the UN staff members, whom he called the organisation's greatest assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I accept with humility, and also with determination, my nomination by the security council,&quot; the 58-year-old Ghanaian said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the General Assembly acts favourably on the recommendation of the Security Council, I shall dedicate myself to pursuing these objectives, to which I have devoted most of my life, with vigour and full commitment,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - The European Union is to provide 150,000 US dollars to finance a consumer education project in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project, to be carried out by Proconsumer, the country's recently founded consumers' defence association, will be advised by the Portuguese National Consumer Defence Institute (INDC).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDC's deputy chairman, Joaquim Carapico, who has been in Mozambique since Monday at the invitation of Proconsumers told a press conference Saturday that it was up to Mozambicans to set up their own model of consumer protection, in accordance with the specific realities of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed the need for civil society to educate ordinary citizens on their rights as consumers. Such education should start early, he said, &quot;when consumers are still children, in school, and in everything concerning their life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carapico said that the passing of a legislation defending consumers would be a significant step in helping citizens understand their rights and duties in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the chairman of Proconsumer, Francisco Lichuca, the consumer education project seeks to make citizens aware of their rights and persuade businesses to comply with their obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next Tuesday, the mozambican parliament's chairman, Eduardo Mulembue will grant an audience to the leaders of Proconsumer and of other Southern African consumers' defence associations, who are attending a conference in Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the matters to be discussed during the audience include propspects for law on consumer protection and the recent importation of 13,000 tonnes of wheat flour, contaminated with the banned additive potassium bromate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flour was imported from Belgium by the Mozambique international trading company.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Bureau For Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), Great Lakes Update, Fact Sheet No. 4 -- December 13, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania: The situation in the Tanzania refugee camps is evolving rapidly and confirmed information is sketchy. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that on December 12, Rwandan refugees began to pour out of the Ngara refugee camps in Western Tanzania and most camps are now partially or completely emptied. This includes Benaco camp, which previously held 150, 000 and Lumasi camp, which previously held 113,000. Most refugees started to move east, but some were blocked by Tanzanian military troops. Those intercepted by Tanzanian forces turned around and headed back towards the camps, and possibly towards the border with Rwanda. UNHCR has stated that the Ngara camps will not be reconstituted. Oxfam and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have established water stations every five kms along the main route from Ngara to the Rwandan border. It is unclear how many refugees passed the Tanzanian blockade and are still headed east.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All refugees have a two week supply of food and are in good condition, as there was low malnutrition in the camps, most refugees have been vaccinated and they are carrying shelter materials with them. The availability of water and health services east of Ngara is unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also from the Ngara region, UNHCR reports that about 35,000 from Kitali, Lukole, Keza and Mushuhuru camps are reportedly heading south, possibly towards Zambia and/or Malawi. If indeed they are heading that way, the refugees will first reach the Kibondo, Kasulu and Kigoma camps where UNHCR is currently assisting an estimated 230,000 Burundian and 36,000 Zairian refugees, along with about 1,200 Rwandan refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR also reported that on December 7-8, about 23,000 Rwandan refugees from the Kagenya and Rubwero camps in the Karagwe area of Tanzania, north of Ngara, dispersed to avoid repatriation. UNHCR located several groups of these refugees and persuaded about 4,000 to return to the camps for later repatriation to Rwanda. There are some reports of additional movements out of the Karagwe region camps, but no numbers have been provided. Food distributions were scheduled to occur in the Karagwe camps today, which may trigger refugee movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a total of 530,000 Rwandan refugees in Tanzania and an additional 5,000 have returned to Rwanda since September. The Government of Tanzania has called for the repatriation of all Rwandan refugees by December 31 but has declared that no forced repatriation would occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda: The main route from the Ngara area camps to Rwanda is north west, via the Rusumo crossing into Kibungo Prefecture in Rwanda. A USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) representative and a Food for Peace officer watched an estimated 1,800 Rwandan refugees cross into Rwanda on December 13 aboard 11 Tanzanian Red Crescent trucks, via the Rusumo crossing. UNHCR and NGOs have been focusing their preparedness efforts on the Rusumo-Rwamagana corridor and are accelerating their efforts to prepare for a mass return, which, given current population movements, could begin as early as tomorrow.  Following a December 4, meeting in Kibungo involving Government of Rwanda (GOR), UNHCR, NGO and DART representatives, NGOs began to establish water points, health posts and biscuit distributions along the route from the Rusumo border crossing to Rwanteru, 18 kms inside the border; from Kirehe (located 25 kms inside the border) to Remera (located 68 kms inside the border); and from Kabarondo (located 76 kms inside the border) to Rwamagana (located 107 kms inside the border.) An NGO has been designated the lead agency along each corridor. USAID/DART reports that, as of December 13, sufficient water, health and biscuit distributions points were in place. A USAID/DART representative will deploy to Kibungo tomorrow.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Tanzanian troops are surrounding groups of the more than 300,000 Rwandan refugees who left their camps in the Ngara area on Thursday and seeking to prevent them from dispersing, according to media reports. Aid agencies and journalists are not being allowed access to these areas, fuelling speculation that the troops will make a concerted effort to encourage refugees to return to Rwanda. To date there have been no reports of the use of force by Tanzanian soldiers, but the authorities have reiterated that the 31 December deadline remains in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, WFP reports that a group of over 100,000 refugees in the Kitale-Keza area to the south of Ngara, are moving in an easterly direction into the interior of Tanzania. The group is reported to have formed a column 20 kms long. It is unclear whether there are troops present in the area and whether the movement of refugees to the east will be blocked.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Tanzanian troops allowed refugees, who had left Benaco, Lumasi and Musuhura camps on Thursday afternoon, but who had begun to make their way back to the camps, to rest. Later, the troops issued orders that the refugees had to continue on to the Rwandan border. It appears, however, that the army's attempts to prevent refugees from returning to their camps were largely unsuccessful. Yesterday UNHCR was expecting tens of thousands of refugees to be at the Rwandan border by nightfall, but reporters at the border this afternoon say there are no signs of large numbers of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 2,500 refugees joined UNHCR's repatriation convoys back to Rwanda yesterday, the largest in a single day so far. Since the beginning of December, 5,261 refugees have returned to Rwanda voluntarily; this compares to a total number of 3,279 voluntary returnees between 1 January and 30 November this year. At the same time, 7,000 of the 23,000 refugees who had fled their camps in the Karagwe area were reported to have gone back to their camps, while about 500 arrived in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nearest crossing point into Rwanda is about 20 kms north west of Ngara at Rusumo. The ICRC, IFRC and Oxfam have established health, meeting and water points every five kms along this main route to the border, while aid agencies are also scaling up their activities within Rwanda. They are reported to have established water points, health posts and biscuit distributions along a 100 km route from the Rusumo border crossing to Rwanteru, Kirehe, Remera, Kabarondo and Rwamagana in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire's Interior Minister, Kamanda wa Kamanda, said yesterday that Zaire does not recognize a ceasefire called by rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces in eastern Zaire. Speaking to Reuters, Mr Kamanda said, 'We do not recognise this ceasefire. In this war we believe that the other side is the Government of Rwanda and those who are supporting Rwanda so we shall do everything in our means to recover lost territory.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, heads of state and government from Great Lakes countries will meet in Nairobi to discuss the situation in eastern Zaire. The Secretary General of the OAU, Salim Ahmed Salim, will attend, as will Julius Nyerere, founding president of Tanzania and currently mediator for the peace talks on Burundi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botros-Ghali's spokeswoman, Sylvana Foa, said &quot;the Secretary-General has worked closely with Mr. Annan through these past five years and wishes him every success.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that Boutros-Ghali was pleased that the decision to appoint annan was unanimous &quot;and is especially gratified that Africa has been able to maintain the office of Secretary-General for a second five-year term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foa said that getting an African to serve a second term had been the objective of the secretary-general &quot;throughout these recent months&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokeswoman also expressed the secretary-general-general's &quot;deepest thanks&quot; for the support and encouragement given to him during his tenure by the member states and peoples of the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what is generally regarded as a mere formality, the 185-member UN General Assembly is expected to elect Annan on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US, saying that Boutros-Ghali has not carried out enough reform at the UN, vetoed a second term for the Egyptian on Nov. 19, although he received the support of all the other members of the 15 members of the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Dec. 4, the 74-years-old Egyptian diplomat &quot;suspended&quot; his candidature, paving the way for four African candidates --Annan, Amara Essy of Cote d'Ivoire, Hamid Algabid of Niger and Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania -- to enter the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council members agreed to give priority to African candidates to give the continent a chance at a second mandate, in accordance with an informal tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boutros-Ghali, the first African to head the UN, will serve out his current term on Dec. 31.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was said here Saturday by the Vice-Chancellor of the Zimbabwe-based Africa University, Bishop Emilio De Carvalho, when he addressed hundreds of people gathered to witness the institution's second graduation ceremony since its establishment in 1992.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Carvalho appealed to African governments and private institutions to ensure university graduates from the continent found decent jobs so they could contribute to the development of their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said ignorance, under-development, poverty, illiteracy and paucity of skills and resources were still the major constraints affecting the enjoyment of prosperity for the majority of African people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The greatest problem with our continent is not so much the lack of qualified educated citizens, it is indeed the lack of profiting from the thousands of national graduands who leave schools and universities each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa stands at the crossroads, either we stand firm and decide to raise our own people from the ashes of ignorance and poverty or we are going to continue to deviate our attention and action, making us to develop peoples and nations other than our own,&quot; said Carvalho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed the need for African governments to empower students in their respective countries with relevant values and skills that would ensure self- dependency through provision of educational opportunities to all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishop was speaking at a colourful graduation ceremony for 21 students from Angola, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, who received degrees in agriculture and natural resources and divinity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United Nations (PANA) - The United Nations Secretary-General- elect, Kofi Annan of Ghana, says his priority will be to redefine the organization's objectives in the post cold-war era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement Friday after the security council voted unanimously to recommend him to the UN General Assembly as the seventh UN Secretary-General, Annan said: &quot;it is time to agree on what the UN can and must do, and what it cannot do.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those choices will require consensus and cooperation amongst all member states,&quot; said Annan, whose appointment is expected to be ratified by the 185- member assembly next Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the collective will and combined resources of the member states, &quot;their vision of what we will strive to achieve together&quot;, would determine the effectiveness of the UN in the years ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan called for &quot;a time of healing&quot; to restore confidence between governments and the UN to help replenish its financial strength and its political and moral authority, rebuild its sense of common purpose and maintain its trust and cooperation among the peoples of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pledged to sustain the morale, motivation and performance of the UN staff members, whom he called the organisation's greatest assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I accept with humility, and also with determination, my nomination by the security council,&quot; the 58-year-old Ghanaian said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the General Assembly acts favourably on the recommendation of the Security Council, I shall dedicate myself to pursuing these objectives, to which I have devoted most of my life, with vigour and full commitment,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - The European Union is to provide 150,000 US dollars to finance a consumer education project in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project, to be carried out by Proconsumer, the country's recently founded consumers' defence association, will be advised by the Portuguese National Consumer Defence Institute (INDC).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDC's deputy chairman, Joaquim Carapico, who has been in Mozambique since Monday at the invitation of Proconsumers told a press conference Saturday that it was up to Mozambicans to set up their own model of consumer protection, in accordance with the specific realities of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed the need for civil society to educate ordinary citizens on their rights as consumers. Such education should start early, he said, &quot;when consumers are still children, in school, and in everything concerning their life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carapico said that the passing of a legislation defending consumers would be a significant step in helping citizens understand their rights and duties in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the chairman of Proconsumer, Francisco Lichuca, the consumer education project seeks to make citizens aware of their rights and persuade businesses to comply with their obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next Tuesday, the mozambican parliament's chairman, Eduardo Mulembue will grant an audience to the leaders of Proconsumer and of other Southern African consumers' defence associations, who are attending a conference in Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the matters to be discussed during the audience include propspects for law on consumer protection and the recent importation of 13,000 tonnes of wheat flour, contaminated with the banned additive potassium bromate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flour was imported from Belgium by the Mozambique international trading company.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17.10.96 Germany: Parliamentary debate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A parliamentary motion of the German deputy E.Brecht (SPD), who directed the German parliamentary mission in W.S. in April 1996, asks to the government to intensify its initiatives, particularly inside the European Union and the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, in order to move on the implementation of the peace plan in W.S.. In his answer the Minister of Foreign Affairs declares that the government shares the concerns expressed by the motion. The German Government has sustained the efforts of the UN in order to restart the peace process. In its mind the UN have still to play a central role for the solution of this conflict. It will work in the Security Council in favour of the maintain of the MINURSO. A total withdrawal would be dangerous. War could start again. The German government will work for the continuing and intensifying of the efforts of the UN. It will maintain its strict neutrality, its contacts with both parties and favor the direct dialogue. In its mind the problem of the POWs must be resolved urgently for humanitarian reasons, in the frame of the UN peace plan. ( 66 POWs have been released meanwhile)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answering to a question the German government declaredthat the humanitarian support of Germany for the years 1988 to 1996, mainly food for the refugee camps near Tindouf, amounts more than 6 millions $.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">05.12.96 Autonomy or independance ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmad Alaoui, councelor of King Hassan II declares that the King offers the regional autonomy of the territory of Western Sahara to the Polisario Front, in condition of its renouncement of total independence. This proposal was already discussed in occasion of the contacts between Moroco and the Polisario Front last September and is connected with the Moroccan project of regionalization which divides the kingdom in 16 provinces with economical, social and cultural autonomy. A Polisario representative in Madrid rejects the Moroccan offer, saying his organisation is fighting for independence and a referendum has to take place. (El Pais)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10.12.96 Eastern Timor - Western Sahara</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In occasion of the attribution of the Nobel Peace Prize to him and to bishop X. Belo, Mr. Ramos-Horta, spokesman of the Resistance in Eastern Timor, said: &quot;In the process of decolonization of non-autonomous territories, self- determination allowed nearly always the independence of those territories.  But it is not the case in the majority of the conflicts remaining today. The case of Western Sahara and Eastern Timor are two examples. In the case of W.S.  the UN make themselves accomplice of a minor regional power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10.12.96 Human Rights in Morocco</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to OMDH ( Organisation Marocaine des Droits de l'Homme) the human rights situation has worried in 1996 after 3 years of improvement. In a declaration of 32 pages a lot of violations of human rights are listened. The Moroccan H.R. organisation announces a 3 month campaign against torture used by the security forces. An other Moroccan H.R. organisation, AMDH (Association Marocaine des Droits de l'Homme), numbered 9 individuals died in 1996 after torture and illtreatment in the police stations, 57 &quot;disappeared&quot; and 70 persons still jailed as political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10.12.96 Fishing agreement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morocco will not renew its fishing agreement with the European Union (concluded in december 1995 for 4 years) for ecological but nor political reasons. The Moroccan government just signed a cooperation agreement with the United States in which it commits itself to protect marine wealth in return of support for the renewal of its fishing fleet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome - RWANDA: Some 105,000 Rwandan refugees returned from Tanzania on 16 December. The cumulative number from 14 to 16 December is estimated at 143, 500. The majority of those returning in the past few days is coming from the Ngara camps however some 20 trucks loaded with returnees from the Karagwe camps arrived at the Rusumo border point yesterday. These returnees subsequently repatriated to Rwanda. The refugee inflow is continuing today at the same rate as yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All returnees are entering Rwanda at Rusumo (Kibungo) with most walking the first 20 km to Rwenteru. Some vulnerable refugees are receiving transportation from the border point from IFRC/RRC, which was the only organisation yesterday allowed to enter the area 20 km from the border. From Rwenteru, those returnees who originate from Byumba prefecture are being transported to their prefecture while the majority, who originate from Kibungo prefecture, continue to walk to their home communes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP distributed high-energy biscuits to 40,000 returnees (12 mt) yesterday from two distribution points between Nyakarambi and Curazo on the way to Kibungo town. Today, WFP is distributing high-energy biscuits from Kibehe located 4 km from Nyakarambi towards Kibungo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WFP Umutara sub-office has provided 3 mt (10,000 daily rations) of high- energy biscuits to the NGO, ARC, for distribution to returnees walking along the road between Kayonza and Murambi. An additional 198 mt of mixed commodities is being sent to the communes in Umutara today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP is planning on commencing weekly food distributions to repatriates in the Rusumo commune of Kibungo, from where some 100,000 returnees originate from the 105,000 who have repatriated thus far. These distributions are expected to begin as soon as today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While monitoring the nutritional situation, WFP plans to cut food rations by 70 per cent after the first month of assistance. WFP aims to prevent dependency on external food assistance and encourage the returnees to become self-sufficient. WFP will assist with reintegration through food-for-work programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 13 to 16 December, WFP and NGO partners (ADRA, AEF, AHA, ASS, CARE, Caritas, Concern, CRR, CRS, EER, GAA, IFRC, Ingabo, IRC, LWF, MEC, MSF, Red Barnet, Salvation Army, Trocaire, World Vision and World Relief) distributed approximately 150 mt of food commodities to the communes (cereals, pulses and oil). This represents 8,952 persons assisted with a monthly ration. The cumulative total since 16 November now stands at 10,759 mt (644,251 monthly rations).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZAIRE: A UN mission, including WFP, to the Lobutu area came back to Kisangani yesterday and estimated that there were approximately 120,000 refugees and internally-displaced persons (IDPs) in the Lobutu area. Refugees originate from camps in the Bukavu and Goma regions. More refugees are still on the road with reports that the number could increase to 150,000 by the end of this week. The adults appear to be in satisfactory condition however the children seem affected by the first signs of malnutrition and present the symptoms of severe dehydration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP is planning on airlifting into Kisangani 120 mt of food items (including 20 mt of biscuits) using a Zairian transporter (Boeing 707). The transportation of food onwards to Lubutu/Tingi Tingi, to assist the estimated 120,000 refugees and IDPs, will be carried out in collaboration with La Procure (the logistics service branch of the Catholic Church) with vehicles and/or using available small aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Coordination Committee has been established in Kisangani to coordinate relief assistance to the affected population. Today the first meeting is planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A DHA/WFP/UNICEF mission to Kisangani, Lubutu and Shabunda out of Kinshasa is scheduled for tomorrow, 18 December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UGANDA: 2,400 Rwandan refugees, coming from the Karagwe region in Tanzania, have been registered in Orutshinga, Uganda. WFP carried out an assessment mission to the affected area on 16 December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">200 Zairian refugees arrived in Nebbi, in northwest Uganda. More could be expected to arrive in the event of a further advance north of the Banyamulenge/Alliance rebels in Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - If anyone had any misgivings about the decision of the Sokoto State administrator to set up a State Intelligence Committee, such misgivings must have been vanquished by the tragedy that befell the people of Gwadabawa local government area of the state two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local government area has been thrown into mourning by a clash between farmers and cattle rearers which left seven people dead and over 10 others injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clash, according to investigations, was triggered by a major misunderstanding between farmers and Tuaga Zaki village and some pastoralists over the clearance of remnants of animal feed in a farmland by the latter. A passerby attracted by the exchange of words intervened in an attempt to amicably resolve the issue. The peacemaker was yet to achieve result when the tale bearers rushed to town with incorrect versions of what was happening.  While some claimed that some farmers had descended on innocent Fulani cattle rearers, others said that it was the troublesome cattle rearers who were attempting to strangle the farmers. With relations between both parties already strained by past misunderstandings arising from inadequate grazing land and the absence of clearly demarcated cattle routes, the result was a free-for-all fight in which dangerous weapons were freely used.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the state government made spirited efforts to reassure the injured farmers, who were complaining bitterly that they taken to the hospital only to be abandoned there, and that the Fulani cattle rearers have been allowed to go scot-free, instead of being punished to prevent future occurrence of such tragic clashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dismissing the allegations, Rasheed Raji, the state military administrator, told newsmen that the fight between the farmers and the cattle rearers took place at night and that by the time the news reached the police the next day, the pastoralists had vanished. He explained that although he was away in Abuja when the clash took place, the secretary to the state government, in the company of some other top government officials, visited the village with the police and the state security service when government house got information about the unfortunate incident. Raji said that the injured persons &quot;were taken to the hospital and materials were given to them as assistance from the state government,&quot; adding: &quot;For anybody to come and tell you that we have abandoned them is very wrong and very, very unfair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state administrator stressed the need for dialogue in settling problems between farmers and cattle rearers, adding that the solution does not lie in taking up arms at the least provocation. &quot;All we need to do, &quot; he said, &quot;is to dialogue with them (the pastoralist). If we keep on fighting, we continue to lose people, but we can dialogue. When they come, show them their routes.  If we can dialogue, since we know it's an annual event, I think the problem will be reduced if not eliminated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raji recalled that it was his administration's desire to find a lasting solution to the problem that informed its decision to establish the State Intelligence Committee. The committee, inaugurated November 21, is headed by the secretary to the state government, with the directors-general for agriculture, establishments, local government affairs, health and education as members. Other members are representatives of the army, police, SSS, Customs, Prisons, Immigration, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency and Federal Road Safety Commission . The committee is among other things, to look into farmers/pastoralist relations, land disputes with a view to advising the State Security Council on the best way to tackle such problems.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - It was an elated Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, Sierra Leonean president, who declared some days ago that the real enemy of his country is now hunger and poverty. The president's pronouncement stemmed from the peace accord signed November 30 in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, between his government and the rebel group, the United Revolutionary Front, hopefully closing a chapter that opened when Foday Sankoh, a former army corporal, led a group of armed men in March 1991 to launch an attack on the hitherto placid West African Country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then an estimated 10,000 civilians have been killed while half of the population have fled the country. Last two weeks peace talks which signified an end to one of Africa's most brutal civil wars were hosted by Henri Konan Bedie, the Ivorien president, who had earlier in the year over similar talks.  Sources close to the talks indicated that the &quot;perseverance&quot; of Bedie was the catalyst for reaching a compromise, as the conference was almost marred by differences over the wording of the peace agreement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the signing of the pact, the Kabbah administration has achieved a feat which eluded his three immediate predecessors in office. Joseph Momoh, whose ouster was sought by the rebel group, handled the situation with kid's glove.  His successor, Valentine Strasser, inherited the conflict, with all his efforts to contain it proving futile. It was a frustrated Strasser who openly criticised leaders of ECOWAS member nations at the organisation's summit in 1993 for leaving Sierra Leone in the cold while doing a lot for the neighboring Liberia. Following Strasser's removal from power in January this year, Julius Maada Bio, the new leader, brokered peace talks with the rebels in February at the height of preparations for the multi-party elections held next month. The talks attended by international observers including representatives of the UN, OAU and Commonwealth of Nations, were marked by smiles, handshakes and a communal prayer. This two factions found one common ground: the discontinuation of the electoral process as a way of laying a better foundation for the future of democracy in the country, founded by British humanitarians in 1787. The agreement was, however, of no effect, as local and international pressure sustained the transition to civil rule programme which subsequently brought Kabbah to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On assumption of power in March, the administration of Kabbah initiated new peace talks, expressing optimism that the rebels would lay down their arms before the end of the year. Although one of such talks was suspended in May by Kabbah on the basis of minor disagreements, his government remained committed to restoring peace to the troubled country. Amidst feelings of disappointment occasioned by the suspension of the talks, Nath Wellington, economic and development minister, told the newsmen that &quot;differences have been narrowed to the extent that we are poised for the signature of a formal peace agreement anytime from now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of sporadic violence in the last few months, the government was encouraged to end the war by certain positive developments, notably the release of captives and the surrendering of some of the rebels. In response to Kabbah's ultimatum to the rebels to lay down arms by December 1 or &quot;face the military option,&quot; no fewer than 750 members of the United Revolutionary Front in various parts of the country gave themselves up at the Sierra Leonean embassy in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, last month. Earlier, about 600 hostages held since the outbreak of the war five years ago were freed, while another 200 civilians, including women and children, regained their freedom after being held captive for two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if showing signs of exhaustion, Sankoh in October urged the OAU to once again intervene in the crisis, a development which may have given rise to the generous offer to the rebel who, last month, was allowed to return to his jungle base in Sierra Leone to consult his guerrillas on the stalled peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts, however, caution that the time has not come for the real celebration. Their reason: It may yet be a pyrrhic victory for the Kabbah administration, which is sure to face an upsurge in crime, an unfortunate development usually associated with postwar periods.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - As the 21st century inches closer, the various sectors of the Nigerian economy are undergoing a great overhaul to meet the demands of what is expected to be a more sophisticated market place. Old and boring ways of doing business are fast being discarded. New business cultures tailored to meet the taste of the no-nonsense and impatient foreign investors that increasingly trooping to &quot;virgin&quot; Nigeria, have become the in-thing.  Bureaucratic bottlenecks are being hacked to the barest minimum in an economy notorious for redtapism. New technologies - by Nigerian standards - are making speedy service delivery a pleasant surprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere else are these &quot;alien&quot; ways of conducting business as pronounced as in the banking industry. The spectre of distress notwithstanding, banks are increasing reforms in the economy, internationalising the system is only a question of time and that for banks to play their pivotal roles as investment catalysts, they too must learn the ways of their better-run international cousins. Besides, fierce but healthy competition is expected to be the cutting edge in Nigeria's banking environment in the 21st century.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was these considerations that moved the egg heads at the six-year-old Liberty Merchant Bank, arguably one of Nigeria's three most profitable merchant banks, to assemble at the Training and Conference Centre, Ogere, Ogun State, in October to brainstorm over the bank's future. The &quot;Ogere Retreat&quot; was to give birth to the bank's Three-Year Medium-Term Visioning Process running through April 1997 to the dawn of the year 2000. Liberty's managers hope that by March 2000 when the process might have run its course, the bank would have attracted happy, loyal customers who would see the bank as their natural choice, thus enabling it to achieve a balance sheet would be 2.5 times its prevailing N3.8 billion ; a pre-tax profit N1.5 billion; a five- branched bank, (two more than the current three); ;as well as a highly contented and skilled workforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To achieve these, says Paul Kokoricha, the bank's assistant general manager, management information systems, Liberty intends to invest in relevant technologies &quot;that will support our staff, make us respond to customers faster and not make us suffer competition disadvantage.&quot; In the first year of its &quot;rolling plan,&quot; the bank intends to give its customers remote access to their systems, thus ensuring that customers gain access to their accounts from their offices or homes. Electronic mail is to be introduced in the second year, while fully automated electronic banking would come on stream by 2000, making it possible for a linkage of all its branches via satellite.  This will, of course, not come cheap; Liberty hopes to invest between N20 million and n26 million on new technologies in the first year alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most ambitious bank in the area of new technologies is the United Bank for Africa. The bank is going the whole hog of floating a subsidiary banking technology company, a satellite telecommunication system that will ensure that the bank's services are rendered on-line in all its 202 branches nationwide. Ogie Eboigbe,UBA's corporate affairs manager, told that Sani Abacha, the head of state, has already granted a license for the subsidiary and that the bank intends to make the services available to other banks that are willing to pay to be &quot;hooked.&quot; The acquisition of the license further enhances UBA's profile in the area of new technologies, as it is about the only Nigerian member of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Though Eboighe would not say how much it costs, UBA already operates a dial-up modem and its 1995 Information Technology Plan is expected to transform the bank's branch network into what is called one- stop centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union Bank with the largest network of branches in the country is equally investing in new information technologies. Though Kabir Dangogo, its public relations manager, shied away from elaborating for fear of &quot;our competitors,&quot; he confirmed that two-thirds of the bank's 260 branches have been computerised, with full computerisation expected to be completed soon. Though he would not dabble into specifics, Dangogo told that Union Bank is embarking on a new concept that &quot;will revolutionise our service.&quot; Liberty, UBA and Union Bank are, however, not alone, as virtually all other networth banks are also embarking on the upgrading of their information systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks are equally embarking on increased training of their staff. Here, Union Bank seems to take the lead. Though there are no comparable statistics, Dangogo said that as the largest employer of labour in the industry, they are the biggest trainer of manpower, &quot;as it is our top priority.&quot; Liberty, according to Kokoricha, is voting between three and five per cent of its pre- tax profit for manpower development alone. Going by its 1996 performance, that would amount to roughly N15 million this year, a big investment on what Kokoricha described as &quot;strategic intent to improve the quality of our people, step up recruiting hurdles and build a learning culture within the bank.&quot; To demonstrate the imperatives of human resource development, banks which can afford it are sending their top management staff abroad for courses. One of the latest beneficiaries is Fola Adeola, managing director of Guaranty Trust Bank, debatably the second most profitable new generation bank, who vacated his cosy office for a six-month training programme at America's Harvard Business School, possibly the world's topmost business school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even banks which cannot afford the prohibitive cost of overseas courses are sending their staff for various forms of training, here at home, especially at the elitist Lagos Business School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks are, however, holding close to their chest, specific innovative strategies they are embarking on to satisfy their customers apart from the accuracy and speed guaranteed by the investment in new technologies. Either for fear of having their innovations snatched by competitors or because the new financial products are still awaiting Central Bank approval, bankers are unveiling very little. Among the innovations that have already seen the light of day is First Bank's Western Union Money Transfer, where money from any part of the world could be conveniently sent to anyone resident in Nigeria without the person necessarily banking with the bank. Union Bank has equally introduced its Easycash automated teller machine in some parts of Lagos to enable account holders cash their &quot;cheque&quot; with ease and without congesting the counter. On its part, Liberty Merchant Bank is diversifying into &quot;fairly new areas of business&quot; such as specific Investment Banking and Trust Company, it last week embarked on the most ambitious unit trust scheme in the country and with a lot of foreign input, requiring a stake-holder to cough out a minimum of N20,000.  Apart from its Easycash, Union Bank is packaging a &quot;new concept&quot; to meet the yearning of its customers. And with its London and South African offices, the bank hopes to handle the bulk of foreign investment transactions that are expected to come into the Nigerian economy. The bank's optimism was reflected by Dangogo when he boasted: &quot;I don't see how they (foreign investors) will come into Nigeria without going through Union Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To further polish their ambition of cornering plum businesses, many banks are moving to high-profile headquarters. The imposing UBA House on Marina, Lagos, is an example. The Afribank building on Broad Street in Lagos is nearing completion. GTB has already moved to its more spacious Victoria Island head office and Liberty is awaiting CBN approval to relocated. But perhaps the most ambitious structure is the Union Bank House on Marina. The 32-storey building which may be ready for occupation by the first quarter of next year, prides itself as the tallest structure in West Africa and has a helicopter landing facility for cash movement and in case of fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added to these, bankers are becoming more, courteous and customer-friendly, constantly plastering their lips with smiles. Some of the banks, such as Societe Generale and Union, have full fledged customer relations officers with whom customers who receive unsatisfactory services can lodge their complaints. Union Bank has even gone further by opening a hot line for customers to phone managers and complain if they were not satisfactorily attended to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is, these banks that are copying the &quot;ways of the West&quot; don't have a choice. They are aware that to stay in business and be profitable they have got to move with the times. They equally know how fully well that a free market that is beckoning on Nigeria will bring in an unprecedented volume of business and that only highly sophisticated banks can cope. In addition, by next month, the CBN is going to divest itself of its retail banking role, thereby further putting pressure on the banks. But above all else, the era of megabucks for the banks that adequately reform themselves is just by the door- step.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - Amidst support from the World Bank and the IMF, the Vision 2010 Committee reconvenes to map out strategies for tackling the task before it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks after its inauguration, the Vision 2010 Committee reconvenes in Abuja, the country's to weave the plot for the effective tackling of its assignment. Unlike the inauguration and plenary sessions which were mainly ceremonial, the 173 member committee will this time meet for two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), for a seminar to acquaint members with the nitty- gritty of their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee will then break into sub-committees to handle sub-themes of the vision. Ernest Shonekan, committee chairman, has identified 12 such sub- themes, among them norms and standards, good and stable governance, elimination of corruption and accelerated economic growth. His committee has, accordingly, been slated to be split into 12 sub-committees, each to be made up of people with similar interests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the inauguration November 27, the head of state had given the Vision 2010 Committee a terms of reference including defining for Nigeria its correct bearing and sense of economic, political, social and cultural direction; setting appropriate goals, target and time-frame for achieving set economic, political, social and cultural objectives; as well as suggesting comprehensive practical solutions for redeeming Nigeria's external image, and protecting the nation's environment and ecology. In addition, the committee is expected to design a master plan for launching Nigeria as a leading sporting nation in the world. It is also charged with prescribing specific roles for the public and private sectors in economic and social activities, as well as devising means for ensuring proper and credible performance in the roles so assigned to each sector for the attainment of an effective, comprehensive and qualitative health care delivery system and an accelerated agricultural production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha had in his National Day address in which he hinted on the setting up of the committee, told the nation that in order to obliterate the economic and other sectoral calamities which have bedeviled the nation since the oil boom era. &quot;an articulate formula is needed to bring the nation back to course.  &quot; He identified profligacy in government, poor programme implementation and non-planning which made the nation to depend solely on oil, as some of the ills which the committee would seek solutions to. The head of state lamented that previous attempts at planning were done by civil servants &quot;with limited vision, &quot;which informed the choice of technocrats (including traditional rulers and successful traders) to dream for the nation under Vision 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps most significant is the plan by Vision 2010 to identify and redefine the nation's values. Such values, according to committee chairman Shonekan, include social discipline, respect for elders and constituted authorities, hard work, honesty and incorruptibility. As Shonekan put it, &quot;We must now go back to our roots, rediscover the best of African tradition and re-inculcate these virtues in our citizenry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before it begins work, Vision 2010 seems to have become the darling of corporate bodies within the country as well as to the international community.  The World Bank has applauded the setting up of the committee and has even concluded plans to send its poverty alleviation team to the country early next year to liaise with the appropriate sub-committee of Vision 2010 that will fashion out the strategies that would lead to the eradication of poverty in Nigeria by 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interest of the World Bank in project is said to be informed by the similarity of purpose it shares with the Vision 2010 especially in the area of poverty alleviation. Even the fastidious International Monetary Fund has signified interest in the work of the committee. Shonekan disclosed last week that the IMF has pledged to assist Nigeria in the formulation and actualization of the vision. On their part, some corporate bodies within the country have organised seminars aimed at generating ideas which they hope to give as inputs to the work of the committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encouraged by the enthusiasm of these organisations, and the need to involve all Nigerians in the vision, the committee has called for memoranda from interested persons, groups and institutions. With the interest the vision now generates locally and internationally, the nation can hardly wait for September 1997, when government expects to receive the official report of the visioners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Human Rights Watch/Africa today welcomed the release on bail of Kenya's prominent opposition figure Koigi wa Wamwere on December 13, 1996, and called on the Kenyan government to grant bail to Koigi's two co- defendants Charles Kuria Wamwere and Godfrey Ngengi Njuguna who remain in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wamwere's application was granted on medical grounds and bail was set at Kshs. 200,000 (approximately U.S. $3,500). &quot;Releasing Koigi on bail is a welcome and long-overdue step which will hopefully be followed by bail to his co-accused,&quot; noted Executive Director Peter Takirambudde. &quot;But the real question is: when will the Kenyan government end its political manipulation of the judicial system?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koigi wa Wamwere, a former member of parliament and founder of a human rights organization, is a long-time critic of the government of President Daniel arap Moi and has been continually harassed by the government. Mr.  Wamwere is a former political prisoner, adopted by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience while detained on treason charges between October 1990 and January 1993. The charges were eventually dropped, but Mr. Wamwere was held without bail during that time and complained of mistreatment at the hands of security officials. In September 1993, Mr. Wamwere was arrested along with others and charged with possessingseditious publications which included leaflets published by his human rights organization on the issue of ethnic violence. He was held for one month before being released on bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wamwere was arrested again on November 5, 1993, along with fourteen others and accused by the government of attempting to raid a police station in Nakuru and to rob two police constables of their rifles on November 2, 1993. The initial press conference announcing the raid described the perpetrators without reference to Mr. Wamwere or the others arrested. The government eventually released or dropped charges against twelve of those initially arrested with Mr. Wamwere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has continued to pursue charges of armed robbery against Mr.  Wamwere, Charles Kuria Wamwere (his brother) and Godfrey Ngengi Njuguna. The three defendants were convicted in the lower court proceeding, which resulted in a sentence of four years and six strokes of the cane in October 1995. The trial was criticized by local and international human rights groups and bar organizations for not meeting international standards. The trial is continuing on appeal. Until his release on bail on November 13, 1996, Mr.  Wamwere was held in Nakuru prison, where there is severe overcrowding, diet is poor and prisoners have frequently been denied adequate medical treatment.  Charles Kuria Wamwere and Godfrey Ngengi Njuguna remain in Nakuru prison to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political nature of the trial is underscored by the fact that the week before Mr. Wamwere's release on bail, the Chief Justice in Nairobi asked for the files to be sent to him in Nairobi. Under Kenyan law, the Chief Justice need not see a file in order for a bail application to be approved. Human Rights Watch/Africa shares the belief of other human rights organizations that the arrest of Mr. Wamwere and his co-accused is part of a pattern of harassment of human rights activists, political opposition figures and government critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch/Africa called on the Kenyan government to restore judicial independence and end its practice of using criminal charges to harass government critics. Human Rights Watch/Africa also called on the government to release on bail Mr. Wamwere's two co-defendants currently being held under the same charges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Angola might have lost 90 percent of its larger mammals, in addition to other wildlife, killed during the civil war between the government in Luanda and anti-government Angolan forces called UNITA, a study by environmentalists shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, by the Southern African Research and Documentation Center in Harare -- in collaboration with the International Conservation Union -- is on the impact of armed conflict in the Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contained in the 1994 report on the &quot;State of the Environment in Southern Africa&quot;, researchers say that similar destruction of wildlife occurred in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Zambia following fighting in those countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Africa had been engaged in wars for independence lasting decades.  In addition, Angola and Mozambique have experienced civil wars between nationalistic forces and those opposed to socialist rule in their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After years of fighting Portuguese colonialists, Angola's civil war started after independence in 1975 and ended formally 20 years later. There is now a United Nations-sponsored cease-fire in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists say that armed conflict has resulted in the multiplicity of environmental hazards in the region which have, in parts, hampered sustainable environmental management and caused economic and social instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among these problems they say are localized deforestation caused by large concentrations of displaced people. These people were normally crammed on the periphery of urban areas and largely depended on fuel wood for energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pollution has also been cited as another fall-out of wars, following the breakdown of infrastructure and management of wastes. This has been the case in South Africa where the manufacture and testing of military equipment has led to pollution of local water bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Angola, people have been making brisk business from scrap metal and disabled military material strewn around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angola produces about 10,000 tones of scrap metal each year added to the country's junk resulting from two decades of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists estimate that the country accumulated 500,000 tons of scrap metal by 1990, most of it in the &quot;vehicle graveyards&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Junk metal earned the Angolan treasury some six million dollars in 1990 in exports to South African scrap metal dealers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The Ambassador of the Republic of China (Taiwan) to South Africa left Johannesburg Sunday for Taipei, following Pretoria's recent announcement that diplomatic relations between the two countries would end on Dec. 31, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before his departure, Ambassador I-Cheng Loh said his government was extremely disillusioned by South Africa's decision to switch diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing from 1998.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described his recall as a way for the Taiwan government to tell South Africa that it would be forced to renew its relation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe we have supported South Africa to the best of our ability,&quot; Loh said, &quot;and our support was substantially larger than that of many countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the question of his return to South Africa in the future would depend on the development of bilateral negotiations on a new framework for future relations between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see myself returning next year to take part in the negotiations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Loh's departure follows a statement by the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of China, saying it had withdrawn its ambassador for an indefinite period, as South Africa's unfriendly announcement had: &quot;seriously damaged Taiwan's dignity and interests, as well as bilateral relations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiwan has also suspended 15 aid and cooperation programmes with South Africa, as well as most of the 36 existing agreements between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is generally accepted that South Africa was the most important of the 30 countries -- many of them African -- which until now recognized Taiwan as opposed to Mainland China.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - Stagnant for the past eight years, economic ties between Algiers and Ottawa are set for a revival, beginning with the construction of a new Canadian embassy in the Algerian capital, an official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, Dan Bourdria, is Canada's minister for international cooperation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting this Monday, an Algerian newspaper, Presse Algiers, quoted Bourdria as saying that Algeria was good for business, despite the running war with Moslem militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boudia was accompanied by a strong business delegation during his two-day visit. He signed five cooperation agreements related to the creation of a joint fishery company and to financial aid to Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada has loaned 75 million U.S. dollars to the Algerian Development Bank.  In October, Canada loaned 55 million dollars to the Algerian hydrocarbon company, SONATRACH.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boudria said that Algeria was expected to receive the larger share of 60 million dollars granted to all the Maghreb countries under the Canadian aid programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year ago, Algeria bought Canadian wheat worth 400 million dollars. Canada imported 300 million dollars worth of Algerian oil.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - A Lusaka High Court adjourned on Monday hearing of an interim injunction granted to former President Kenneth Kaunda seeking to stop the airing of a documentary on him by the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda's lawyer, Mwangala Zaloumis, told reporters Monday that the court had refused her application to review the anti-Kaunda documentary, &quot;A Trail of Deceit&quot;, before hearing of the injunction resumes Dec 23.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The corporation was restrained last week from televising the show after Kaunda won an injunction to stay the broadcast.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Lagos state administrator, Col. Muhammed Marwa, escaped unhurt when a suspected time bomb exploded Monday on a busy Lagos road, wounding two people in his convoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have arrested six suspects in connection with the incident, which occurred near the Sheraton Hotel, in the Ikeja district of Lagos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the hotel's window was shattered by the blast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos State Commissioner of Police Abubakar Tsva confirmed that &quot;the administrator was not injured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told journalists that the explosion, suspected to be a time-bomb, had been planted under a stone beside the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The device exploded at about 7.20 a.m. (0620 GMT), as Marwa past that section of the road on his way to the office at the Lagos State Government Secretariat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tsva said the last vehicle in the convoy, a peugeot, was damaged and two of its occupants seriously wounded. Police and army bomb experts are investigating the blast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Deputy Superintendent Goni Gogo said there was a striking similarity between the device and the Nov 14. explosion near the Murtala Muhammed International Airport which killed three people, among them the airport's chief security officer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Nairobi (PANA) - The second summit of heads of state and government on the volatile Great Lakes Region began Monday in Nairobi without two key players, Burundi and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the two-day meeting attended by nine heads of state and government, Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi described the non-participation of Zaire as regrettable because he had done everything possible to ensure that Zaire, torn by civil strife, was represented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian military leader Pierre Buyoya, who seized power July 25, was not invited because his government is not recognized. Moreover, regional countries have enforced an economic blockade against Bujumbura.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing the situation in Zaire as sensitive, Moi said he was in contact with Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko up to Monday and that he had promised to send his prime minister, &quot;I have not received any positive response&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi added: &quot;It would have been useful and helpful if Zaire had accepted my invitation in order to explain to this summit their perception of the problem they face and how they expect to be assisted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi probably set the tone of the summit when he said the &quot;Zairean problem is a sensitive and internal matter to that country&quot;, emphasizing the need for respect for territorial integrity and calling for the withdrawal of any foreign forces inside Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kinshasa government has accused Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda of supporting Tutsi-led rebels who have conquered much of eastern Zaire.  Meanwhile, the Zairean parliament has passed a law barring the country's participation in meetings such as the current regional summit as long as Zairean territory is occupied by &quot;foreign troops&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi said since the last regional summit in Nairobi on November 5, there had been further incursions into Zaire. Such actions, he said, would only serve to prolong the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This calls for a change to our approach to the crisis and our emphasis should, therefore, shift to helping Zaire,&quot; Moi said, in an appeal to the international community and humanitarian organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Moi said &quot;virtually all&quot; the estimated half a million Rwandan refugees who were in Zaire were now back home, relief agencies say there are another 500,000 people on the move in eastern Zaire, running away from an offensive by rebels determined to topple the government in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidents of South Africa and Zimbabwe, Nelson Mandela and Robert Mugabe are attending the summit for the first time in their capacities as chairmen of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and of the SADC organ in Politics, Defence and Security, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other heads of state and government attending are Presidents Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, Isaias Afeworki of Eritrea as well as Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. The Organization of African Unity (O.A.U.) secretary-general, Salim Ahmed Salim, and former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere who is acting as mediator on Burundi are also attending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameroon, which chairs the O.A.U., was represented by a senior government official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the floor at the opening ceremony as he had to return home the same day, Mandela described the Zairean situation as sensitive and that he would rather reserve his comments for a meeting of heads of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said that Mugabe, as head of the SADC organ on Politics, Defence and Security, would be able to articulate the region's position on the crisis in the Great Lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources close to the summit said the leaders were expected to adopt a communique which would call on Zaire to recognize the inalienable right to citizenship and nationality of all people within its boundaries. This is a direct reference to the mainly Tutsi population that moved to eastern Zaire some 200 years ago and are now being forced to return to the original homes of their ancestors in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Health Organisation representative, Dr Wilfred Boayue, says his organisation has started working closely with the Zambian government through the Ministry of Health on how to control the situation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition WHO has attached one of its officers to the Ministry of Health, specifically on the committee working out modalities on how to prevent cholera through a sustained campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The WHO is ready to co-operate more with the Ministry of Health in order to fight the cholera outbreak much more effectively,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far cases of the disease have been breaking out sporadically in most major centres of the country including the capital - Lusaka. But even then these cases have been confined to the sprawling shanty towns where standards of hygiene are virtually none-existent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date there have been no deaths recorded in Lusaka over the upsurge of cholera.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serge Bosc, the in-charge of technical and cultural co-operation at the French Embassy in Lusaka disclosed today that the book is already circulating in Europe and many people are eager to read it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book is entitled &quot;La Zambie Contemporaine&quot; and it was prepared with the knowledge of the Zambian government and it aims to correct the bad publicity which Zambia has unjustly suffered by portraying a correct and true political and cultural situation in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book also includes issues related to women and gender as well as the environment and business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bosc said relations between Zambia and France is warm and his government intends to keep things that way adding that friendship ought to be kept alive and warm at both government and community levels and in this regard the French were happy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - JUNIOR international, Edward &quot;Bubble Brown&quot; Kangwa, yesterday went on rampage scoring a brace to give the Zambia national soccer team a deserved 2-0 win over their Kenyan counterparts, the Harambee Stars, in an international friendly played in Mombasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kangwa, a last minute inclusion in the team currently in Kenya for a series of friendlies, drew first blood in the first half after rounding up a couple of Kenyan shirts before unleashing a cannon that left the Kenyan keeper sprawled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second half, Kangwa continued to terrorise the Kenyan defence with subtle moves aided by a well oiled midfield marshalled by Aggrey Chiyangi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A defensive blunder by the Kenyans provided the chink that the ZANACO point man needed to slot in the second and final goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the game, Chiyangi enthused: &quot;We played better than the last game. At least the pitch was better than the one we used in Nairobi when we lost 1-0.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Chiyangi, the team will return home on Tuesday, dispelling reports that they would proceed to Uganda for two more friendlies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The information we have is that we will return home on Tuesday. We don't know anything about going to Uganda,&quot; Chiyangi said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The voters' register had too many mistakes, observed Zambia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) chairman, George Chabwera, on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chabwera, speaking at an Alliance forum at Lusaka's Intercontinental Hotel on Friday, revealed that he failed to vote due to errors on the register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my case I could not vote because there was a mix up regarding my name,&quot; Chabwera said. &quot; I had to be omitted from the register.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite pointing out mistakes in the Nikuv register, Chabwera condemned the Opposition Alliance's decision to boycott the November 18 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did not vote myself because of too many mistakes in the register but ladies and gentlemen, you have to be aware of the activities of the old regime, their interest is their survival,&quot; Chabwera said. &quot;Liberation politics and civil disobedience cannot work at the moment. For us in ZACCI we are very disappointed with the Alliance of the opposition for boycotting the elections. You denied your members the right to decide the leaders they wanted and you denied us an opportunity too because you robbed the people of a chance to choose their rightful leaders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And reacting to Chabwera's remarks, Opposition Alliance and Liberal Progressive Front chairman, Rodger Chongwe, said they had opted to boycott the elections because the electoral process was fraudulent and the results were predetermined. He claimed that the results were planned that UNIP would get 45 seats, MMD 96 and the rest 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The basis of the boycott was because we did not want to take part in the elections whose electoral process was fraudulent. The election results were predetermined,&quot; Chongwe told the ZACCI team which included executive secretary Gideon Phiri, board member Theo Bull, and national trustee Yvonne Goma. &quot;As businessmen you may support the government in power but if the government is unable to govern the country properly there will be no conducive environment for you to do business in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe warned that the issues at hand were serious and affected the nation as a whole and not just political parties hence the need for the business community and associations to get involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And other leaders of the Alliance - UNIP secretary general Sebastian Zulu, Labour Party president Chibeza Mfuni and his vice Paul Kapongo, National Democratic Party president Tenthani Mwanza, Salvation Party president David Kasuba - all urged the business community to face reality and get involved in solving the current political crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zulu warned that Zambia was sitting on a volcano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have information that the army will take over,&quot; Zulu said. &quot;We are not threatening you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mfuni said the business community had a crucial role to play in any situation involving the politicians since it had the necessary finances and infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bull, who walked out of the talks shortly after presenting his views, told opposition parties not to put blame on the government alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have lost aid because of the high interest rates and because of MMD. I don't think it is good to blame the government anyhow,&quot; Bull said and dramatically walked out of the forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president Alfred Zulu yesterday said in an interview that the business world should come out from its shell and take an impartial and pragmatic view on what is happening in the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The corporate world led by ZACCI is so naive to issues of good governance and I think businessmen ought to come out from their shell and identify themselves with entire society and the system,&quot; Zulu said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Only an independent and autonomous Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) can exercise absolute impartiality, said ACC commissioner justice Robert Kapembwa on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Kapembwa said &quot;autonomy is important because, in fighting corruption, there is need to be absolutely impartial&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And justice Kapembwa assured that the ACC Bill, which is now awaiting presidential assent, will enable the Commission increase its capacity to fight corruption.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commissioner, Robert Kapembwa said the new bill had certain positive features which would enable the commission &quot;cast its net wider&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he added, &quot;only an independent and autonomous body can exercise absolute impartiality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Kapembwa said the Bill would stop accusations of double standards when dealing with top government officials who are suspected of corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The so-called 'small fish-big fish' syndrome will come to an end with the enactment of the Bill,&quot;he assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACC Bill was widely opposed by ruling MMD back benchers at the close of the 7th Session of Parliament. The back benchers charged that the Bill was manufactured during finance minister Ronald Penza's last trip to Washington where the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cited good governance as a pre- requisite to donor aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They called for lengthy amendments to the Bill which were conceded to by cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He emphasised that even under the current law the Commission did not need presidential consent to prosecute top government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it comes to prosecutions we do not have to get consent from the President,&quot; justice Kapembwa said. &quot; The reports we submit to him are merely to inform the President.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And British High Commissioner to Zambia, Patrick Nixon, officially opening the re-furbished training centre for ACC investigators and prosecutors, said corruption was a worldwide syndrome which needed concerted efforts to eradicate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No country is immune to corruption. It is like cancer cutting away the heart of a country and we should therefore, stand up to stamp it out,&quot; Nixon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The occasion marked the completion of a K980 million three-year programme of assistance by the British government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Kapembwa said the centre would assist in the training of competent &quot; and honest&quot; personnel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. TANZANIA - information as of mid-day, 13 December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Approximately 400,000 refugees from the Ngara camps of Kitali Hills, Lumasi, Benaco, Keza and Mushuhura have left the camps and were reported on 12 and 13 December to be moving south-east from Ngara in what seemed to be an effort to avoid repatriation to Rwanda. The majority of these refugees had received a two-week WFP food ration before they dispersed and were said to be carrying possessions with them. However, on the afternoon of 13 December, it was reported that many refugees (numbers unknown) were heading towards the border of Rwanda at Rusumo, about 20 kms north-west of Ngara. Many also reported to have returned to the abandoned camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Some 80,000 Burundian refugees remain in two camps in Ngara and are not on the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Prior to the Ngara movement, approximately 23,000 refugees had fled the Tanzanian camps on 10 December, mainly from Kagenyi and Rubwera camps in Karagwe district. While most have now returned to the camps, UNHCR reports that approximately 10,000 are still in the surrounding area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Some 800 and 1,928 refugees repatriated from Ngara on 9 and 10 December respectively. On the morning of 11 December, 644 refugees repatriated, bringing the total number of returnees from Tanzania from 1 to 11 December to 4,179.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 In order to meet increased supplementary feeding needs of the more recently arrived refugees in the Kibondo district of Kigoma region, WFP is airlifting some 45 metric tons of corn-soya blend with the assistance of the multi-national force led by Canada. A further 300 metric tons has been despatched by road. Influxes to the Kigoma region of Tanzania continue from both Zaire and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. RWANDA - information as of 12 December</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 WFP Rwanda is ready for the returnees from Tanzania with stocks of high- protein biscuits and food commodities in place for distribution. Seven way- stations have been set up and 200,000 biscuit rations are pre-positioned alongside 37 km of road between Rusumo and Curazo (Kibungo prefecture). The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the Rwandan Red Cross and World Vision are responsible for the way stations. WFP also has staff ready to receive the returnees throughout Kibungo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 General food stocks in Kibungo prefecture have been built up over the last week in preparation for the return of several hundred thousand returnees to this prefecture. WFP food stocks in this prefecture, as at 12 December, stood at 285,000 weekly rations, with 167,000 weekly rations pre-positioned in the communes where refugees are expected to return. A total of 1,200 metric tons of mixed food commodities are available in Kibungo and an additional 4,000 metric tons are available in Kigali, only two hours from Kibungo. 70 metric tons of high-protein biscuits are also in stock in Kibungo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 In addition, pre-positioning of food stocks is taking place in the communes of Byumba and Umutara prefectures, both of which are also expected to receive a significant number of returnees from Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.4 As of 11 December, total WFP food stocks in-country designated for the returnee programme as a whole are 3,937 metric tons, equivalent to approximately 230,000 monthly rations or 980,000 weekly rations. The total stock of high-protein biscuits in Rwanda is at 372 metric tons, equivalent to 1,860,000 daily rations. The overall WFP food stock level in Rwanda stands at 8,000 metric tons, for all programmes. WFP also has significant quantities of food within the region: 12,603 metric tons in Kampala and Isaka and 17,992 metric tons in Dar es Salaam and Mombassa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.5 From 16 November to 12 December, WFP and NGO partners (CARE, CRS, LWF, World Vision, Concern, CRR, IFRC, Trocaire, Caritas, ADRA, MEC, GAA, AHA, World Relief, AEF, EEF, IRC, MSF, ASS, Salvation Army, Ingabo) distributed approximately 10,020 metric tons of food commodities (cereals, pulses and oil) , representing 600,000 persons assisted with a monthly ration. In addition, more than 1,250,000 daily high-protein biscuit rations have been distributed.  All returnees are believed to have received at least a two-week ration with the majority having received a one-month ration. Registration of returnees in the communes continues, with around 70 per cent of the returnees counted so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.6 From 3 to 9 December, 5,077 Rwandan refugees came back from Zaire (3, 165 via Gisenyi and 1,912 via Cyangugu), 1,536 from Tanzania and 288 from Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.7 The Rwanda Government launched an appeal for USD 739.4 million to resettle returnees (including the Tanzania caseload). The Governments of Canada and Rwanda are co-chairing a meeting in Kigali on 13 and 14 December which will focus on the coordination and implementation of assistance to returnees. Major donors, UN Agencies and non-governmental organizations will attend the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. EASTERN ZAIRE - information as of 12 December</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 From 7 to 9 December, a joint UN/NGO/Government of Zaire mission visited the Shabunda/Kindu area, some 175 km west of Bukavu, and flew at low altitude around the Lubutu/Walikale/ Bukavu area. The mission found approximately 10,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees in the town of Shabunda and up to 40,000 in two camps near the town. An additional 20,000 to 30,000 refugees were reported in Walikale and 10,000 to 15,000 refugees in Lubutu.  WFP is presently studying the possibility of assessing the needs of the population around Shabunda and of distributing needed food commodities.  Access to this area is very difficult due to insecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 A UN team, of WFP, UNHCR and UNICEF representatives, visited the Uvira area from 7 to 9 December. Access to the port was denied as was access to Fizi, for security reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 Goma area</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) The northern axis from Goma continues to be closed to all international humanitarian personnel. Access to the western and southern routes as far as Kalungu (some 50 km west of Goma) is permitted. Assessment missions as far as Kitchungu, half-way between Sake and Masisi, have been undertaken by the UN, however the terrain and the location of pockets of resistance are unknown and thus the area is deemed unsafe for further travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) From 26 November to 8 December, WFP distributed approximately 27 metric tons of food assistance, mostly high-protein biscuits, to over 25,000 returnees on their way back to Rwanda, as well as to Zairians requiring assistance near or in Goma town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) The food supply situation in Goma is limited, as a reduction in the number of trucks arriving to the town has led to a price increase of 66 percent for imported goods. Vegetables and fruits have increased in price by some 150 percent. This is caused mainly by the fact that food production areas in the highlands are inaccessible due to insecurity. Fighting forced most of the population to flee to other areas, leaving their farms, which for the most part were destroyed and looted when they left. In addition, with the repatriation of refugees, the cost of labour has escalated. WFP is studying food requirements in the area, with particular emphasis on food security and the means to reestablish the previous supply network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">d) From 10 to 12 December, approximately 3,900 refugees crossed the border from Goma to Gisenyi. The returnees came partly through the Virunga forest and partly from the direction of Minova and Numbi. Some 400 refugees returned through the Bukavu/Cyangugu border point on 11 December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 Former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere has invited &quot;all groups&quot; involved in the conflict in Burundi to negotiations in Arusha, Tanzania.  Negotiation between the Burundian government and opposition and rebel groups is the last remaining condition for regional sanctions to be lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 FAO issued a statement this past week predicting that a decrease in agricultural production and the effects of the regional sanctions will adversely affect the nutritional status of the Burundian population in general and internally displaced persons in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.3 Insecurity continued in Kayanza and Bujumbura Rural provinces, and deteriorated in Bubanza province. Information is not available on the security situation in much of the country, but it is clear that many parts of Bururi, Muramvya, Gitega and Karuzi provinces continue to be unsafe. Conflict was particularly serious in Kayanza province with reports that up to 500 people may have been killed, thousands of houses destroyed and large numbers of people forced to moved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.4 The WFP Burundi caseload totaled 148,957 from 2 to 8 December.  Emergency relief rations were provided to 10,401 displaced persons at the Johnson Centre in Bujumbura. WFP delivered commodities to the NGO VISPE for distribution to 15,000 displaced persons in Karuzi province. MSF-Belgium has reported that the nutritional situation in Karuzi remains alarming, affecting up to 50,000 displaced persons. WFP is trying to send needs evaluation teams to different areas of Kayanza where it is reported that up to 30,000 displaced persons are in need of assistance. WFP has started to despatch food commodities to CRS in Gitega, sufficient for 20,000 beneficiaries, for 14-day emergency relief distributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.5 Some 27,600 persons benefited from WFP returnee packages. Benficiaries included 2,105 spontaneous returnees to Cibitoke province. Distributions in this province continue to be carried out in very difficult conditions, as military-escorted convoys in armoured vehicles are necessary for access to the area. Returnee package rations are deemed sufficient for three months consumption, providing about 1,215 kcal/person/day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. ANGOLA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE 1.1 On 12 December, a WFP official was murdered in the northern province of Kwanza North. Mr. Jorge Leitao, an Angolan, was the WFP base manager for the area. He was shot dead by unknown attackers on the road linking the towns of Ndalatando and Ngonguembo. Mr Leitao was on a mission at the time to coordinate information on the tracing of families of child soldiers who are in the process of being demobilised, part of WFP's current rehabilitation work in Angola.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Rwandan refugees began pouring back into Rwanda from Ngara camps in Tanzania over the weekend. DHA in Kigali reported that by yesterday, some 24,000 refugees had crossed the border into Rwanda and the flow was increasing towards the end of the day with some 5,000 refugees crossing every hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the returnees who arrived at the Birenga transit centre in Kibungo prefecture had already been trucked onto their home communes by yesterday.  DHA reported a 10km long column of refugees inside Rwanda. However information is quite hard to come by, as access along the 60km stretch of road from Kibungo town to the Tanzanian border is restricted and most NGOs have not yet been allowed to operate. Assistance is currently being provided by the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Rwandan Red Cross.  UNHCR has also been allowed to cross the border. The biggest of the Ngara camps - Benaco - is now empty as 200,000 refugees are said to be heading for the border.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of this morning, a steady stream of refugees continued to cross into Rwanda. Returning refugees report that the Tanzanian authorities have been using tear gas and firing into the air to prompt an exodus from the camps. UN staff in Ngara yesterday reported some NGOs as saying large numbers of people were still in the bush and two fairly large of concentrations of 5,000 and 10, 000 were said to be moving south and east. The team also reported that significant portions of the population in the Karagwe camps appeared to be &quot; at large&quot; outside the control of both UNHCR and the authorities. Two large groups of people are said to be heading for Kenya. UNHCR is hoping to truck the inhabitants of Karagwe down to Ngara from where they could walk across the border, UN staff said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IOM, according to a DHA report from Kigali, has positioned 76 trucks at a BP station 22 kms from the border with a further 70 trucks in Kibungo. IOM also indicated that the Rwandan government has said it will closely monitor the repatriation process and will use the army to intervene if necessary. By 1830 last night, a significant army presence was in evidence along the road to the Nyakarambi transit camp, near Gatore. Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu was on hand to welcome the returnees at the Rusumo border point yesterday, but warned that members of the Interahamwe and ex-FAR would be &quot; dealt with&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional leaders are meeting in Nairobi today to discuss the crisis in the Great Lakes, although Zaire and Burundi are not taking part. South African President Nelson Mandela and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe are attending for the first time according to the Kenya News Agency. Burundi mediator, former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere will be at the meeting along with OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 14-nation steering committee which met in New York on Friday decided to wind up the mission of the Canadian-led multi-national force by the end of this month. After the announcement was made in New York, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien issued a statement in Ottawa saying the force had served as a &quot;catalyst&quot; for the return of hundreds of thousands of refugees to Rwanda. Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy also claimed the mission had led to the refugees' return. &quot;The fact that the movement of peoples took place exactly at the time when the announcement of the international force was made is not a coincidence,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome - TANZANIA: As of mid-morning on 16 December, a total of 45,000 Rwandan refugees returned to Rwanda from Ngara camps in Tanzania. This includes some 30,000 who repatriated on 15 December and some 7,500 who returned on 14 December. It appears that the repatriation is organised by camp, with Lumasi camp already emptied and Benaco camp almost empty. Both camps are in the Ngara region. The Tanzanian authorities, who are assisting with the return of the Rwandan refugees, appear to be concentrating on the Ngara camps prior to the Karagwe camps.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RWANDA:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All refugees are entering Rwanda at Rusumo (Kibungo). On the Rwandan side of the border the majority of refugees are walking the first 20 km towards Kibungo. Some vulnerable refugees are however receiving transportation from the border point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The returnees appear to be in a good nutritional state. WFP food aid distributions in Ngara camps were completed only three days ago when all returnees received two-week rations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP is distributing high-energy biscuits to returnees at Rwenteru way- station (20 km from the border) and at two other way stations on the way to Kibungo town. Provision of biscuits closer to the border had to be halted when local authorities declared they would allow only the National Red Cross to operate in the area between the border and Rwenteru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kibungo prefecture, from where 65 per cent of the Rwandan refugees in Tanzania originate (340,000 persons), WFP food stocks consist of 150 mt of high-energy biscuits (750,000 daily rations), 828 mt of cereals, pulses and oil already pre-positioned in the Kibungo communes (219,000 weekly rations), as well as 636 mt of mixed commodities at the extended delivery point and transit centres (168,000 weekly rations). WFP also has large quantities of stocks in Kigali, which is a two-hour drive from Kibungo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven WFP storage tents are operational in Kibungo prefecture (3,100 mt capacity in total). Two are in Nyakarambi transit centre, two in Kibungo town and one each in Kigarama, Kayonza and Murambi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pre-positioning of food stocks is also taking place in communes of Byumba and Umutara prefectures, both of which are also expected to receive a significant number of returnees from Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP's food distributions in other prefectures of Rwanda (to returnees from Zaire and within the Rwanda Rehabilitation Programme) continue uninterrupted despite the emergency in Kibungo. They are implemented with the assistance of 22 NGOs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - As of 14:00 today, 60,000 Rwandan refugees had crossed into their homeland from Tanzania's Ngara camps, bringing the total number of returnees since Saturday to 90,000, according to UNHCR figures. The refugees were said to be crossing at the rate of up to 15,000 an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BBC correspondent said the flow was intensifying every hour, although mid- afternoon, the rate slowed because of heavy rain. However a number of refugees were reluctant to return and the BBC said Hutu militias were seen jogging in formation away from the border.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees from the Rubwera and Kagere camps in northwest Tanzania, who do not want to return to Rwanda, continued to arrive at Orukinga camp in Uganda's Mbarara area at the rate of about 500 a day, reports the IFRC. The initial response of the Ugandan border authorities has been to send some of the refugees back to Tanzania, but refugees have been crossing the Kagera river on the border under cover of night. A total of 2,000 refugees have arrived and according to some reports, 30,000 may be on their way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda is to receive $500 million in international aid to help with the repatriation of returnees, Canadian International Cooperation Minister Don Boudria said on Saturday. His announcement followed a meeting of donor countries and aid organisations in Kigali on Friday which was a follow-up to the Great Lakes humanitarian aid conference held in Geneva last month. During that meeting, Rwanda appealed for $740 million to help resettle the returnees.  Boudria said the priority was housing, but aid would also be channelled towards boosting Rwanda's judicial and social service systems, as well as agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fuel prices and public transport fares have increased considerably in Kinshasa, raising fears of a backlash by residents unable to afford the price hikes. Zairean radio, monitored by BBC, on Friday announced that fuel prices had risen from 68,000 to 71,000 new zaires, and the price per litre of gasoline now stood at 78,000 new zaires. Bus fares had risen from 30,000 to 35,000 new zaires, and taxis from 35,000 to 40,000 new zaires. The Zairean government also submitted budget proposals to parliament on Friday which called for reserving 35 percent of overall public spending in the coming financial year for defence, Reuters reported. It said that in recent weeks, the government had imposed extra taxes on local and international businesses as contributions to the war effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean President Mobutu is due back in the country tomorrow after an absence of over three months, Zairean television announced. He underwent cancer surgery in Switzerland in August, and has since been convalescing in the south of France. Mobutu is expected to stay at the Tshatshi military camp in Kinshasa and will make a broadcast to the nation. Observers point out that Zairean public opinion expects Mobutu to take personal charge of military counter-offensive aimed at re-establishing control in the rebel-held east of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFRC has delivered a consignment of 10 MT of relief supplies for tens of thousands of refugees and displaced people in Kisangani. A Hercules C-130 flew into the town yesterday in what IFRC described as the first of a series of regular flights between Kisangani and Nairobi. Kisangani itself was reported to be calm, and food supplies had already been flown into the town by France and Belgium. Aid organisations were expected to airlift more supplies this week. NCA/ACT have begun airlifting food and medicines to Kisangani, for distribution there, and onward delivery to Lubutu by land and Katshungu by air. AFP quoted relief agencies as saying some 500,000 people were on the move in eastern Zaire heading westwards in the regions of Kindu, Lobutu, Walikale and Shabunda ahead of the rebel offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various reports said the original population of Lobutu have vacated the town and some 90,000 refugees and displaced people had moved in, probably including Interahamwe and ex-FAR. Aid organisations on the ground corroborated the information, saying these people were staying put in Lobutu and not moving on to Kisangani. According to IFRC, 300,000 displaced people were stuck between Walikale and Lobutu without food and assistance, and were in a poor state. UN sources said Zairean military authorities were blocking the refugee advance some 200km east of Kisangani near Lubutu, and some 200 km east of Kindu near Shabunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was probable that this would lead to the natural creation of camps as the refugee population in Shabunda and Lobutu continued to swell. An ex-FAR camp near Kingulube, some 180km east of Shabunda, has - according to Zairean security officials in Kinshasa - reportedly been dismantled but it is not known where the former Rwandan soldiers have moved to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi on Saturday expressed surprise over a UN human rights report which said over 1,000 people had been killed in just one month in the country, mostly by government forces. Interior Minister Epitace Bayaganakandi said he did not know the sources used by UN observers, nor how they had worked out the number of people killed during fighting in Burundi. Bayaganakandi added that it had &quot;become a habit among some agencies to ignore the crimes of terrorist organisations and to blame systematically the Burundi army for killings with inflated casualty figures for propaganda purposes.&quot; Also on Saturday, Burundi's Foreign Minister Luc Rukingama again appealed for the lifting of economic sanctions imposed on his country by regional countries following the July coup. Speaking in connection with Burundi peace talks in the Tanzanian town of Arusha, he said his government had drawn up several recommendations for peace in Burundi which would be presented to mediator Julius Nyerere. Tanzanian radio said five parties from Burundi, including the Hutu-dominated Frodebu party and the exiled extremist Hutu organisation CNDD, were represented in Arusha. Few details of the meeting have been released.  Meanwhile, the UN in Tanzania announced that three barges loaded with fertilisers and medicines, exempt from the regional sanctions, left the port of Kigoma for Bujumbura on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda has said it will grant an amnesty to rebel leader Joseph Kony if leaders in the north - where he is waging his rebellion - and next of kin of people killed by his fighters, agree to pardon him. According to newspaper reports, special presidential adviser Salim Saleh told a seminar in the northern town of Gulu on Saturday that Kony - who leads the Lord's Resistance Army - could then return to Gulu and resume his career as a Roman Catholic catechist. AFP said that until now, President Museveni had refused to grant an amnesty to Kony, saying he must stand trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Angola might have lost 90 percent of its larger mammals, in addition to other wildlife, killed during the civil war between the government in Luanda and anti-government Angolan forces called UNITA, a study by environmentalists shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, by the Southern African Research and Documentation Center in Harare -- in collaboration with the International Conservation Union -- is on the impact of armed conflict in the Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contained in the 1994 report on the &quot;State of the Environment in Southern Africa&quot;, researchers say that similar destruction of wildlife occurred in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Zambia following fighting in those countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Africa had been engaged in wars for independence lasting decades.  In addition, Angola and Mozambique have experienced civil wars between nationalistic forces and those opposed to socialist rule in their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After years of fighting Portuguese colonialists, Angola's civil war started after independence in 1975 and ended formally 20 years later. There is now a United Nations-sponsored cease-fire in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists say that armed conflict has resulted in the multiplicity of environmental hazards in the region which have, in parts, hampered sustainable environmental management and caused economic and social instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among these problems they say are localized deforestation caused by large concentrations of displaced people. These people were normally crammed on the periphery of urban areas and largely depended on fuel wood for energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pollution has also been cited as another fall-out of wars, following the breakdown of infrastructure and management of wastes. This has been the case in South Africa where the manufacture and testing of military equipment has led to pollution of local water bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Angola, people have been making brisk business from scrap metal and disabled military material strewn around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angola produces about 10,000 tones of scrap metal each year added to the country's junk resulting from two decades of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists estimate that the country accumulated 500,000 tons of scrap metal by 1990, most of it in the &quot;vehicle graveyards&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Junk metal earned the Angolan treasury some six million dollars in 1990 in exports to South African scrap metal dealers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The Ambassador of the Republic of China (Taiwan) to South Africa left Johannesburg Sunday for Taipei, following Pretoria's recent announcement that diplomatic relations between the two countries would end on Dec. 31, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before his departure, Ambassador I-Cheng Loh said his government was extremely disillusioned by South Africa's decision to switch diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing from 1998.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described his recall as a way for the Taiwan government to tell South Africa that it would be forced to renew its relation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe we have supported South Africa to the best of our ability,&quot; Loh said, &quot;and our support was substantially larger than that of many countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the question of his return to South Africa in the future would depend on the development of bilateral negotiations on a new framework for future relations between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see myself returning next year to take part in the negotiations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Loh's departure follows a statement by the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of China, saying it had withdrawn its ambassador for an indefinite period, as South Africa's unfriendly announcement had: &quot;seriously damaged Taiwan's dignity and interests, as well as bilateral relations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiwan has also suspended 15 aid and cooperation programmes with South Africa, as well as most of the 36 existing agreements between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is generally accepted that South Africa was the most important of the 30 countries -- many of them African -- which until now recognized Taiwan as opposed to Mainland China.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Lagos state administrator, Col. Muhammed Marwa, escaped unhurt when a suspected time bomb exploded Monday on a busy Lagos road, wounding two people in his convoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have arrested six suspects in connection with the incident, which occurred near the Sheraton Hotel, in the Ikeja district of Lagos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the hotel's window was shattered by the blast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos State Commissioner of Police Abubakar Tsva confirmed that &quot;the administrator was not injured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told journalists that the explosion, suspected to be a time-bomb, had been planted under a stone beside the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The device exploded at about 7.20 a.m. (0620 GMT), as Marwa past that section of the road on his way to the office at the Lagos State Government Secretariat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tsva said the last vehicle in the convoy, a peugeot, was damaged and two of its occupants seriously wounded. Police and army bomb experts are investigating the blast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Deputy Superintendent Goni Gogo said there was a striking similarity between the device and the Nov 14. explosion near the Murtala Muhammed International Airport which killed three people, among them the airport's chief security officer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Nairobi (PANA) - The second summit of heads of state and government on the volatile Great Lakes Region began Monday in Nairobi without two key players, Burundi and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the two-day meeting attended by nine heads of state and government, Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi described the non-participation of Zaire as regrettable because he had done everything possible to ensure that Zaire, torn by civil strife, was represented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian military leader Pierre Buyoya, who seized power July 25, was not invited because his government is not recognized. Moreover, regional countries have enforced an economic blockade against Bujumbura.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing the situation in Zaire as sensitive, Moi said he was in contact with Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko up to Monday and that he had promised to send his prime minister, &quot;I have not received any positive response&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi added: &quot;It would have been useful and helpful if Zaire had accepted my invitation in order to explain to this summit their perception of the problem they face and how they expect to be assisted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi probably set the tone of the summit when he said the &quot;Zairean problem is a sensitive and internal matter to that country&quot;, emphasizing the need for respect for territorial integrity and calling for the withdrawal of any foreign forces inside Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kinshasa government has accused Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda of supporting Tutsi-led rebels who have conquered much of eastern Zaire.  Meanwhile, the Zairean parliament has passed a law barring the country's participation in meetings such as the current regional summit as long as Zairean territory is occupied by &quot;foreign troops&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi said since the last regional summit in Nairobi on November 5, there had been further incursions into Zaire. Such actions, he said, would only serve to prolong the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This calls for a change to our approach to the crisis and our emphasis should, therefore, shift to helping Zaire,&quot; Moi said, in an appeal to the international community and humanitarian organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Moi said &quot;virtually all&quot; the estimated half a million Rwandan refugees who were in Zaire were now back home, relief agencies say there are another 500,000 people on the move in eastern Zaire, running away from an offensive by rebels determined to topple the government in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidents of South Africa and Zimbabwe, Nelson Mandela and Robert Mugabe are attending the summit for the first time in their capacities as chairmen of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and of the SADC organ in Politics, Defence and Security, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other heads of state and government attending are Presidents Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, Isaias Afeworki of Eritrea as well as Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. The Organization of African Unity (O.A.U.) secretary-general, Salim Ahmed Salim, and former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere who is acting as mediator on Burundi are also attending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameroon, which chairs the O.A.U., was represented by a senior government official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the floor at the opening ceremony as he had to return home the same day, Mandela described the Zairean situation as sensitive and that he would rather reserve his comments for a meeting of heads of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said that Mugabe, as head of the SADC organ on Politics, Defence and Security, would be able to articulate the region's position on the crisis in the Great Lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources close to the summit said the leaders were expected to adopt a communique which would call on Zaire to recognize the inalienable right to citizenship and nationality of all people within its boundaries. This is a direct reference to the mainly Tutsi population that moved to eastern Zaire some 200 years ago and are now being forced to return to the original homes of their ancestors in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The Republic of China, or Taiwan, has suspended air links with South Africa, in retaliation against Pretoria's decision to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing from the end of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials announced Monday in Johannesburg and in Taipei that South African Airways (SAA) had been ordered to stop flying to Taipei from Feb. 15, 1997.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We give SAA two months to prepare to stop flights. But the flights can resume once we have achieved a satisfactory framework for our future ties,&quot; Taiwan Foreign Minister Chang Hsiao-Yen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirming this Tuesday, a SAA spokesman said the company was studying the relevant documentation. The normal cancellation period for landing rights was 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman added that passengers would soon be informed about the implications of the decision to suspend air links. At the moment SAA operates two flights a week from Johannesburg to Taipei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The air pact is the first of a total of 26 government treaties with South Africa that Taiwan is suspending. It is also ending 17 cooperation projects worth almost 4.5 billion U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiwan has also recalled its ambassador to South Africa -- I-Cheng Loh. He left Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his departure, he told the media that he hoped to return to South Africa in 1997 to take part in negotiations aimed at developing a framework for future relations between the two countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, Lt. Col. Rejean Duschesneau, said the first 51 soldiers left Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another 100 soldiers will leave for home on Friday,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All troops will be home by Dec 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to end the mission was taken Saturday by the United Nations steering group set up to resolve the problem. The force, headquartered in Kampala, was initially meant to ensure delivery of food supplies to Rwandan refugees in war-torn eastern Zaire, until March 1997. While Uganda welcomed the mission, Rwanda and Zaire expressed reservations about its role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The multinational force headquarters in Kampala said Canada informed the United Nations that it believed that the military mission was &quot;no longer the most appropriate means to address the humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada's decision to return its troops home was based on the report of the first-hand assessment presented to the steering group by the commander of multinational force, Lt. Gen. Maurice Baril of Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baril was quoted as saying that the force's mission to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid had been overtaken by the voluntary return of Rwandan refugees. He said that humanitarian relief agencies and local authorities could help refugees who remain in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada's focus will now shift to coordinating international efforts under civilian leadership, which it believes will resolve to address the political problems in the central African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baril said that Uganda had given &quot;outstanding support&quot; to the multinational force during its one-month stay in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders meet Monday in Nairobi to review the situation in the region and chose the presidents of Cameroon, Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa to spearhead the peace mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe attended the Great Lakes summit for the first time in his capacity as the chairman of the Southern African Development Community organ on Politics, Defence and Security. South African President Nelson Mandela attended as the community's chairman.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe told journalists on his return to Harare that the committee would include the secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity, Salim Ahmed Salim. Mugabe said that Salim would contact leaders in the directly concerned with the crisis with a view to finding a lasting end to the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should get into action as soon as circumstances allow,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that one of the leaders who will be consulted is Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko, who arrived in Kinshasa Tuesday after prolonged treatment in Switzerland for prostrate cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire has boycotted both summits on the crisis as his parliament has passed a law forbidding participation in any meetings for as long as part of the country was occupied by &quot;foreign forces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said while some Western countries, particularly the United States, had their own ideas about handling the situation in the region, regional players still held the key to achieving peace and stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee has been set up at a time when political analysts say Zaire is building up its forces to counter the offensive by Tutsi-led Zairian rebels who have conquered a substantial part of eastern part of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time Kinshasa has accused Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda of supporting the rebels, known as the Banyamurenge. The anti-government forces have intensified their offensive and are reportedly determined to topple the Kinshasa government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu has been recovering in France from a prostrate cancer operation in Switzerland Aug. 22.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA, Zaire (PANA) - Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko returned home to Kinshasa Thursday amid high expectations that he would end the rebellion that has engulfed most of his country's east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu is expected to make a nationwide radio and television address later in the day, officials in the president's office said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expected to announce a new army chief of staff, ways he intends to deal with the rebellion and methods by which Zaire can complete the country's long transition to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu flew home from France where he was recuperating after surgery four months ago for prostrate cancer, in a Swiss clinic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his absence, fighting erupted between the Zairian army and Zairian Tutsi anti-government forces known as the Banyamulenge, or Banyamurenge.  These anti-government forces have been resisting expulsion from the country where they have lived for some 200 years. The fighting has led to a massive flight of Hutu refugees from eastern Zaire to Rwanda. Hutu refugees initially fled their country after Tutsi-led forces defeated the largely Hutu-led government in Kigali following the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, thousands of Zairians have also been displaced in the rebellion- affected Kivu province.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dakar - Not only will global warming hurt Africa more than any other region, so too may attempts to reduce and compensate for the pollution that causes it. The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice to the Convention on Climate Change are meeting in Geneva this month to work out arrangements which are expected to be made international law by the end of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrangements will likely be a combination of two proposals. One, put forward by the United States, is for the right to pollute carbon dioxide, which is the main reason for the climate change, to be bought and sold like shares, otherwise called 'tradable permits'. (This is based on a 'pollution' stock market that already exists in the US for sulphur dioxide, the cause of acid rain.) The other, proposed by Nordic countries, is for polluting industries to compensate for their pollution in the third world where costs are cheap. That way, advocates claim, poor and under-industrialised countries can also benefit with more foreign investments, the transfer of new technologies, and jobs. This scheme is called ''joint implementation.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both proposals may only add to Africa's burdens, claims African energy specialist Youba Sokona of the Senegalese based NGO Enda-Energy. With the 'tradable permit' scheme he claims that when cash strapped Africa governments sell their right to pollute they also lose the right to industrialise in the future, and if they ever buy the right back it will be at a much higher price.  With joint implementation, Sokona warns that when peasants get paid to grow trees to absorb the carbon dioxide they will stop growing food to feed themselves. The plan, he says, is for ''Africa to get paid to get poorer.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the election behind them, the US now appears eager to turn the talk into action. In November, US President Bill Clinton said &quot;I call upon the community of nations to agree to legally binding commitments to fight climate change&quot;. Timothy Wirth, US undersecretary of state for global affairs, also said that ''developed countries must take up the lead because we are the people primarily responsible for fouling up the nest.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed the nest is getting fouler. According to an intergovernmental assessment of scientists, the emission of 21.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 1990 will, if left unchecked, rise 50 percent by the year 2010. The assessment states that the emissions are largely responsible for having warmed the earth's temperature by 0.3C so far this century, and predicts there will likely be greater extremes of both hot and cold in the near future, with the greatest temperature changes in the northern latitudes, where it will become colder. Effects on human society include higher energy consumption, lower crop yields and, in the third world, more malnutrition and famine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Downing of Oxford University's Environmental Change Unit, who recently edited a series of papers called ''Climate Change and World Food Security,'' singles out Sub-Saharan Africa as ''the most threatened'' region in terms of food security. There, ''adverse climatic variations'' are expected to combine with an already ''fragile environment, poor economic growth, (and) rapid population growth,'' he reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one is suggesting that the pollution can be stopped. Rather, at the 1992 Summit on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, 191 countries signed the Convention on Climate Change in which they made a commitment to keep carbon dioxide emissions at the 1990 level. The current round of negotiations are on how to do that. So far, $2 billion has been put forward by governments, via the Global Environmental Facility but experts say that will not even begin to address the problem. They estimate that the cost will be more like $200 billion and that can only be achieved with the participation of the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Convention recognizes that industries cannot pay the massive cost of reducing their emissions on their own. Overly strict regulations inhibit industrial growth, as would excessive taxes on polluters and the consensus is that a healthy environment and economic prosperity must go hand in hand. So negotiators have been trying to think up ingenious incentives that share the burden so that everyone can gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By turning the right to emit into stocks that governments can sell, poor, unindustrialised countries will probably have more stocks than they need and sell them off to industries in developed countries where there will likely be a shortage of stocks. Or also, the industries may provide anti-pollution technology to help poor countries reduce emissions caused by inefficient burning of fossil fuels and, in return, they can skim off some of the extra stocks for themselves. Beyond growing forests, joint implementation could also include the draining of wetlands, which could also lower carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, or various other actions that only indirectly reduce the emissions. An international body will be set up to judge each activity and credit the industry with the right to then emit a certain amount of pollution itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sokona makes the point that the carbon dioxide emitted from all of Sub- Saharan Africa is less than that of New York state and questions an approach that allows big industry to reduce the emissions of others so that it can keep pumping it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even advocates agree that joint implementation depends on the disparities between rich and poor countries but they say that if it is well negotiated it should not undermine poor countries attempts to produce food or industrialise.  Rather, they say, the plan will encourage the West to do what Africans have long been asking them to do -- invest in them. They say it is even possible that, in exchange for polluting, industries could get credit for assisting poor countries with actions that have little impact on carbon dioxide emissions such as alleviating poverty or improving health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Dr R. S. Maya, an expert at the Southern Centre in Zimbabwe, describes joint implementation as ''environmental colonialism.'' He warns that the plan could allow Western industries to grab all the cheap ways to reduce carbon dioxide while leaving mostly high cost options for the industrial late-comers in the third world. Maya also says that for Western companies to cheaply fulfill their obligations in joint implementation they could probably dumping unwanted or unproven technologies on the third world, and notes recent past experiences with Western companies dumping toxic waste in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent policy note prepared by the Norwegian Centre of International Climate and Energy Research in Oslo, disagrees, claiming that joint implementation could be the thing to stop Africa's growing marginalisation from the rest of the world. The region has had no major inter-regional trade agreements as has happened between Western powers and Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe and analysis of the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) suggests that Africa has missed out there too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Maya says he doubts that industrialised nations will suddenly have a ''change of heart'' in Africa. The world needs a dumping ground and Maya even suggests that joint implementation could be used as a way for Western companies to circumvent GATT's already weak anti-dumping regulations. He cites a pilot project Norway is currently implementing in Mexico that involves the manufacture and marketing of experimental, energy-efficient fluorescent lamps. In his view, the lamps are only marketable as long as they are subsidised, and in the meantime the project is undermining local production of conventional lamps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sokona also wonders whether big industries will be interested in joint implementation in Africa. ''They will want to reduce emissions in India and China, which have hugely inefficient industries, than working in Africa that has very little and that is also politically and economically unstable,'' he says. China is currently the third largest consumer of energy in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sokona admits that the privatisation schemes are the only way to reduce the so called greenhouse effect and says that the plan could work ''in theory''.  But in practice, African governments are ''over-burdened, under-staffed and inexperienced and do not have the capacity to think long term, '' he says.  ''Most are not even aware of the risks.'' Bilateral arrangements are expected to begin next year. ''When it proves cheap for rich countries and profitable in the short term for poor ones everyone will likely jump on the bandwagon,'' says Sokona.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A prominent Zambian law professor has called on Paris Club countries to take &quot;a strong stand on the question of democracy and &quot;maintain their aid squeeze&quot;on Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Muna Ndulo, formerly dean of the School of Law at the University of Zambia made the call ahead of the donors consultative meeting at the Paris Club next February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But nominated member of parliament Christopher Chawinga has dismissed Ndulo as a loud mouthed and unpatriotic Zambian who does not care about the poor people of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndulo observed that the November 18 elections &quot;cannot be free and fair&quot; and the holding of these elections &quot;will damage Zambia's image&quot; throughout the democratic world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope the donor countries will maintain their aid squeeze. It is important that the forthcoming annual Paris Club meeting on Zambia takes a very strong stand on the question of democracy in Zambia,&quot; writes Professor Ndulo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chawinga does not agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can a Zambian advocate such a bad thing for his country? Muna Ndulo ran away from this country and has not come back to develop it. He is content with his good education and does not care about poor Zambians who will suffer if Zambia is denied international aid&quot;, Chawinga said in an interview last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that Zambia did not deserve an aid squeeze as it has had the best democratic record on the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And AFRONET director Ngande Mwananjiti was non committal on the aid squeeze but said donors should consider matters of governance when they reviewed Zambia's position at the next Paris Club meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not want a situation where those in power do whatever they want. We also want human rights to be respected; so donors should be consistent with their earlier statements regarding democratic governance in Zambia,&quot; Mwananjiti said in an interview last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian law professor, who has also worked for the United Nations and is now with Cornell university in the United States of America however says the country has failed &quot;miserably&quot; to satisfy internationally accepted standards on elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The concept of 'free and fair' elections is about the entire electoral process and not about the conduct of voting on election day as many in the MMD seem to think,&quot; Ndulo writes, adding. &quot;The term 'free and fair' has attained a clear and precise meaning in international practice. It injects substance into the principle with regard to the right to democratic governance established by article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndulo, who lists six factors which must be satisfied if elections are to be internationally accepted as being free and fair, says the November 18 elections &quot;miserably&quot; failed to meet these standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cites lack of equal participation in standing for office caused by the 1996 constitution as one ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The amendments to the constitution are clearly discriminatory. They restrict the right of Zambians to stand for elective office of the president as well as restrict the right of traditional rulers to stand for elective political office and thereby deny their right to participate in the political life of the country,&quot; Ndulo writes pointing out that this is against article 26 of the Declaration of Human Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other grounds are lack of equal access &quot;to government controlled media as is the case in Zambia today. No one in Zambia, who is in their right mind, would deny that the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation, Zambia Daily Mail and the Times Of Zambia are partisan institutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nikuv voter registration too &quot;does not meet international standards&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In free and fair elections it is important that universal suffrage be the basis of the elections but universal suffrage is only one element of fairness.  Another is the concept of equal suffrage. This is the idea traditionally expressed in the phrase 'one person one vote'&quot;, Ndulo says, adding that the Nikuv register undermines these internationally accepted standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ndulo also examines the electoral commission and its members who must be appointed by consensus of &quot;the political parties contesting the elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There can be little doubt that the Zambian Elections Commission is partisan. It is not sufficient, as Justice Bwalya seems to think, that the law creating it says it is independent. This kind of analysis befits a villager and not a properly trained lawyer. It belongs to the world of the Sata's where fact and fiction are interchangeable,&quot; Ndulo says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That fact alone would never qualify a person for appointment to an electoral commission in any decent system. Is it any wonder that Justice Bwalya's reaction to the story of ghost voters on voters roll is not to promise investigation into the matter as any independent commission would do, but in true fashion of a partisan chairperson dismiss the allegations without any investigation,&quot; Ndulo says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Opposition Alliance has condemned plans by the ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) to hold a solidarity march to State House this Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The match has been called in support of the just ended elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the MMD has defended its right to hold the demonstration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alliance chairman Roger Chongwe said in an interview yesterday that the march was organised to &quot;hoodwink people of Zambia that President Chiluba was popularly elected&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the same thing Chiluba did when he signed the constitution. So this will also be an MMD affair,&quot; Chongwe said, in reference to a similar match in solidarity of Chiluba's assent to the controversial 1996 Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will not make people of this country recognise the Chiluba government as having been elected legitimately,&quot; Chongwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MMD have been running advertisements in both the print and electronic state media over the last week on the demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Minister of Science, Technology and Vocational Training Enoch Kavindele has defended his party's planned march saying MMD members also had a right to march whenever they saw the need to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have had no objections whenever the opposition have had their little marches even if these have not been successful, so I do not see any reason why our members cannot march when they feel there is a need to march,&quot; Kavindele said in an interview last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president Alfred Zulu advised the government to concentrate on resolving the problems in the entire electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The process of demonstrations and celebrations is not acceptable.What should happen now is to resolve the differences surrounding the elections,&quot; Zulu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the electoral process in terms of technicality was a total flop as a few Zambians participated in the elections because of omissions and other mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Solidarity with who because even the people who participated in the elections are saying they were fraudulent,&quot; Zulu asked.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A total of 6.2 million &quot;safe sex&quot; condoms have been sold this year alone and another 20 million dished out free by government, the distributors Zambia Social Marketing Project have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a liquid condom has been invented in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in an interview yesterday, director of contraceptive social marketing, Sanjay Changanti however bemoaned the contribution to safe sex being made by his organisation saying it was very negligible.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our objective is to provide affordable contraceptives and also to change people's attitudes.When you compare the sales to the number of condoms required you realise that we don't even manage to provide three condoms to all sexually active adults,&quot; Changati said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In view of this ZSMP has launched a month long study to ascertain the impact of its four year programme. ZSMP concentrates on condom use and behavioral changes among the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changati further said the study, depending on how people responded, would determine whether the Maximum Condom brand or packaging should be changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has taken us four years to build the identity of maximum which was after a lot of study,&quot; he said adding: &quot;But it would not be changed on frivolous grounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further disclosed that the government had also contributed largely to the distribution of condoms as it was giving out a total of 20 million condoms annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a South African company Condomania has produced a new Liquid condom called Liquidom which has to be applied to the male organ before copulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The condom takes five to seven minutes to apply the liquidom after which it immediately forms a protective sheath that shields against pregnancy and STDs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some Zambian men interviewed have shunned the liquidom saying it took too long to apply and this could spoil the sexual act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seven minutes is too long to pause during the act; I mean one could easily lose one's erection in that period,&quot; Nelson Siwale, a Lusaka accountant said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Lusaka businessman, Michael Chabwera said the liquidom would make the sexual act more awkward than the condom did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others believe the liquid is a risk too high to take in view of the HIV- AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liquid condom was invented by an Australian scientist and Condomania undertook to market it after carrying numerous successful tests on thousands of volunteers all over the world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - At least 500 hundred young women in Zambia are daily getting infected with the HIV virus that causes AIDS, disclosed Youth and Child Development deputy minister Mutale Chitika in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitika said this when she officially closed a week long National Youth Conference whose theme was: &quot;Behaviour Change, An Essential Strategy to the fight Against HIV/AIDS&quot; at the University of Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And other statistics made available to the delegates to the conference on HIV/AIDS indicate that in the age group of 15- 39 there are about 700,000 people in Zambia infected with the HIV virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the Zambian population has about 70 per cent youths who are at great risk of contracting the HIV/AIDS and need protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is therefore a matter of utmost importance and greatest urgency that the young are protected from this deadly disease AIDS. The spread of HIV/AIDS however seems to be on the increase especially among young women with an estimated infection rate of 500 or so new cases per day,'' Chitika said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is therefore imperative that the youth are assisted to understand this disease and to develop heathy living habits,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitika called on the youths to discuss and reach a consensus on how to deal with the disease in a manner which is meaningful and acceptable to all young people and look at abstinence as a means of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a youth delegate Brill Edwards urged the youths to change behaviour as it is the most essential strategy to fight HIV/AIDS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Human Rights Watch/Africa today called on the Tanzanian government and UNHCR to stop forcing the Rwandan refugees to repatriate and to lift their demand that all Rwandan refugees return by December 31, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights organization stated that the reported use of teargas and sticks by Tanzanian authorities to herd refugees towards the border is coercion which violates international refugee law. Moreover, the decision to apply an arbitrary deadline to all refugees without distinction takes no account of persecution of legitimate refugees. In addition, the Tanzanian government has restricted all access to the camps, lending credence to reports of intimidation being used indiscriminately against refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Tanzanian government's use of force to drive Rwandan refugees over the border is a blot on their traditionally good record in respect of refugee rights,&quot; noted Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch/Africa. &quot;Moreover, the United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) has shamefully abandoned its responsibility to protect refugees.&quot; This is the third instance this year of forced repatriation of Rwandan refugees that UNHCR and the international community have watched with little protest. In July and August, Burundi forcibly returned some 80,000 Rwandan refugees, and in October and November, the Rwandan refugee camps in eastern Zaire were forcibly dispersed by Zairian rebel groups, with the support of the Rwandan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee camps in Tanzania and in Zaire have been under the control of the former Rwandan army and militia, which have launched military incursions over the border into Rwanda as well as used terror and force to prevent voluntary repatriation. Since the refugee camps were created over two years ago, the international community has never been willing to devote the necessary political or financial resources to screen out combatants or those suspected of genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under refugee law, those suspected of genocide and crimes against humanity, like those involved in military activity against their home government, have no right to the status of refugee and should have been excluded from such status. Had the international community provided the necessary assistance to undertake such a task at the outset, then those who wished to return could have done so and legitimate refugees would have been assured of the protection promised by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community has barely disguised its satisfaction at seeing the refugee camps around Rwanda forcibly disbanded. But merely moving the refugees from one side of the border to the other will not offer any lasting solution without justice for genocide victims and improved respect for human rights by the Rwandan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan judiciary is still not functioning, over two years later, and over 85,000 prisoners are being held in inhumane conditions without trial.  The government must begin trials of those accused of genocide and provide concrete information about the proceedings. To address refugee fears of attacks by the Rwandan military once they return to their home communes, the government must acknowledge and condemn killings by the military and begin investigation and prosecution of those responsible. The government has scheduled a court martial of Col. Fred Ibingira for December 19 in connection with the killing of displaced persons in Kibeho in April 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fair and rigorous trial would reassure refugees and demonstrate to the international community its commitment to bring to justice soldiers responsible for human rights abuses. Returning refugees also fear that they will have no home or no fields to plant if they return. Legitimate fears exists that they may be imprisoned on false charges of genocide if they attempt to regain their occupied property. The government must take steps to ensure that property disputes are dealt with equitably and fairly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those legitimate refugees who choose to remain in Tanzania must be provided with protection and assistance by UNHCR. Simultaneously, the international community must provide the funds needed by the United Nations Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda to continue long-term monitoring of the refugees who have returned to Rwanda. Whatever the cost of this operation, it is far less than what would be needed to provide continuing assistance for people too fearful of persecution to return home. The international community must also renew its commitment to bring perpetrators of genocide to book under the jurisdiction of the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which was created in 1994 to hold genocide perpetrators accountable in an international procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RECOMMENDATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Government of Tanzania:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately end the use of force against Rwandan refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lift the arbitrary return deadline of December 31, 1996 for all Rwandan refugees to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Permit journalists and other observers access to areas around the refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guarantee protection to legitimate refugees to remain in Tanzania and permit international humanitarian organizations to provide relief to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the International Community:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guarantee the right of legitimate refugees to protection from forcible repatriation and ensure that humanitarian supplies are provided in Tanzania and Zaire for those legitimate refugees who decide not to return to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Institute screening procedures to exclude from refugee status any combatants or those suspected of genocide or crimes against humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressure the Tanzanian government to ensure that returning refugees are protected from coercion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressure the Rwandan government to continue to ensure the rights of returning refugees and to put the judicial system into operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provide financial and political support for the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provide the resources necessary for the resettlement of all refugees, whether the old case load or those recently returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Government of Rwanda:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensure that full protection of the law is assured to all Rwandans, including those refugees who have just returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Begin the trials of those accused of genocide and provide concrete information about the proceedings and provisions being made for defense counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acknowledge and condemn killings by the military and immediately begin investigation and prosecution of those responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensure that resources for resettlement are fairly and equitably used to resettle all refugees, whether the old case load or those recently returned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Text of statement by President Clinton on the election of Kofi Annan of Ghana as the new secretary general of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm delighted by today's vote in the United Nations Security Council, selecting Kofi Annan of Ghana to be the new UN Secretary General. We are hopeful that the General Assembly will concur with the Security Council early next week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through his decades of work at the United Nations and in the international arena, Kofi Annan has established excellent working relations with many countries, including the United States. Over the last four years as UN Undersecretary for Peacekeeping, and throughout his impressive career, he has proven himself an able and energetic manager -- professional, impartial, well- versed in the issues at hand, and a true proponent of reform. We are confident he will take concrete steps to inspire the world to support the UN, inspire the UN to live up to its ideals, and transform those ideals into action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its founding more than half a century ago, the United Nations has been a vehicle for peace and progress that has served the interests of America and the world. Since taking office, I have worked hard with Congress to sustain America's support for the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Precisely because we believe in the United Nations, my Administration has also led the fight for far-reaching UN reform. To meet the challenges of the 21st century, the UN must keep pace with the times -achieving its work with fewer people and resources, reducing waste and rationalizing priorities, and producing better results at lower costs. The world community needs a United Nations that spends less on overhead and outdated agencies and more on services that directly benefit people's daily lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe the United Nations must have a leader who is committed to these goals. That is why I decided we needed a new Secretary General. I knew this would be a controversial decision, but it was the right thing to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outgoing UN Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, is an honorable man who has led a great career -- from the breakthrough for Middle East peace at Camp David to his leadership of the United Nations as it celebrated its 50th anniversary. Now, we must prepare the United Nations for the demands of the next 50 years. I am confident Kofi Annan will rise to this task with conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am committed to work closely with the Congress to meet America's obligations to the United Nations and to make good on our arrears. And I am sure that my nominee for our UN Ambassador, Bill Richardson, will work effectively with the new Secretary General to renew and revitalize this historic organization to take on the challenges of the future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The Republic of China, or Taiwan, has suspended air links with South Africa, in retaliation against Pretoria's decision to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing from the end of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials announced Monday in Johannesburg and in Taipei that South African Airways (SAA) had been ordered to stop flying to Taipei from Feb. 15, 1997.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We give SAA two months to prepare to stop flights. But the flights can resume once we have achieved a satisfactory framework for our future ties,&quot; Taiwan Foreign Minister Chang Hsiao-Yen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirming this Tuesday, a SAA spokesman said the company was studying the relevant documentation. The normal cancellation period for landing rights was 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman added that passengers would soon be informed about the implications of the decision to suspend air links. At the moment SAA operates two flights a week from Johannesburg to Taipei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The air pact is the first of a total of 26 government treaties with South Africa that Taiwan is suspending. It is also ending 17 cooperation projects worth almost 4.5 billion U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiwan has also recalled its ambassador to South Africa -- I-Cheng Loh. He left Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his departure, he told the media that he hoped to return to South Africa in 1997 to take part in negotiations aimed at developing a framework for future relations between the two countries.</SPAN></P>

The force, headquartered in Kampala, was initially meant to ensure delivery of food supplies to Rwandan refugees in war-torn eastern Zaire, until March 1997. While Uganda welcomed the mission, Rwanda and Zaire expressed reservations about its role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The multinational force headquarters in Kampala said Canada informed the United Nations that it believed that the military mission was &quot;no longer the most appropriate means to address the humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada's decision to return its troops home was based on the report of the first-hand assessment presented to the steering group by the commander of multinational force, Lt. Gen. Maurice Baril of Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baril was quoted as saying that the force's mission to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid had been overtaken by the voluntary return of Rwandan refugees. He said that humanitarian relief agencies and local authorities could help refugees who remain in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada's focus will now shift to coordinating international efforts under civilian leadership, which it believes will resolve to address the political problems in the central African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baril said that Uganda had given &quot;outstanding support&quot; to the multinational force during its one-month stay in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - African leaders have set up a four-man committee from among their number to work out ways to end fighting in the Great Lakes region in East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders meet Monday in Nairobi to review the situation in the region and chose the presidents of Cameroon, Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa to spearhead the peace mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe attended the Great Lakes summit for the first time in his capacity as the chairman of the Southern African Development Community organ on Politics, Defence and Security. South African President Nelson Mandela attended as the community's chairman.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe told journalists on his return to Harare that the committee would include the secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity, Salim Ahmed Salim. Mugabe said that Salim would contact leaders in the directly concerned with the crisis with a view to finding a lasting end to the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should get into action as soon as circumstances allow,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that one of the leaders who will be consulted is Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko, who arrived in Kinshasa Tuesday after prolonged treatment in Switzerland for prostrate cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire has boycotted both summits on the crisis as his parliament has passed a law forbidding participation in any meetings for as long as part of the country was occupied by &quot;foreign forces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said while some Western countries, particularly the United States, had their own ideas about handling the situation in the region, regional players still held the key to achieving peace and stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee has been set up at a time when political analysts say Zaire is building up its forces to counter the offensive by Tutsi-led Zairian rebels who have conquered a substantial part of eastern part of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time Kinshasa has accused Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda of supporting the rebels, known as the Banyamurenge. The anti-government forces have intensified their offensive and are reportedly determined to topple the Kinshasa government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu has been recovering in France from a prostrate cancer operation in Switzerland Aug. 22.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA, Zaire (PANA) - Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko returned home to Kinshasa Thursday amid high expectations that he would end the rebellion that has engulfed most of his country's east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu is expected to make a nationwide radio and television address later in the day, officials in the president's office said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expected to announce a new army chief of staff, ways he intends to deal with the rebellion and methods by which Zaire can complete the country's long transition to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu flew home from France where he was recuperating after surgery four months ago for prostrate cancer, in a Swiss clinic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his absence, fighting erupted between the Zairian army and Zairian Tutsi anti-government forces known as the Banyamulenge, or Banyamurenge.  These anti-government forces have been resisting expulsion from the country where they have lived for some 200 years. The fighting has led to a massive flight of Hutu refugees from eastern Zaire to Rwanda. Hutu refugees initially fled their country after Tutsi-led forces defeated the largely Hutu-led government in Kigali following the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, thousands of Zairians have also been displaced in the rebellion- affected Kivu province.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - Algeria has announced a ban on the use of the French language in the country's administration and other public sectors. The measure becomes effective July 5, 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Algerian Transitional Council adopted on Tuesday the decree banning French in two years and calling for the widespread use of Arabic in this former French colony.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Council has given Algerian universities until July 5, 2000 when they must switch to teaching only in Arabic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban on French is part of the Arabization policy adopted after the country's independence from France on July 5, 1962.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, implementation of this decision has had to be abandoned several times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, in 1994 the decree was suspended due to the conflict between Arabophils and Francophils. The struggle between these two groups for linguistic dominance has still not abated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decree was adopted the same day the Ministerial Conference of French- speaking Countries began their meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of Arabic should be widespread by July 5, 1998 and by July 5, 2000 it should be compulsory in all the political, economic and social sectors in Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter no political statement, speech, or correspondence can be in French neither can any conference or lecture be given in this language.  Television programmes and oral communications will be made in Arabic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any public official writing documents in a language other than Arabic -- apart from contracts with international firms -- will be liable to a fine of 5,000 dinars (about 90 US dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is uncertain to what degree Algerians will heed this edict, although some 75 percent of the country's 26.6 million people are Arabs. Algerians have failed to obey orders to conduct government business exclusively in Arabic over the past 34 years. Moreover, some 25 percent of the population are Berbers who want their language, the indigenous language, to be given greater official recognition by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some opposition parties see the decree as a concession by President Liamine Zeroual to militant Moslem groups. The country has been embroiled in violence between the secular government and radical Moslem organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new decree also makes provision for the creation of a High Council for Arabic Language chaired by the Algerian head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a similar move, the present French government of Prime Minister Jacque Touvon has passed a law compelling radio stations in the country to play a certain percentage of their music in French and not English. French ultra- nationalists have been complaining that too many English words were in current use in French.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, despite or because of its former French colonial status, Algeria has said that English, and not French, will be the first and most important foreign language taught in its schools.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measure followed a revolt Tuesday by players of the national soccer team players, who abandoned their camp in the capital in protest against unpaid allowances.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team had just returned from Kenya where it played two friendly matches against that country's national soccer side.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miyanda said at his news conference that he had ordered fresh elections early in 1997 for a fully-fledged National Executive Committee of the association. It will replace the current interim body.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Those who live in glass houses should not through stones, ZNBC advised its former director of programmes, Frank Mutubila, in a letter to The Post yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZNBC public relations manager, Keith Nalumango, yesterday warned Mutubila not to throw stones at the corporation because he himself lived in a glass house and advised him to keep the organisation out of talk about his departure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nalumango was reacting to an article in the Monday edition of The Post which quoted Mutubila as saying the programmes he produced for the station earned ZNBC K54 million per quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your readers may surely wish to know what professional differences Mr Mutubila had with his employers. They will also be interested to know that the corporation makes much more than K54 million per quarter and that no one at ZNBC has claimed individual success for this, for all corporation programmes are the result of collective staff efforts,&quot; Nalumango said, adding: &quot;Management would like to advise Mr Mutubila to desist from dragging the Corporation into a public debate over his departure from the corporation as this would not help matters. People who live in glass houses should not throw stones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to get Mutubila to comment on the letter from management last night failed as his residential telephone was constantly engaged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Group Executive director Molly Mwafulilwa said in an interview yesterday that the Women Lobby Group reached its conclusion after carefully analysing all circumstances prior to and after the elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The November 18 elections can not be declared free and fair because the whole electoral process was fraudulent, some prominent aspiring candidates were eliminated from the race by the constitution, the state media coverage was biased towards the ruling party, campaign activities were so unbalanced and time given to participants to campaign was so short,&quot; Mwafulilwa said. &quot; The voting day was generally peaceful but after considering all circumstances leading to the elections there is no way you can say that the elections were free and fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mwafulilwa whose organisation held a forum last week to analyse the performance of women candidates in the last elections said the lobby will support all women who want to petition against the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are supporting the issue of petitioning against the elections because most of the people who lost feel that they were unfairly treated,&quot; Mwafulilwa said adding: &quot; We shall encourage and support all women losing candidates who want to seek court redress on the principle that their rights were violated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Women Lobby becomes the fourth Non-governmental Organisation to declare the November elections not free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP), Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) and Committee for Clean Campaign (CCC) also declared the polls not free and fair citing a fraudulent electoral process, political differences prior to the elections and various other malpractices.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The return to Zaire of President Mobutu Sese Seko should give impectus to the search for a solution to the armed insurrection in Eastern Zaire.His prolonged absence created a void which was probably a factor in the rebel's decision to take up arms and left the authorities in Kinshasa humstrung, unable to take strong action or clear initiatives on the problem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu's return should change all that. He undoubtedly will have to provide leadership and work to bring to an end the insurrection. The issue is undoubtedly emotive, no country would watch its territory dismembered with arms folded yet a violent response or one merely aimed at regaining lost territory may not necessarily be the best. There is need for a more considered approach.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African countries cannot afford wars not just because of the drain on meagre resources but largely also because there has been enough slaughter of and suffering among the civilian population as a result of such wars. Many of them have in any case been the result of individual ambitions and not the popular will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ordinary people in eastern Zaire will again be the losers if the problem is approached in the old way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hardly reassuring however that the Zairean government through its Information minister is already seeing conspirancies against that country in meetings that concerned African leaders have held to try and find ways out of the impasse. The suggestion that English speaking African countries do not have the interest of French -speaking Africans can only please those quarters bent on dividing Africa. It is pretty omnious too coming as it does shortly after another display of the same attitude in the election of a new Secretary- General of the United Nations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It does seem as though a new era of Africa being a pawn in other peoples games is beginning to the detriment of the continent.There should really be nothing controvesial about African countries whether French or English speaking meeting to discuss a problem of the proportions of the Great Lakes region one. Such meetings in fact should be a source of hope that African, and therefore hopefully more realistic, solutions will be found.The contest betweeen French and English speaking areas seems out of place .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Zaire would be disabused of this notion or at least have a clearer view of the motivations of its sister countries if it attended instead of boycotting such meetings. Zaire has consistently stayed away. Despite the emotive nature of the issue, there is a definite place and role for Zaire which is the aggrieved party .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly her participation even as an observer can help eliminate lingering suspicions about the true purpose and spirit of the meetings. Her present stance can only frustrate what can turn out to be constructive African initiatives and serve as invitation to some quarters who may still not be averse to using the continent as a pawn in their contest for spheres of influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is an African one and attempts to create a certain consensus among concerned African countries could be the best source of realistic peace initiatives. The involvement of African countries should therefore not be discouraged or looked down upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, with the return of the Zairean leader that country's attitude and policies towards the problem should crystallise and they should be better founded than the mere belief that English speaking Africa is conspiring against the French speaking countries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The problem is real. The Rebels in Eastern Zaire are in control of a sizeable part of the country and efforts to dislodge them have so far not succeeded and they have certainly had time to consolidate their military hold on the area. So even by military means it is a by no means easy problem to solve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a real problem requiring considered approaches. Zaire will need to widen and not narrow down consultations on the matter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Unexpectedly, two former presidents, Amdmiral Didier Ratsiraka and Prof. Albert Zafy, will again compete to lead Malagasy as they did in 1993. But this time round, the former military ruler is most likely to recapture the highest office and have his revenge. If elected, he promises a new constitution. But then the whole democratization process will have to be started from scratch again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final round of the early presidential elections in Madagascar is due on December 29, 1996, pitting former military ruler Admiral Didier Ratsiraka against his immediate successor, former president Prof. Albert Zafy.  Campaigns began earnestly on the island on December 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The date was announced in the capital, Antananarivo, at the end of a cabinet meeting held on December 5 after the High Constitutional Court (HCC) rejected a government request that the elections be delayed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two former presidents emerged with the largest number of votes but without the required absolute majority from the first ballot held on November 3. Ratsiraka led with 36 per cent, followed by Zafy with 23 per cent in the race that attracted 15 presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The early presidential elections were convened after Albert Zafy was impeached in September by the Parliament on the ground that he had violated the constitution on several occasions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already in 1993, the two men were the final contenders of another early presidential election prompted by popular demand for a more democratic regime.  Zafy, then backed by a large section of the Malagasy political community, civil society and Church, won against Ratsiraka, thereby reviving hope for a better life in an impoverished country where mere survival is, in certain areas, a real achievement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unlike in 1993, Ratsiraka has this time round in front of him not only a weakened and less popular Zafy but also a divided and hesitant front of potential opponents left, with little time to re- unite again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed Zafy was impeached not only by opposition members (most of them hostile to Ratsiraka too) but also by some of his staunchest supporters who accused him of favouring his own political party at the expense of th other political factions which brought him to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, they have now some difficulties in backing Zafy openly and sincerely again - three months only after ousting him - without undermining badly their own credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Church, which was instrumental in the country's transition to a democratic era that brought the same Zafy to power, seems to have decided now to confine itself strictly to its prophetic role and has kept a lower profile during the current developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zafy's poor economic performances and perceived offhand way of handling national affairs (He was widely criticized for being evasive in major issues), seem to have alienated almost half of his voters. Indeed in a similar first ballot in 1992, he won 45 per cent while now he is left with only 23 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political observers say very complex negotiations and manoeuvres are in fact under way behind the scenes in the Malagasy capital, to counter Ratsiraka's bid to return to power. But the anti-Ratsiraka coalition which brought Zafy to power in 1993, divided by factional interests and short-term gains after the fall of the common enemy, is not likely to rebuild and demonstrate in less than a month's time, the same unity which took them two years to build a few years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless, of course, they come up with a &quot;shortcut&quot;. One of such shortcuts and which is reported to be currently envisaged by a section of anti- Ratsiraka politicians as an ultimate weapon is to prevent the former military ruler from running December 29 final round on health-related grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some time, persistent rumours were circulating that Ratsiraka, who was in France for medical reasons, had become blind. But against all expectations and political calculations, he cut short his stay in France after 18 months and returned home to stand for the early presidential elections. The rumours in question proved to be unfounded until Malagasy urban voters were puzzled to watch the man, on their television screens, having real difficulties in putting his ballot paper in the ballot box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that was already after the closure of the polling stations and Ratsiraka had by then already gathered his decisive 36 per cent of the votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the former military ruler has continued to gather more support.  Herizo Razafimahaleo, the rising star of the Malagasy business and political communities and ranked third with 15 per cent of the votes in the first ballot of the current early presidential elections, decided to back him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aged 41, wealthy, competent, popular among the youth and relatively experienced (he was a former economic adviser to Ratsiraka and an industry minister of Zafy), his declared support to Ratsiraka was a deadly blow to Zafy's camp, causing its first cracks followed by the series of spectacular defections and U-turns which have always characterized the behaviour of Malagasy politicians in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, driven by a sort of blind survival instinct, most of Malagasy political party leaders, regardless of whatever principles or ideologies they have been professing or preaching, would at one time unscrupulously disown everything to join the winning camp, believing (with some reason probably) that the only way to survive as a career politician in this country, is first to remain at any cost, part of the ruling clique or the leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The game has become so cynical that most of major political parties usually end up being split in two at each trying time -- one faction becoming part of the leadership and another faction remaining in the &quot;opposition&quot; until better times prompt them to &quot;reconcile&quot; pompously later on. The acrobatic feat was once described perfectly by a local journalist as the &quot;politics of presence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For nearly two decades now, Malagasy political party leaders have played this sort of game in a very subtle and crafty manner. But the trick has begun to run out of steam. In voting for the two former presidents, Malagasy voters, in a way, showed that they were tired of zigzaging and unprincipled politicians. And that they craved now for &quot;principled&quot; politicians, who are more loyal to themselves and the people they are supposed to serve, no matter how &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;incompetent&quot; they had been in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A profile which, to a certain extent, fits both Ratsiraka and Zafy. And this is precisely the underlying reason for the unexpected resurfacing of the two former presidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the case however, whether Ratsiraka or Zafy (or perhaps another candidate should Ratsiraka be disqualified on health grounds) is to become the next Malagasy president, the whole democratization process initiated painfully with the adoption of a new constitution in 1992 will have to be started from scratch again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed Ratsiraka, blaming all the current problems in Madagascar on an inadequate constitution, promised, if elected, to submit at least two types of constitution for referendum: a unitary and a federal one. While Zafy, for his part, will not fail to approve major &quot;improvements&quot; to the present constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both cases, a &quot;new&quot; constitution therefore has to emerge. Which supposes another lengthy and costly process including the adoption of either the new or amended constitution, the establishment of the ensuing institutions through a series of elections and time- consuming political squabblings, bargainings and compromises driven by the dynamics of the very &quot;politics of presence&quot; described earlier on, not to mention the unavoidable subsequent informal &quot;transitional&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; phases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In brief, it may take at least another two or three years again before this Indian Ocean island can perhaps fully fulfil its potential of a major touristic destination and foreign investment haven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, things seem to happen as if the one-step-forward-two-steps- backward tempo has always been a permanent feature of the contemporary history of the peace-loving but a little too perfectionist Malagasy people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another regular retarding factor is the series of cyclones which claim their heavy toll annually, especially at this particular period of the year.</SPAN></P>

But for a seven- year-old boy (whose identity will remain anonymous), it is time for yet another nightmare - he has to share the same plate with the family dog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between September 1994 and July 1995, the boy's father Gedeon Munyanyi (37) and stepmother Abigail Dzangare of Chief Ndang's area in Shurugwi, central Zimbabwe, repeatedly assaulted him with sticks and open hands. His stepmother also forced him to eat from the same plate with the family dog.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A concerned neighbour alerted authorities of the continued abuse and the two were arrested and sentenced to 15 months in jail, five of which were conditionally suspended for five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the plight of many who are under the care of step-parents. They are subjected to all kinds of physical, emotional and at times even sexual abuse by the step-parents who are supposed to be looking after them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cases of child abuse have come to light over the past few years, with the Child Protection Society in Zimbabwe saying it now gets at least five reports every week. However, the reported incidences &quot;are just a tip of the iceberg&quot; as most cases go unreported mainly because the perpetrators are related to the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only a very small fraction of the cases are reported to us because of the cultural connotations where the perpetrator is related to the victim. More than half of the cases of physical or sexual abuse occur between very closely knit families...child abusers are rarely outsiders. This makes it difficult for anybody to report and unless concerned neighbours do so, the perpetrators continue abusing the child without being brought to justice,&quot; says the chairman of the Child Protection Society, Mr. Percy Molife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in spite of the fact that the society was given more powers to intervene in such cases following the amendment of Zimbabwe's Child Protection and Adoption Act. This was after the controversy a decade ago, when the society under the chairmanship of the late Willie Musarurwa took away a girl who had been &quot;given&quot; as payment of ngozi (evil spirits of a deceased person) in Murewa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child abuse comes in two main forms, the common and perhaps widely perpetrated physical abuse and the now prevalent sexual abuse, which was the subject of a recent world congress against the commercial sexual exploitation of children in Sweden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, psychologists say both abuses lead to emotional upheaval that leaves permanent scars on the victim. These children, they say, later become abusers as adults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poverty, which has been worsened by growing economic difficulties, now results in some parents &quot;taking out the steam&quot; by beating up or abusing their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Transferred aggression is now a common phenomenon in most families.  Although there are various causes of child abuse, the overriding one is that somewhere in the home there is unhappiness. It could be because of poverty, marital problems between husband and wife, or relationships with extended family members. Victims do not come out of a vacuum, they come from a home or a situation where you should find a home but do not because the home is in disarray,&quot; said a psychologist, Dr. Tommie-Marie Samkange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With divorce cases soaring due to various socio-economic factors like the breakdown of the family unit, many second marriages have emerged with children being caught up in the middle. As a result, stepmothers are taking care of the children from another marriage, usually after the father wins custody of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research has revealed that most children under the care of stepmothers suffer untold hardships. Stepmothers have been accused of denying stepsons/daughters basic needs like food and clothing. In other cases, the stepchild is expected to supplement the family income by vending. Some stepsons have attended school in tattered and torn clothes. Children who grow under the care of stepmothers equate their ordeal to &quot;that of a prison&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember it was friends and fellow students who would give me food at school after coming to school on an empty stomach. I worked twice as hard, and more clothes were given to me as gifts by relatives while my stepmother's blood children enjoyed every care and attention,&quot; said a victim of child abuse, who is now a secretary with a private doctor in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But like many others, she could not report the abuse to her father. The few times that she tried it led to verbal scolding and at worst heavy beating.  Hence, people are getting away with extremes of child abuse, a situation that psychologists say creates a fatal vicious cycle since research has established that most child abusers have at one time in their lives been victims of abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in most cases, women's organizations and activists see 'red' the moment the subject is raised, saying that instead of taking a holistic approach, society points accusing fingers at stepmothers alone, &quot;who are surviving against all odds in a stressful environment that perpetuates violence and aggression&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official of the Women's Action Group said stepmothers were not the issue.  She said such mothers were toiling looking after stepsons and even if they discipline the child in good faith &quot;people will always be over-critical of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, one women's organization did research which corroborates the sentiments that stepmothers abuse their stepchildren. But the organization has refused to have the findings made public &quot;as they will cause chaos and despondency in society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Tsitsi Nzira of the Women and Law in Southern Africa Research Trust: &quot; What concerns us is the issue of painting stepmothers as evil...There is more to this topic and people should not base their judgement on the few reported cases. While we do not condone the problem, several questions have to be asked, like what was the role of the father? Was he providing enough food? Our research has revealed that the child is better off left in the care of his real mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see men are worsening the problem because they do not want to pay maintenance for their children and therefore apply for custody, but leave the children at the mercy of the stepmother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zimbabwean society, children in the custody of their mother from a previous marriage are labelled illegitimate (mubvandiripo). Thus traditionally on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remarrying, this woman in some cases refuses to take her children to her new home. Others will identify their child as a young sister, or their sister's child, for them to be accepted into the marriage. In most cases the children are left in the care of grandparents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is where the mother will abuse the stepchildren because you will be expecting too much from her. Surely, how can I be nice to someone else's children, when mine are probably suffering? You can't expect her to have automatic bonding; it can only come if the marital relationship is pure or problem free, which in most cases never happens,&quot; said Nzira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cultural view that children were an investment, and the tradition that they would look after their parents after landing good jobs, has brought in the factor of personal interest. Some stepmothers mistreat stepchildren on the belief that they will turn against them when they become adults, and then remember their real mothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is our perennial fear. You see a child never forgets his/her real mother no matter what. After nurturing a stepson, doing everything for him, it pains you when he resorts to his biological mother,&quot; said Mrs. Irene Sibanda, who is taking care of a stepson Chitungwiza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as society trades counter accusations, the Department of Social Welfare in Zimbabwe carries the burden of dealing with victims of child abuse, and taking care of individual cases either financially or morally. The department refers scores of cases to children's homes and where necessary, the police.  At the homes, the department pays a certain amount towards the upkeep of that child, spending millions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Nzira had a point when she suggested that a national or even continental conference on child abuse should be convened urgently where solutions to the growing problems will be mooted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Salvador, Brazil's north-eastern coastal city, recently hosted one of the most significant conventions in the ecumenical movement. African churches represented at the meeting highlighted several issues that concern Christians in the continent, as reported by APS Writer Wanjugu Mumia who participated in the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against a multi-cultural background and a challenging theme, Called to One Hope, the Gospel in Diverse Cultures, the 11th conference on World Mission and Evangelism (CWME) from November 24 to December 23 brought together member churches of the World Council of Churches (WCC) to discuss the meaning and role of mission in diverse cultural settings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the key endeavours of the conference was to provide input into a new ecumenical statement on the churches' calling to mission and evangelism. A text of the statement is expected to be presented to the WCC Central Committee in September 1997 and to the Eighth WCC Assembly to be held in Harare, Zimbabwe in September 1998.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new statement would supplement the landmark document, Mission and Evangelism: An Ecumenical Affirmation, adopted by the WCC Central Committee in 1982, after intensive consultation with member churches and related mission boards and agencies as well as Roman Catholic and Evangelical theologians and missionaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1982 statement explores seven elements of an ecumenical perception of Christian mission namely, the call to conversion, the church's right and obligation to witness to the Lordship of Christ in all realms of life, unity in mission, mission in Christ's way, the Gospel as good news to the poor, the fact that mission is addressed to every part of the world and witness among people of living faiths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the new statement would have to acknowledge that events and trends since its adoption in the early 1980s have clearly created a new context for Christian mission. These include political upheavals in Eastern Europe, the end of apartheid in South Africa, and the outbreak of numerous conflicts worldwide and Africa in particular due to resurgent ethnic identity, among other concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to the plenary discussion on the new WCC Mission Statement, Kenyan Methodist pastor and youth representative, Mary Nkirote Mwirabua, informed the CWME delegates that the church in Africa is taking seriously mission and evangelism, particularly through the formation of missionary associations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, she noted, the number of Africans sent outside the continent to do missionary work is very small, whereas many foreigners come to Africa as missionaries, &quot;hence the perception that mission is accomplished when people come from foreign lands as opposed to the same work being done by local people themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emphasizing a concern voiced in other group and plenary discussions, Rev.  Nkirote told the CWME meeting to bear in mind the psychological attitude brought about by the way in which the early missionaries presented Christianity to Africans. &quot;They undermined the African culture, hence detaching themselves from people they were evangelising,&quot; she explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, one should keep in mind one factor according to Rev. Nkirote; &quot; Africans never lost hope in the good news because they were convinced one could be a Christian without denouncing one's culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guided by the theme of the conference, Called to One Hope -- The Gospel in Diverse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cultures, the Kenyan Methodist clergy said that involvement in mission requires the church to work in solidarity not only with its own members but those of Christian denominations that may differ in styles of thought, customs and theologies among others. &quot;Through our own solidarity and similar collaboration with others, we are able to share together cultural and human strengths to attain life in its fullness,&quot; she explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She cited one of the characteristics of the church as sharing gifts, saying this should be emulated in order to strengthen the work of Christ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with APS after her presentation, Rev. Nkirote pointed out that generally, Africans have allowed forces of division to dominate amongst them because they often fail to speak with one voice, even though their concerns are similar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that much as Africa was awash with problems, there was still hope in the one Gospel of Jesus Christ as evidenced in the growth of Christianity in many countries in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acknowledging that the church faces many challenges especially when one looks at the fate of innocent human beings caught up in civil wars in Burundi, Rwanda, Sudan, Somalia, Liberia and other countries, Rev. Nkirote said the church needs to critically address its mission so as to continue to involve its members in the process of enhancing peaceful co-existence in societies representing diverse cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a press conference here, Rev. Samuel Adoa of the Presbyterian Church in the Sudan, welcomed the hosting of the CWME, but raised concern that the conference had not set a task to address the frustrating issues affecting the people in the South generally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited his own country Sudan, where civil war for the last 13 years had caused untold suffering to the people despite appeals by churches for intervention. Rev. Adoa said he expected the just ended conference to address strongly the issues that &quot;are consuming many people of our nations...That this conference would influence our nations and their partners in trade to come to their senses on the sale and purchase of arms, whose consequences are seriously affecting displaced and hungry people in our regions. But this seems not to have been the case,&quot; he told APS in an interview here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Adoa's opinion was not necessarily shared by all other participants from the South. Some felt the mandate of the CWME was to address the concept of gospel and culture and not provide answers to concerns such as the one the Sudanese delegate had raised. He however emphasized in the interview with APS that the Christians and other people in Sudan would be interested to know what major commitment the meeting had made to their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that people from different cultures all over the world can meet in Brazil, a place of diverse cultures and religions, is in its own way a success, but I do not feel the issues that affect members of the churches at home, fellow Sudanese, and other Africans on a daily basis, were given the adequate attention in this conference,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Ms. D. Namwembe from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Uganda, the message based on theme of the conference was challenging, but she hoped that even in a small way, the outcome of the CWME would help in the process of bringing peace to her home in northern Uganda, an area wracked by insurrection by rebel soldiers fighting the government of President Yoweri Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A youth delegate, Namwembe said even in a war situation, the youth in this East African country are exposed to the various challenges facing young people in a global context. She was however concerned that the youth seem caught up between two worlds -- that of a Western culture that they cannot run away from and identify within their own cultures &quot;which seem not to accommodate or understand them anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another youth delegate Mr. Ntsane Moriana from the Lesotho Evangelical Church said there are many issues suppressing the youth today especially in developing countries where the young people are marginalised in decision making processes that would otherwise contribute to their individual and communal development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the place of the youth in the church, Moriana said in their encontro (detailed presentation), the youth presented a true picture on how young people all over the world are affected by developments they have little control over and how they turn to the church to seek answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a colourful show by some of the 76 youth delegates at the meeting, one issue that came out strongly was the influence of globalisation on the young people, irrespective of whether they came from the North or South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through presentations that symbolized the &quot;jeans and T-shirt&quot; and &quot;Coca Cola culture&quot; overtaking young persons worldwide, youth delegates to the CWME meeting argued that they were becoming more and more removed from their cultural settings and identities but also challenged the church that it cannot run away from the fact that modern day communication and transport technology is turning the world into &quot;a global village.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter what, globalisation cannot be avoided. Everyday the world is moving closer to being a global village, but at the same time marginalising more and more people who cannot afford to keep up with the modern communication technology and computer age that is synonymous with globalisation,&quot; Moriana told APS in an interview here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much as the youth from Lesotho is convinced there is hope in the one Gospel of Jesus Christ, he challenged young people particularly to work as a team in the local, national and international levels in order to seek ways in which they can influence the various authorities to meet their needs in a world where trends are changing very fast. He however noted that this is the same world that has youth playing soldiers and child soldiers in civil wars in countries like Sudan, Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia and northern Uganda among other nations in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mrs Raga Bereberei from the Episcopal Church of the Sudan, the Brazil conference was an enriching encounter that exposed her to peoples of different cultures and denominations. Particularly interesting for her, was the interaction with other Africans from the diaspora whose concerns, she realised, were similar although not at the same level with those of her people in the Sudan and the rest of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told APS that she sees and believes in the promise of hope as presented in the Gospel but could not help asking: &quot;Why are blacks everywhere suffering up to now? It is true God is God of justice, but I ask myself, when Africa has so many Christians, why do people in Rwanda, Sudan, Liberia and other countries continue to suffer the way they do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her questions were a reflection of similar ones raised by fellow delegates in a regional meeting for the 50 Africans attending the CWME. Concerns raised by representatives of various churches from West, North, Central, Eastern and Southern Africa, ranged from the crisis in Rwanda and Burundi, civil war in Sudan and other countries, the sale and purchase of arms, to the growing threat of Islamic fundamentalism in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KISANGANI, ZAIRE (APS) DECEMBER 16 - In his capacity as the Archbishop of the Catholic Archdiocese of Kisangani in Upper Zaire, Archbishop Laurent Mosengwo Pasinya, former President of the High Council of the Republic in Zaire has made &quot;a desperate appeal' to the world to help the suffering people in Kisangani, North and South Kivu areas of Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am making a desperate appeal to the powers of this world and political decision makers all over the world, to assist the population of Kisangani in Upper Zaire as well as the hundreds of thousands of Rwandese refugees and other Zaireans in North and South Kivu,&quot; Archbishop Pasinya said in a statement on December 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamenting that after a month of prevarication and hesitation nothing has come of the multinational force mandated by the United Nations to provide security for relief agencies, the Archbishop said, &quot;this evasion and hesitation have led to flux of refugees, displaced people and panic stricken populations towards Kisangani or deeper within the forest which will only lead to further insecurity in the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his statement, the Archbishop said a famine of &quot;unimaginalable proportions&quot; awaits Kisangani if the world does not help soon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tutsi dominated Banyamulenge rebels who have seized a huge tract of territory in Eastern Zaire, say Kisangani on the banks of River Zaire is their next target. They say they hope to use River Zaire to travel further inland and eventually seize the capital of Zaire, Kinshasa, more than 1000 kilometres downstream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other religious sources in Kisangani have confirmed the gravity of the humanitarian crisis facing more than 600,000 persons in Kisangani and its surroundings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catholic missionaries who fled Eastern Zaire say a secret civil war has become more and more of a possibility. Already there is a ban on river barges entering Kisangani and food was running out. The access roads into the city are closed. With the fall of Beni- Butembo and the sacking of Bunia, both sources of food for Kisangani, starvation by stages is imminent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is hunger, people are only eating every two days, it is death by stages. The soldiers are also hungry. This increases the risk of disorder and insecurity, particularly after the systematic looting at Bunia, Mamabasa, Nduya, and of missions in the north of the diocese of Mahagi and Butembo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In another month,&quot; warned Catholic missionary sources &quot;there will be widespread starvation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious missionary sources asserted that it is important for the world television networks to tell the world &quot;what is happening in Kisangani and on the road from Lubutu to Walikale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile according to the Action by Churches Together (ACT - a network of churches and their related agencies meeting human need through co-ordinated emergency response and common identity), the situation in Eastern Zaire remains quite fluid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are reports of troop movement around Bunia, Kindu and Kisangani while a group of Interahamwe and former Rwanda Army troops have been identified near Walikale. ACT, quoting Christian AID, says in the Bukavu area of Eastern Zaire, the local population is leaving in fear of the Banyamulenge rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further disturbing news about the mass exodus of Rwandese refugees in Western Tanzania have come from international relief bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source at the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) said on December 12 that Ngara and Benaco camps which previously held as many as 300, 000 Rwandese refugees, are now virtually empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandese refugees are fleeing Tanzania following a government ultimatum that they return to Rwanda by December 31, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandese are reportedly headed north to Uganda, Kenya and southwards to Zambia and Malawi. Only a relatively small group of about 15,000 Muslim Hutu refugees have made up their minds to return home to Rwanda. Reliable sources say the Muslim Hutus are not scared of the fate awaiting them in Rwanda since &quot;very few Muslim Hutus participated in the genocide of 1994.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitchell, serving a 30-year jail term for his role in a 1988 massacre in which 11 people died, has been granted amnesty by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth body's amnesty committee said in a statement on December 10 it was satisfied that the killings were associated with a political objective and had ordered his release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prison authorities said an elated Mitchell was freed late the same day from the prison in Pietermaritzburg, former capital of Kwa-Zulu- Natal province, where he had been held since April 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was met, according to prison official Colin van der Merwe, by his ex- wife, who divorced him while he was in prison. It is believed the couple plan to make an attempt at reconciliation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitchell is the fourth person and the first former member of the apartheid security forces to be granted amnesty by the truth commission since it began its work last April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, which is probing human rights abuses committed during the apartheid era, is compelled to grant amnesty to perpetrators who make full confessions and show that their deeds were politically motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former police captain headed a death squad which launched an attack on a home in Trust Feed rural area outside Pietermaritzburg on December 3, 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he did not take part in the actual attack, Mitchell identified the target and gave instructions to lower-ranked policemen to carry out the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, he believed the house was occupied by activists of Nelson Mandela's then-outlawed African National Congress (ANC), which police regarded as enemies of the apartheid state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact those killed were mourners attending an all-night vigil and were supporters of the ANC's archrivals and the organisation at the time being supported by police, the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitchell was sentenced to death in 1992 for the killings but when the death sentence was abolished in South Africa last year, his sentence was commuted to 30 years in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was one of th first former security force members to appear before the amnesty committee, telling it he had been following orders &quot;from the top&quot; in ordering attacks on ANC targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he deeply regretted the deeds and offered to make restitution to the families of the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amnesty committee said in its statement that Mitchell had complied with all the requirements to qualify for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It noted that four police constables who were convicted with Mitchell were granted amnesty and released in 1992 under a deal between the ANC and the former apartheid government in which all political prisoners were freed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal smoothed the way for an eventual negotiated political settlement in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, former cadres of the now-defunct armed wing of Mandela's ANC have begun applying to the commission for amnesty, an ANC spokesman said in Johannesburg on December 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa declined to identify those who had applied for amnesty, telling the domestic SAPA news agency that names would only be available later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Sunday Independent newspaper claimed Defence Minister Joel Modise, his deputy Ronnie Kasrils and a senior ANC military commander, Aboobaker Ismail, were among those who were applying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until then, ANC cadres have been reluctant to join thousands of former white police officers and soldiers who have applied for amnesty, claiming that because they opposed an unjust system, they should be treated differently to those who defended it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga province premier Mathews Phosa, a senior ANC official, went further, saying that for an ANC cadre to apply for amnesty was like Moses applying for amnesty for having led the Israelites out of Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comment earned him a sharp rebuke from commission chairman, former Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who has been overseeing the truth commission since it was set up in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With state prosecutors getting ready to launch a series of trials of ANC members, the cadres now are running scared and are rushing to beat a December 14 deadline for amnesty applications, the Sunday Independent reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper said that among a number of cases being investigated by police is a 1983 car bomb explosion outside air-force headquarters in Pretoria which killed 17 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC, which became a guerrilla movement during the time it was banned -- from 1960 until 1990 -- claimed responsibility for the blast, as well as for a number of other attacks on &quot;soft&quot; targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some former members of the ANC's armed wing -- Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation, or MK) -- told the newspaper they had received little support from their seniors and were not sure who would be paying for their legal costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARIDI, SUDAN (APS) DECEMBER 16 - The Episcopal Church of Sudan (ECS) recently organized a four-day workshop here to discuss the basic concept of peace and biblical perspectives in the Old and New Testament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The November 25 to 28 workshop in this Western Equatorial town, southern Sudan, had as its principal objectives the setting up of a peace and reconciliation forum and dialogue among the different groups in order to encourage both military and political leaders, local authorities, elders and chiefs to be conscious about their role in peace making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also hoped to encourage, especially local commanders, to support grassroots peace initiatives and promote a culture of peace at local and regional levels as well as develop mechanisms of conflict resolutions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The model of Jesus Christ as peacemaker was discussed. Other topics included obstacles to peace in southern Sudan, politics and religion, the main difficulties in church/political relationships, the United Nations convention on human rights and international convention on the rights of the child, traditional methods of peacemaking and inter-tribal relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its four-day deliberations, the workshop recommended that the position of chaplaincy be created in the army, called for continuous dialogue at all levels including elders, chiefs, commanders, local authorities and NGOs. Also that similar workshops should be organized to follow-up implementation of the resolutions reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 150 delegates, who included church and political leaders, local authorities administrators and forces' commanders, talked of the revival of traditional ways of conflict resolution at family and community levels, with the involvement of both women and youth in the peace process, as well as non- use of force in child recruitment into the armed forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loss of moral values in the society was a recurrent subject in the workshop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants were concerned that the value of morals should be restored in society to make children respect elders, giving parents the opportunity to educate their children (as they should) on how to become responsible persons in their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants also talked of cases of chiefs being beaten by their own soldiers in the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), and said this should be discouraged by all means if peace is to be achieved at grassroots level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ufulle Gaaro, justice and peace facilitator at the Nairobi-based New Sudan Council of Churches (NSCC) of which ECS is a member, told APS Sudanese are concerned that the centre of natural wisdom among leaders and chiefs seems to have been disrupted in one way or another. &quot;This is a very dangerous and serious issue which has affected our society and eventually peace as well, &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without unity, we cannot have real peace. Those of us who are fighting against injustice and oppression should be agents of peace, but not oppress for the second time,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants also admitted at the workshop that there is serious conflict among southern Sudanese themselves, which needs to be immediately addressed if dialogue with different factions is to be maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop was initiated and organized by the Diocesan Bishop of Maridi Joseph Marona and facilitated by Churches Ecumenical Action for Sudan (CEAS) and the local Catholic church.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHARPEVILLE, SOUTH AFRICA (APS) DECEMBER 16 - South African President Nelson Mandela on December 10 signed the country's new constitution into law, officially ending the period of multiparty powersharing in South Africa's political transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela hailed the basic law document as the embodiment of &quot;our nation's highest aspirations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Described as one of the most liberal in the world, the constitution outlaws racial discrimination, guarantees full rights for homosexuals, provides for abortion-on-demand and forbids capital punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It entrenches South Africa's new political order, by scrapping the interim multi-party government, but guarantees multi-party parliamentary elections and a host of basic rights, while restructuring and streamlining parliamentary structures, paving the way for the country's next elections, due in 1999.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 15,000 members of the public and invited dignitaries gathered under a heavy police and army presence in a football stadium in this township south of Johannesburg to witness the ceremony, held to coincide with International Human Rights Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1960, the township was the scene of the Sharpeville massacre, when apartheid police gunned down 69 unarmed black civil rights protestors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 10 however, it was the scene of celebration as some of the country's leading musicians and dancers entertained the crowd from a massive, colourfully decorated stage during the ceremony that was broadcast live on state television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the spectators sitting in the baking sun, were a small group of people who survived the Sharpeville killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela said the constitution is a monument to those &quot;whose blood drenched the soil of Sharpeville and elsewhere in our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we close ... a chapter of heroic struggle, we reaffirm our determination to build a society which each of us can be proud of as South Africans, as Africans, and as citizens of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In writing the words which today have become South Africa's fundamental law, our elected representatives have faithfully heard the voice of the people,&quot; he said, referring to the 490-member Constitutional Assembly which drafted the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mandela spoke, six airforce helicopters flew over the stadium, each towing the national flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new constitution took 18 months, thousands of public submissions and numerous lengthy closed door meetings between Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) and the former ruling National Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document was passed by the assembly with the required two-thirds majority on May 10 this year, the second anniversary of Mandela's inauguration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitutional Court, the country's most powerful judicial body, initially sent eight sections of the document back to the assembly for redrafting before it was finally approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cyrill Ramaphosa, the ANC chief negotiator during the drafting process, told the crowd that the signing marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the end of 350 years struggle for national unity,&quot; he said referring to the date European settlers first colonised South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today marks the legal transition to a constitution that represents a will of the overwhelming majority of the people of this country,&quot; Ramaphosa said. &quot; It is one law for one nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramaphosa, along with his NP counterpart Roelf Meyer are regarded as the main architects of the new document, which replaces the interim constitution that was negotiated prior to the 1994 poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seated on the podium near Mandela was NP leader and former president, Fredrick de Klerk, who withdrew his party from Mandela's cabinet shortly before the new constitution was passed by the assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conspicuous by their absence, however, were representatives of the Zulu- nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the country's third largest, which walked out of the constitutional negotiations in March 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFP, which has repeatedly demanded greater autonomy for its Kwa- Zulu- Natal province stronghold and accused the ANC of breaching a pre-election promise to submit disputed issues to international mediation, has threatened it will not recognise the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party had gone on record as opposing the sections it did not like, such as the one which reduced provincial powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not a revolutionary party. We will live by the country's constitution even as we seek all legal means to try to change aspects of it that we don't agree with,&quot; Jiyane said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the IFP's rejection of the document, Mandela diverted from the text prepared speech to say that there were &quot;good men and women in all parties ...  including the Inkatha Freedom Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legislators will begin implementing several aspects of the constitution early next year, starting with the restructuring of the national parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constitution's signing into law opens the way for the next general election, which although scheduled in May 1999, could now be held earlier.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA (APS) DECEMBER 16 - The process of nation building brings with it certain inevitable problems because of the non-homogeneity among the people involved, a week-long journalists seminar here was told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivering a key note speech at the symposium held from November 25 to 29, former commander of the United Nations Peace Keeping Force in the Middle East, Lt.Gen. Emmanuel A. Erskine appealed to African people to always seek amicable solutions to their conflicts as these led to massive destruction of property and a lot of suffering particularly to women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Erskine, a Ghanaian, who served in the Ghana army for many years before joining the UN forces, identified some of the major causes of conflicts as ethnic and religious differences and ideological incompatibilities which in certain countries find expression in brutal civil wars as has happened in Nigeria, Sudan, Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other conflicts, noted Erskine, were avoidable and preventable as they emanated from certain individuals' unbridled greed for power, total disregard for the rule of law and violent overthrow of democratically elected civil governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seminar which was titled Media: Conflict Resolution and Peace in Africa, was sponsored by a British Non-Governmental Organization, Panos. It was designed to bring together two media practitioners each from Liberia, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Rwanda and Sudan which are currently experiencing civil strife. Three other journalists, (one each) came from Chad, Uganda, Mali and Senegal, countries where there has been some relative resolution of conflict, to exchange their experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Bonnah Koomson of the School of Communication Studies, University of Ghana, noted that conflict situations bring with them their own peculiar challenges to journalists. &quot;One notorious failing forjournalist is how to deal with the truth in many instances, the truth becomes a casualty sacrificed on the altar of propaganda, misrepresentation, disinformation and exaggeration,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Koomson advised journalists to always stick to the ideals of their professional calling, noting that, &quot;ethical standards are not formulated with any pre-conditions/circumstances. Rather they are standards to be applicable at all times especially during conflict coverage. &quot;It is precisely during the moments of crisis that we as mortal individuals are most valuable and need the support of professional standards as reference points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Millius Palayiwa of International Alert, which brokered the peace talks in Sierra Leone, presented a paper titled: Sierra Leone Peace Talks: Reports and Reflections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peace agreement between Sierra Leonean President Alhaji Ahmed Kabbah and the leader of the Revolutionary United Front of Sierra Leone, Corporal Foday Saybana Sankoh, was signed on November 29. With the agreement, it is hoped that the brutal war that has claimed many lives and brought misery to hundreds of thousands in the West African state will be a thing of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other notable personalities at the seminar were Prof. Kwame Karikari of the School of Communication Studies, University of Accra, Dr. Pauline Otti of University of Jos, Nigeria, Dr. Hamidou Magassa, a socio-economic consultant in Bamako, Mali and Dr. Jibrin Ibrahim of the department of political science, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panos hopes to organise a similar gathering within the next six months in the Great Lakes region of Eastern and Central Africa. The organisation also hopes to launch an award scheme for both print and electronic media journalists who do exceptional work in covering conflict situations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SALVADOR, BRAZIL (APS) DECEMBER 16 - The 11th Conference on World Mission and Evangelism (CWME) ended here on December 3 with emphasis for the church to hold on to two realities -- its distinctiveness from, and its commitment to the culture in which it is set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The section work of the CWME, organized by the World Council of Churches (WCC) Unit II under the theme, Called to One Hope-The Gospel in Diverse Cultures, was informed by the preparatory Gospel and Cultures process, preparatory papers, the Rainbow-Festival of Gospel in Cultures exhibition, Econtros (series of in-depth presentations) with reports from many countries and regions of the world, Bible studies and the plenary sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme was studied in four inter-related sections namely, Authentic Witness within each Culture, Gospel and Identity in Community, Local Congregations in Pluralist Societies and One Gospel - Diverse Expressions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of these highlighted one element of the theme, attempting to inter- relate the two parts--one hope in the context of diverse cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The November 24 to December 3 meeting, which brought together more than 600 participants drawn from WCC member churches worldwide, sought to expose delegates, visitors, observers and members of the press to the diverse ways in which the Gospel has been experienced and expressed through cultures around the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the meeting, participants committed themselves and the churches, groups and agencies they represented to fresh missionary obedience and to take new directions in mission in the next millennium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By adoption of the conference message, the eleventh CWME emphasized that local congregations are called to be places of hope, providing spaces of safety and trust wherein different peoples can be embraced and affirmed, thus manifesting the inclusive love of God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference also underscored the inclusion of all cultural groups which make up the community, including those which are marginalised and despised.  Several such groups had been cited in earlier discussions in the section plenaries, sub-sections and small group sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acknowledging the need to constantly seek the insight of the Holy Spirit in helping Christians discern better where the Gospel challenges, endorses or transforms a particular culture, the CWME participants noted that by identifying with the two realities of the church mentioned earlier on the gospel neither becomes captive to a culture nor becomes alienated from it, but challenges and is illuminated by it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference message further described small steps which involve risk and courage as factors that can break through barriers and create new relationships. &quot;They can be the miracle which changes a church or a community's self image and enables new God-given life to break,&quot; added the CWME message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the place and role of relationships between a church and churches of other traditions and cultures, the conference singled out competitiveness as the surest way to undermine Christian mission, adding that aggressive evangelism that does not respect the culture of a people, is unlikely to reflect effectively the gracious love and challenge of the gospel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its conference message, the CWME which had a first-hand experience of seeing and hearing voices of Christians from many diverse cultures, expressing their struggles and hopes, was optimistic that the last great mission conference of the 20th century had clearly illuminated that the gospel, in order to be most fruitful needs to be both true to itself, and incarnated or rooted in the culture of a people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference heard stories of disaster, civil war, disease and poverty from speakers from Africa and marveled at the strength of Christian women in particular, to share the pain of their people, fight despair and sow the seeds of hope and food for nourishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young Christians from all over the world made it clear to the just ended Conference on World Mission and Evangelism, that they desired to be full partners in the work of mission especially in relating their faith to the energy and aspirations of youth culture today as opposed to being relegated to the position of objects of the church's mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting also heard the anger of African, Afro-Caribbean and Afro-Latino people at the horror of slavery and the way in which the faith, though presented to them in distorted forms, became the hope of liberation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a conference that admired the determination of these people not to be trapped in the lament of history but to cooperate together in a strengthened partnership between African people and people of the African diaspora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Christians in the Middle East, the meeting heard stories about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people living with the privilege and pain of life in a &quot;holy land&quot; torn apart by division and injustice, and their indignation at the way in which biblical texts are misinterpreted so that their culture is blemished and some are made to feel strangers in their own land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates also heard reports of growing localism among North American churches which, while strengthening their commitment to mission and evangelism in their own context, may lead to an isolation and insulation from global realities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The post-modern culture influencing much of Western Europe was also highlighted in the just ended mission conference, with emphasis on how churches are engaging with those turning from traditional faith and seemingly seeking a private &quot;pick and mix&quot; spirituality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CWME also shared the concern of many at how the world is not only facing a free economic market which seems to exercise sovereign power over even strong governments, but is also exposed to a free media market where images and messages of every description are influencing -- and some believe, undermining community and faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also heard how Christians in many places around the globe are engaging in serious dialogue with those of other faiths, thereby gaining a clearer and richer understanding of their own faith and also helping to build a &quot; community of communities&quot; to benefit all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between each World Council of Churches assembly, Unit II is responsible for organizing a Conference on World Mission and Evangelism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of four WCC programmatic units, the department focusses on equipping and strengthening churches in mission. In turn, the churches are called to make clear God's loving, eternal purpose to heal and reconcile all people to God in Jesus Christ and to restore wholeness to all creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main task of the CWME is to provide opportunities for churches, mission agencies, groups and national and regional councils concerned with Christian mission to meet together for reflection and consultation leading to common witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first World Mission conference was held in Edinburgh, United Kingdom in 1910, others have met as follows; Jerusalem (1928), Tambaram/Madras, India (1938); Witby, Canada (1947); Willingen, Germany (1952); Achimota, Ghana (1957/8); Mexico City, Mexico (1963); Bangkok, Thailand (1972/3); Melbourne, Australia (1980) and San Antonio, Texas, USA (1989).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazil, with its population of 160 million people is a cornucopia of cultures. With their long history of colonization, forced importation of Africans as slaves and subsequent waves of immigration, Brazilians are one of the most racially and culturally mixed peoples in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, about 90 per cent of its population is Roman Catholic, but Pentecostal churches and churches of charismatic traditions are growing at a phenomenal rate. There is also a variety of expressions of popular religiosity, born out of a rich blend of Christian, Afro-Brazilian and indigenous heritages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, Salvador in Bahia, the first city to be founded in Brazil and the country's first capital, is a reminder of the enslavement of those who were brought from Africa and their &quot;christianization&quot; by force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Bahia, as well as the whole of Brazil, stands as testimony to the survival power of the Afro-Brazilians and the persistence of their religious- culture.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The humanitarian situation in Shabunda, a settlement about mid-way between Bukavu and Kindu, is slowly becoming critical. ICRC activities are hampered by poor infrastructure, heavy rains and difficult access to the refugee site. Relief supplies are flown to Kindu from Nairobi in a Hercules cargo plane and then on to Shabunda by DC-3.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the runway, which is often water-logged, relief has to be transported to a river, transferred by dugout, and carried by bicycle to the site four kilometres from the river. Faced with ever increasing numbers of Rwandan and Burundian refugees, ICRC staff are struggling to provide basic food and medical assistance. Most recent refugee counts show that some 40,000 people have by now arrived in Shabunda, and continue to pour in at the rate of 3,000- 5,000 a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As these refugees are becoming increasingly settled at the site, urgent action is required to find a long-term solution, such as repatriation, before new camps are established. The ICRC has met with UNHCR representatives in Kinshasa and has offered air transport to Shabunda to make it possible to gather first-hand information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owing to heavy rain, the ICRC flight to Lubutu had to be cancelled. The ICRC has been in contact with Midecins sans Frontihres (MSF), which is working in Lubutu hospital. MSF has said that there are some 30,000 refugees in Tingitingi, seven kilometres west of Lubutu, and tens of thousands more along the road between Walikale and Lubutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kalemie, the ICRC has started to distribute food rations to 4,400 Zairian displaced and 800 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Access to areas around Goma and in North Kivu is still not possible, and the ICRC has no information about the victims of the conflict in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, delegates have been given greater access to the areas around Bukavu, and the local authorities have accepted the use of Red Cross messages in the areas they control. An ICRC team and a representative of the German Red Cross went to Uvira to evaluate the situation at the hospital and the possibility of resuming activities there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 December, eleven Zairian border guards and 14 family members were repatriated to Kinshasa from Uganda in an ICRC-chartered Hercules plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further source of concern for the ICRC has been recent Rwandan refugee movements in and out of camps in Tanzania. Refugees who had left their camps and moved deeper into Tanzania were returned to their camps. However, as of yesterday, a steady tide of Rwandan refugees has been returning to Rwanda via the Rusumo border post. The ICRC has set up two waystations along the Tanzanian road to the border to provide refugees with clean water. The ICRC also took care of 400 unaccompanied children found along the road. By the end of the day, 100 of these children had not yet been reunited with their families. On the Rwandan side of the border, four ICRC water engineers are providing safe drinking water using mobile treatment equipment and water tankers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Zaire's President Mobutu, who returned to the country yesterday, said he had come back against medical advice to take personal charge of the situation. In an address over state radio and television, he accused Zaire's &quot; enemies&quot; of choosing to &quot;stab him in the back&quot; when he was unwell and out of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He assured the people he had never &quot;retreated&quot; when the country was under threat, and he would not retreat this time. But he added that &quot;our enemies' provocation should not make us fall into the trap of blind xenophobia against the foreigners who have lived for years in our country without violating the laws of the republic.&quot; A US State Department spokesman said yesterday Mobutu should move towards establishing &quot;real democracy&quot; in Zaire. According to AFP, spokesman Glyn Davies said that &quot;after 56 years of promises, there really needs to be some action on the political front.&quot; He added it would be difficult to know what the country's future could be if Mobutu &quot;decides not to open the political system.&quot; &quot;The bottom line for the United States is that Zaire remains a single nation,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources in Goma said Mobutu's return had heightened fears among the local population of a counter-offensive by the Zairean army. On Monday, the ADFL rebels - seeking to weaken army morale ahead of Mobutu's arrival - appealed to Zairean soldiers to switch sides, Reuters reported. The appeal was contained in two documents signed by two Zairean officers who had apparently gone over to the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF warned yesterday that thousands of Rwandan refugees in Zaire could die before Christmas unless aid agencies launch a huge emergency relief operation to get food to more than 100,000 people who have arrived in Lubutu recently. Many of the refugees have arrived from the Mugunga camp near Goma, a distance of some 300kms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article in the Belgian daily 'De Morgen' over the weekend said aid workers were making an initial assessment of the situation in the Goma region, following a ceasefire announcement by rebel leader Laurent Kabila. They found 5,500 bodies, mostly in pit latrines of the former refugee camps. Some of them &quot;had an expression of pain on their faces,&quot; the newspaper reported.  It added that they were probably slaughtered by retreating Interahamwe militia, saying that dumping bodies in latrines was practised by the Interahamwe during the Rwandan genocide of 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 200,000 refugees have returned to Rwanda from Tanzania and more are said to be emerging from hiding to join the exodus. Most of the Ngara camps are now empty, but the Tanzanian authorities have allowed aid workers back into the camps to help any remaining refugees. UNHCR said some 2,300 Burundian refugees still in the Benaco, Musuhura and Lumasi camps were being regrouped with 20,000 Burundians in Lukole camp. Aid workers, quoted by AFP, said a Rwandan soldier last night fired several shots at a convoy bringing home refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP said it was planning to cut food rations by 70 percent after the first month of assistance to the Rwandan returnees. It was aiming to prevent dependency on external food assistance and encourage the returnees to become self-sufficient. WFP will assist with reintegration through work-for-food programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP also reported that 2,400 Rwandan refugees from the Karagwe camps in northwest Tanzania had been registered at Orutshinga (Orukinga??)in Uganda, while 200 Zairean refugees had arrived at Nebbi in northwest Uganda. WFP said more could be expected in the event of a further advance northwards by rebels in eastern Zaire. Further south in Tanzania, at Kigoma, UNHCR reported that refugees from Burundi and Zaire were continuing to arrive and that by mid- December there was a total of 174,500 refugees in the area. Of these, 2,120 were Rwandans. UNHCR said there was a problem regarding Zairean refugees who refused to be transferred from the town to the newly opened Nyarususu camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Roman Catholic priests said they had been deported by the Tanzanian authorities for opposing the repatriation of Rwandan refugees. The priests, from Spain and Italy, told reporters in Nairobi yesterday that the refugees did not want to return to Rwanda but that their pleas fell on deaf ears.  Human Rights Watch yesterday called on the Tanzanian government and UNHCR to &quot; stop forcing Rwandan refugees to repatriate.&quot; &quot;The Tanzanian government's use of force to drive Rwandan refugees over the border is a blot on their traditionally good record in respect of refugee rights,&quot; HRW said. &quot;Moreover, the UNHCR has shamefully abandoned its responsibility to protect refugees.&quot; HRW went on to say that the international community had &quot;barely disguised its satisfaction at seeing the refugee camps around Rwanda forcibly disbanded.  But moving the refugees from one side of the border to the other will not offer any lasting solution without justice for genocide victims and improved respect for human rights by the Rwandan government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan radio said last night that a new regional summit could soon be held to discuss the situation in Burundi. The Burundi conflict did not figure in a communique released by regional leaders after their summit in Nairobi this week. According to the radio, a report was given to the heads of state which &quot; noted that negotiations have not yet effectively begun&quot; between the Tutsi- dominated authorities in Bujumbura and Hutu rebels, and that leaders would meet soon to discuss the issue in depth. Burundi's foreign ministry issued a statement describing as &quot;shameful&quot; the fact that Burundi had not been invited to the Nairobi summit. The statement, broadcast by Burundi radio on Monday, said that if the summit did not call for lifting economic sanctions against the country, then Burundians should unite &quot;with the knowledge that sanctions are another war which must be fought.&quot; &quot;Warmongers and their supporters are spreading falsehoods so that the Nairobi meeting does not reach any meaningful resolution on Burundi,&quot; the statement added. &quot;The ministry reminds the international community that peace is slowly returning to many places in the country and citizens are dropping their support for the armed groups.&quot; Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, quoted by Rwandan radio, said the presence of a Burundian delegation at the Nairobi summit &quot;might have made a positive contribution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Secretary-General's outgoing Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region has made several proposals for the future of the mission. In a report to the UN Security Council, Raymond Chretien suggested appointing an envoy who either lives in Nairobi or somewhere close to the region, a roving envoy with no fixed home base for several months until a working relationship with regional leaders is established or an envoy who would visit the region as and when needed. In his opinion, the last option was the preferred one in order to build on the goodwill and momentum generated by his mission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . GREAT LAKES - Complex Emergency Situation Report No. 13 Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, December 17, 1996. Note: The last situation report was dated December 12, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda people, who are Tutsi of Rwandan origin, settled in the Mulenge hills of South Kivu, Zaire, and the Masisi region of North Kivu, Zaire, more than 200 years ago. Sporadic ethnic violence in the Masisi region has occurred since 1959, but it again escalated in the fall of 1995 as the former Rwandan army (the ex-FAR) and the Rwandan Hutu militia (the Interahamwe) targeted Banyarwanda Tutsi in an apparent attempt to create an area of Hutu control. In September 1996, the situation in the Uvira region of South Kivu began to resemble that of the Masisi region, as government-sanctioned harassment of Banyamulenge Tutsis intensified.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 8, 1996, the South Kivu Deputy Governor declared that Banyamulenge residents should leave the area within seven days or risk treatment as rebels. On October 14, fighting broke out between the Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairian Army (FAZ) near Runingo refugee camp, in South Kivu, forcing the roughly 220,000 refugees to flee. The Banyamulenge joined forces with other Zairian rebels to form the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), and the fighting spread, moving up the eastern border of Zaire from Uvira to Bukavu, and south from Rutshuru (North Kivu) to Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of shelling from Rwanda on October 26 and November 1, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kibumba, Katale, and Kahindo camps near Goma, fled to Mugunga camp. Both the ex-FAR and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)-financed Zairian Camp Security Contingent (CZSC), became involved in the fighting. After suffering defeat, the FAZ and CZSC retreated to the west, looting villages and displacing Zairians from Goma town and surrounding areas. Following Hutu attacks from Mugunga camp on Goma town, the ADFL counter-attacked on November 14, forcing the ex-FAR and Interahamwe to retreat to the west and compelling hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Government (USG) Humanitarian Assistance for Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 (to date)$85,457,688</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan refugees from eastern Zaire: An estimated 600,000 Rwandan refugees have returned from the Goma area camps to Rwanda. Most of the Rwandan refugees from the Bukavu and Uvira camps remain unaccounted for. Zambia reports 1,000 new Rwandan refugees, and Tanzania reports 1,200 new Rwandan refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian refugees: Of the 143,000 Burundian refugees originally in the Uvira area, some 62,000 refugees have returned to Burundi and about 13,500 have arrived in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newly Displaced: Fleeing continued fighting in Burundi, a new caseload of about 100,000 Burundian refugees has entered Tanzania. Approximately 35,000 Zairians have fled to Tanzania. Some 800 Rwandan and Zairian Tutsis remain in the Congo and 11,500 Zairians are reported in Uganda. The U.S. Embassy in Zaire estimates that 170,000 Zairians have been displaced by the conflict in eastern Zaire, including 20,000 from Uvira, 60,000 from Bukavu, 40,000 from Goma, and 50,000 from rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan Refugees from Tanzania: Of the 535,000 Rwandan refugees originally in Tanzania, about 6,500 returned to Rwanda between September 10 and December 12, and 175,000 returned from December 14 - 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unknown Populations: The U.S. military estimates there are 225,000 to 285, 000 people on the move within Zaire. UNHCR believes that there still may be as many as 400,000. It is uncertain whether these are displaced Zairians, Rwandan or Burundian refugees or former Rwandan militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations (U.N.) Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA) reports that as of the evening of December 17, some 175,000 Rwandan refugees have returned from Tanzania since December 14. Refugees continue to cross the border at a rate of up to 15,000 per hour. A member of USAID's Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) reported on December 17 that a column of refugees extends 12 km on either side of the Tanzanian border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Action of Churches Together (ACT) reports it has located 60,000 to 80, 000 Burundi and Rwandan refugees and 25,000 displaced Zairians in Lubutu, 300 km west of the Zaire-Rwanda border. ACT is airlifting supplies from Nairobi to Kisangani, for overland transport to Lubutu. A U.N. mission to the Lubutu on December 16 estimated there are approximately 120,000 refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Lubutu area. Although the adults are reportedly in good condition, some of the children show signs of malnutrition and severe dehydration. Humanitarian agencies established a Coordination Committee in Kisangani to coordinate relief assistance to this population. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delivered 10 metric tons (MT) of relief supplies to Kisangani for refugees and displaced persons on December 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 17, ICRC reported that an estimated 40,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees, reportedly from the Uvira camps, have arrived in the Shabunda region of eastern Zaire, 175 km west of Bukavu. Refugees continue to flow into Shabunda town at the rate of 3,000 to 5,000 per day. Most of the refugees are reportedly in bad condition, suffering from diarrhea, malaria, and malnutrition. ICRC is using Kindu as a base to pre-position supplies for transport to Shabunda, where they are providing protein biscuits and health assistance to the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political/Military Situation Clashes continue in eastern Zaire, between ADFL and FAZ forces. The ADFL claims to have captured towns along a 550 mile front. According to U.N. sources in Kinshasa, Kisangani is currently calm and Zairian Special Presidential Division troops reportedly control the town.  Uvira, Bukavu, and Goma remain calm and under ADFL control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1080, a Canadian-led multinational force (MNF) was formed to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the repatriation of refugees. The 14-nation steering group overseeing the MNF met in New York on December 13. Canada proposed termination of the MNF effective December 31 at the recommendation of General Maurice Baril, the force commander, who recently completed extensive consultations and a study of the situation on the ground. The USG will continue to use diplomatic means to gain full access for humanitarian organizations in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts The Government of Canada hosted a multi-donor meeting in Kigali on December 13 on the reintegration of Rwandan refugees, as a follow- on to the meeting held in Geneva on November 23. Representatives from 12 countries, the European Union, U.N. agencies, and the Government of Rwanda (GOR) met to discuss developments since the refugees began returning on November 15, to present GOR priorities, to review donor programs, and to discuss donor coordination efforts. The GOR reiterated its priorities of housing, security, justice and human resource development and called on donors to support whole communities, including returnees and existing residents alike. Shelter remains the highest priority, with the GOR reporting that populations have doubled or tripled in certain high impact communes, such as Kibuye where over 20,000 people returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uvira: Access to Uvira town is now authorized and relief organizations report that markets have re-opened and are well-stocked, the nearby refugee camps are deserted, water treatment supplies and equipment are available and the health structure is largely intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bukavu: On December 11, some 400 refugees returned via the Bukavu/Cyangugu corridor. Since mid-October, about 9,000 refugees have crossed at Cyangugu.  Returnees pass through the Nyagatere transit center and several way stations upon crossing the border, and water, sanitation, and food distribution systems are well established. Non- governmental organizations (NGOs) currently working in Bukavu include Concern International, Medecins Sans Frontieres/International (MSF/I), International Rescue Committee (IRC), Save the Children Fund/UK (SCF/UK), Christian Aid, Oxfam, and Caritas. U.N agencies and ICRC are also working in Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goma: USAID/DART reports that an average of 1,000 Rwandan refugees have been crossing daily at the Gisenyi border crossing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reports it has assisted in the repatriation of 35,000 refugees who have emerged from hiding in the Virunga National Park near Goma since November 19. WFP reports that the northern axis from Goma is closed to all humanitarian personnel. Access to the western and southern routes is permitted as far as Kalungo, about 50 km west of Goma. The U.N. has undertaken assessment missions as far as Kitchungu, half-way between Sake and Masisi, however the area is now deemed unsafe for further travel, due to unknown terrain and possible pockets of resistance. The following relief organizations are currently operating in Goma: American Refugee Committee (ARC), Merlin, Trocaire, SCF/UK, Concern International, Catholic Relief Services (CRS)/Caritas, Oxfam, MSF/I, ICRC, UNHCR, and WFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda: Following a December 4, meeting in Kibungo involving GOR, UNHCR, NGO and USAID/DART representatives, NGOs established water points, health posts and biscuit distributions along the route refugees returning from Tanzania were expected to take -- from Rusumo at the border to Rwamagana, 107 km inside the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To reduce congestion, the GOR is allowing only the National Red Cross to provide assistance at way stations between the border and Rwenteru, 18 km inside Rwanda. Most returnees walk from Rusumo to Rwenteru, where relief agencies are distributing high-energy biscuits and on December 14 and 15, relief agencies transported returnees from Rwenteru to their home communes.  Returnees are reportedly in good condition, as there was low malnutrition in the camps, most refugees have been vaccinated and they are carrying shelter materials with them. As of December 12, WFP had pre-positioned 1,200 MT of mixed food commodities and 70 MT of biscuits in Kibungo Prefecture, where the majority of the Rwanda refugees will repatriate. Pre-positioning of food stocks is also taking place in Byumba and Mutara prefectures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to UNHCR figures released on December 12, local authorities in the communes registered over 470,000 Rwandans returning from eastern Zaire during the month of November. UNHCR reports that most of the returnees are in good condition. Food distribution is ongoing in all prefectures of Rwanda.  From November 15 to December 12, WFP and NGO partners distributed about 9,700 MT of food commodities, representing over 580,000 people assisted with monthly rations. In addition, over one million high-protein biscuits were distributed. WFP reports that all who returned with the large influx in mid- November have received their initial seven-day ration at the commune level and most are now receiving monthly rations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) reports that while property disputes exist, most returnees are finding temporary accomodation with relatives, neighbors, or friends. In some cases where returnees have found their houses occupied, the two parties have made informal arrangements to live together temporarily. Officially, the GOR has given squatters two weeks to vacate dwellings belonging to returnees but implementation of this policy appears fairly loose at the commune level. In Karago Commune, Gisenyi Prefecture, old case load returnees are permitted to stay in homes belonging to new returnees until the harvest in late January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HRFOR reported that the GOR has detained at least 162 returnees since November 15, some for their own protection. Of the 4,331 former soldiers who registered with the GOR, 12 have been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi: U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Jose Ayala Lasso reported on December 11 that more than 1,000 people were massacred in Burundi between late October and late November. WFP reports that Kayanza and Bujumbura Rural provinces are insecure and the situation has deteriorated in Bubanza province.  Many parts of Bururi, Muramvya, Gitega, and Karuzi provinces continue to be unsafe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP food reserves in Burundi are depleting rapidly. Moving food by road from Isaka, Tanzania to Ngozi, Burundi, WFP can import 1700 MT of food per month, leaving a shortfall of 800 MT. WFP has requested approval from the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee and the Tanzanian National Sanctions Committee to transport food across Lake Tanganyika which is more efficient and less expensive than road routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reports that of the 62,000 Burundian refugees who have returned to Burundi from Zaire, about 45,000 spontaneously repatriated to Cibitoke province and 15,000 arrived through the Gatumba transit center outside Bujumbura. WFP is distributing returnee packages to both populations.  According to UNDHA, there were virtually no new arrivals at the Gatumba transit center between November 28 and December 10. The U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Burundi , UNHCR, and NGOs are monitoring returns to insecure areas. UNHCR reports that about 38,000 of the returnees to Cibitoke have settled in 10 government sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania: In early December the Government of Tanzania (GOT) called for the repatriation of all Rwandan refugees by December 31 but declared that no forced repatriation would occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 12, Rwandan refugees began to pour out of the Ngara refugee camps in Western Tanzania. Most refugees initially moved east, but were blocked by Tanzanian military troops. Those intercepted turned around and headed back towards the camps, and towards the border with Rwanda. On December 13, UNHCR stated that the Ngara camps would not be reconstituted and as of December 16, Lumasi, Benaco, Kitali, and Mushuhuru camps were virtually empty. On December 17, USAID/DART reported that the GOT allowed NGOs access to the Ngara camps to seek out vulnerable groups who remained behind and to provide needed assistance. The GOT had restricted most relief agencies from accessing the Ngara area. Some 20,000 Burundian refugees remain in two camps in Ngara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR also reported that of the estimated 124,000 Rwandan refugees in the Karagwe area camps (north of Ngara), from 90,000 to 100,000 remain in the camps while about 30,000 are moving around the countryside. Of the 30,000, roughly 20,000 have moved southeast into the Burigi game reserve, some have crossed into Uganda and others have moved east toward Bukoba. USAID/DART staff will be traveling to the Ugandan border on December 18 to monitor returnee movements. UNHCR is working with the GOT to facilitate the repatriation of those remaining in the Karagwe camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugee camps in Kigoma and Kibondo region are still filled with Burundian and Zairian refugees. The U.S. Embassy in Tanzania reports that there are 500 - 1000 new arrivals daily. Mtendeli Camp in the Kibondo region has expanded beyond its capacity, housing almost 70,000 Burundians. UNHCR plans to transfer about 20,000 to the newly opened Nduta Camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Assistance On October 26, BHR/OFDA deployed a USAID/DART to Kigali, Rwanda, to conduct assessments, report on the situation, and provide funding to NGOs, U.N. agencies, and international organizations for programs to assist with repatriation efforts. On November 7, 1996, U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda, Robert Gribbin, declared a disaster, noting that the refugee crisis in eastern Zaire poses a humanitarian emergency for Rwanda. On November 12, U.  S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson declared a disaster in Zaire, as a result of the violent break-up of refugee camps in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 18, the USG pledged $140 million in humanitarian and development assistance to address needs in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - A team of famous film makers are preparing a Hollywood film called 'Endurance' on the life story of the world beating Haile Gebre- Silassie, whose achievements have changed the negative impression of many outsiders towards Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leslie Woodhead, the director of the film told reporters here yesterday that, &quot;Endurance is a positive film and will counteract the negative image by which Ethiopia is often portrayed outside of Africa as a land of drought and starvation, deserts and war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wide - screen 35mm Hollywood feature cinema portrays the triumph of the Ethiopian spirit casting about 20 members of Haile's extended family.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film begins with Haile as a child with his family in a tukul in a village of Dara near Assela of Arsi Zone and ends in Atlanta when he triumphs against the rest of the world, Mr. Woodhead said. The cinema also features the other victories of the 1996 Olympics hero, major Haile Gebre-Selassie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Endurance, ... We will show a land where there still exists a true society, ... Ethiopia has much to teach and we in the West have much to learn, &quot; the director remarked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Co-producer of 'Endurance' Miss Sally Roy said Haile is chosen for the film because he reversed the world expectation that the victory in the 10,000 meters Olympic game would go to the other East African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Endurance will be screened this time next year in various parts of the world. The team has now completed a ten week shooting in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acclaimed Hollywood executives Terence Malick, Edward R. Pressma and Hanz Zimmer are the other makers of the film in pictures and music composition respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among Ethiopian members of the team are Mohammed Idris, who has worked with Laslie Woodhead over many years and Tafari Wossen of Waag Communications. the film crew also includes talented Ethiopian film makers Yilma Belay, Abebe Ketsela and Abebe Mergia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leslie Woodhead commended the close cooperation of the Ministry of Information and Culture, the police force, the Ministry of Education, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Ethiopian Airlines, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Ministry of Defence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - Donors pledge 2.5 bln. dollars</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overtly impressed by the government's ongoing efforts to reduce poverty, the donor community which attended the consultative group (CG) meeting recently, pledged to provide Ethiopia with US $2.5 billion over the next three-year period. The greater part of the sum was reportedly a grant and the balance loans on highly concessional terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefing reporters on the outcome of the meeting here, World Bank Regional Vice President for Africa, Callisto E.Madavo said that the two and a half-day discussion was a great success. He described the pledge as &quot;indicator of a tremendous vote of confidence&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a very good discussion in three priority areas - food security, education and health - and we were honoured to have Prime Minister Meles Zenawi with us to the meeting who unusually enriched our discussion. He was so forthright. it is a pleasure to see this kind of leadership on African soil,&quot; Mr. Madavo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is to be recalled that Finance Minister Sufian Ahmed said at the opening session that the medium-term requires a financial intake of US 2 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-polio vaccination launched</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second round sub-national anti-polio immunization was launched for three consecutive days beginning on last Friday with President Negasso Gidada vaccinating the first child at the Ba ata Clinic in Addis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - Algeria has announced a ban on the use of the French language in the country's administration and other public sectors. The measure becomes effective July 5, 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Algerian Transitional Council adopted on Tuesday the decree banning French in two years and calling for the widespread use of Arabic in this former French colony.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Council has given Algerian universities until July 5, 2000 when they must switch to teaching only in Arabic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban on French is part of the Arabization policy adopted after the country's independence from France on July 5, 1962.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, implementation of this decision has had to be abandoned several times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, in 1994 the decree was suspended due to the conflict between Arabophils and Francophils. The struggle between these two groups for linguistic dominance has still not abated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decree was adopted the same day the Ministerial Conference of French- speaking Countries began their meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of Arabic should be widespread by July 5, 1998 and by July 5, 2000 it should be compulsory in all the political, economic and social sectors in Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter no political statement, speech, or correspondence can be in French neither can any conference or lecture be given in this language.  Television programmes and oral communications will be made in Arabic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any public official writing documents in a language other than Arabic -- apart from contracts with international firms -- will be liable to a fine of 5,000 dinars (about 90 US dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is uncertain to what degree Algerians will heed this edict, although some 75 percent of the country's 26.6 million people are Arabs. Algerians have failed to obey orders to conduct government business exclusively in Arabic over the past 34 years. Moreover, some 25 percent of the population are Berbers who want their language, the indigenous language, to be given greater official recognition by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some opposition parties see the decree as a concession by President Liamine Zeroual to militant Moslem groups. The country has been embroiled in violence between the secular government and radical Moslem organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new decree also makes provision for the creation of a High Council for Arabic Language chaired by the Algerian head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a similar move, the present French government of Prime Minister Jacque Touvon has passed a law compelling radio stations in the country to play a certain percentage of their music in French and not English. French ultra- nationalists have been complaining that too many English words were in current use in French.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, despite or because of its former French colonial status, Algeria has said that English, and not French, will be the first and most important foreign language taught in its schools.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees fled fighting in the eastern Zairean towns of Goma and Bukavu.  Zairians displaced by the war are also among the refugees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Due to increased production of grain, Zimbabwe's agricultural sector is expected to grow by 49 percent by the end of the year, President Robert Mugabe said Thursday in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Grain crops made a significant contribution to this growth with maize production increasing from 839,000 tons in 1994/95 season to 2,609,000 tons while wheat production increased from 65,000 to 250,000 tons,&quot; he told parliament in his annual state of the union address.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobacco production also rose during the same period from 198,000 to 209,716 tons. Cotton also registered its third best harvest with 275, 000 tons, up from the previous 104,700 tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture contributes 11 percent to 14 percent of Zimbabwe's gross domestic product, producing about 60 percent of all raw materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Horticulture remains the most buoyant and the fastest growing industry, growth over the past 10 years has been consistent and has risen in value terms from 30,000 dollars to a projected 120 million dollars in the coming year,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horticulture is Zimbabwe's second largest single foreign currency earner to tobacco.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Faced with the predicament of having over one million people with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, the Zimbabwean government says it will introduce a code of practice prohibiting any form of discrimination against HIV/AIDS-infected workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was announced Thursday in Harare by President Robert Mugabe in his annual state of the nation address before parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the 150-seat house that the code of practice identified the responsibilities of government, employers and workers regarding people infected with the killer disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People infected with HIV or suffering from full-blown AIDS, he said, should never be discriminated against at the workplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the face of growing unemployment, insecurity and discrimination faced by workers with HIV/AIDS, a national code of practice on AIDS and employment has been drafted after an extensive multi-sectoral consultative process and now awaits gazetting for it to become a statutory instrument to our labor relations act,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government, he said, was concerned about the HIV/AIDS pandemic which continued to claim thousands of lives each year and was causing immense stress on the existing health facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean health authorities say that at least 54,744 AIDS cases have been recorded since 1987 when the first case was reported in the country. It is estimated that 600,000 children would be orphaned by AIDS by the year 2,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Appropriate behavioral change remains the cornerstone of HIV/AIDS prevention and control,&quot; he said. &quot;In line with this, education programmes emphasizing family values, self-respect and positive cultural practices have been targeted at youths in and out of school, men and women in the workplace and the public at large.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said another cause of concern was the continuing increase in tuberculosis cases. These have risen from 5,233 in 1986 to 30,831 in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical experts here say most of these cases are related to AIDS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi (PANA) - Burundian public workers will effective January 1997 have to contribute 6 percent of their monthly wages toward the ongoing civil war, which has engulfed the country since October 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued after a cabinet meeting in Bujumbura, the government said the measure will affect workers in the public, and private firms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that rural dwellers will be required to pay 1,000 Burundian francs, the equivalent of three U.S. dollars, per household.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Nov. 26, the government ordered a general mobilization of the population to contribute towards the war, which erupted in October 1993, after the democratically-elected Hutu President, Melchior Ndadaye, was assassinated in an abortive coup fomented by soldiers from the minority Tutsi ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the mobilization the office of military ruler, Maj. Pierre Buyoya, said that all able-bodied Burundians who make an income from their activities should contribute to a national solidarity fund created for the purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effective December, cabinet ministers and other high-ranking personalities with similar status are required to pay 25,000 Burundian francs per month (about 77 dollars) to set an example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the military government in Bujumbura also introduced compulsory national service of two months for all Burundians who complete secondary and university education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Tutsi-dominated administration in Bujumbura, these measures are expected to calm the charged ethnic tension, which has led to the death of at least 150,000 people since 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deaths occurred in revenge attacks between the majority Hutu ethnic group, to which Ndadaye belonged, and the Tutsi, whose rogue soldiers reportedly assassinated him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA, Zaire (PANA) - Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko appointed Lt. Gen.  Mahele Bokungu Lieko as chief of staff Thursday, in a military leadership change designed to regain territory lost to anti-government forces in the eastern part of the country and instill discipline in the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahele replaces army General Eluki Monga Aundi who was dismissed in November for publicly criticizing the government's handling of the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Mahele accepted the job on condition that he control the entire military establishment, especially the Presidential Division and Civil Guard which have been outside direct army command.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two units have been provide with superior quantities and quality of arms, equipment, and with more privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Mahele headed of the army from 1991 to 1993. His recall to the General Army Headquarters comes the day after Mobutu returned from four months of medical treatment in Switzerland and recuperation in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahele graduated from the Higher War Academy of Paris. He commanded the 311th Paratroop Battalion which seized the mining town of Kolwezi in the 1978 Katangese rebellion in Shaba Province, recapturing the airport from former Katangese gendarmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was promoted to colonel and subsequently to brigadier a few years later.  He was also appointed commander of the 1st Military Region with headquarters in Lubumbashi, Zaire's south-eastern province of Shaba. Later, he took command of the Military Intelligence Service, the SARM, in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He commanded the Zairian expeditionary corps in Rwanda, in 1990, at the beginning of the civil war which was rekindled by the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in April 1994, four months before Tutsi anti-government forces, called the Rwandan Patriotic Front, defeated the largely Hutu government in July 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahele was appointed army chief of staff and promoted to Lieutenant General in 1991, following the mutiny which degenerated into looting in the Zairean capital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Zaire named a new army chief yesterday as reports mounted of preparations for a counter-offensive against the rebels in eastern Zaire.  Zairean television said General Mahele Bokoungo Lieko had been appointed army chief by presidential decree to restructure the armed forces &quot;with a view to putting them on a war footing and improving their efficiency&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Mahele, who held the post in 1991 and 1992 and who is said to be popular in Zaire, will also head the crack Special Presidential Division (DSP) troops as well as the civil guard and gendarmerie. The current civil guard chief, General Baramato Kpama, had been acting army chief and it is not known what role he will now play. Mobutu was due to meet political leaders today, according to state television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuters reported that hundreds of residents were fleeing Goma, fearful of a counter-attack by the Zairean army. Residents told Reuters they believed French troops were based at Kisangani and would bombard Goma from the air, but there has been no confirmation of this. In a speech to the nation late Tuesday, Mobutu vowed to take personal control of the rebellion in the east.  A spokesman for opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi described Mobutu's message as &quot;generally satisfactory&quot;. Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress plans to hold an emergency congress on Saturday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eastern Zaire rebels announced they were ready for any counter-offensive, saying Mobutu's return changed nothing. Rebel leader Laurent Kabila called on Mobutu to resign and hand over power to the ADFL. &quot;We are well prepared, morale of our troops is high and the population supports their liberation from slavery,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;Either he (Mobutu) engages himself in negotiations with the alliance to solve the political crisis or he has to face the law of force,&quot; Kabila said. In further remarks, broadcast by rebel Star Radio today, he assured civilians that they were safe and urged them not to flee rebel-held areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A possible standoff between rebels and Zairean troops in Bunia was gaining momentum as Zairean reinforcements were flown into the town, while sources on the ground reported that rebels were in control of villages around the town, including Boga, Geti and Mambasa. Eight to ten planeloads of Zairean soldiers have reportedly been flown to Bunia from Kisangani, and troops are arriving from Kinshasa to beef up forces in Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP began airlifting food aid into Kisangani yesterday for onward distribution to Lubutu where missionary sources confirmed the presence of up to 150,000 mostly Rwandan and Burundian refugees at Tingi-Tingi just outside the town. They were said to be faring better than some 50,000 displaced people further south in Katshungu who were in very poor shape. WFP however, said the children in Lubutu were particularly vulnerable, many of them showing signs of severe dehydration. There has been speculation - so far unconfirmed - that the Lubutu refugees may comprise ex-FAR/Interahamwe elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ICRC said it was providing assistance for almost 50,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees who had gathered near the town of Shabunda. There were several thousand new arrivals very day at the temporary site deep in the forest. ICRC said the aid operation was being conducted in extremely arduous conditions because of the nature of the terrain and heavy rainfall. Supplies were first airlifted by heavy transport plane from Nairobi to Kindu, then transferred to lighter aircraft which can land at Shabunda. There they were loaded onto dugout canoes, and bicycles were used for the last part of the journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya lashed out at Zaire yesterday, saying it took great exception to comments by Zairean Information Minister Boguo Makele that the second Nairobi Great Lakes summit was a plot by anglophone countries to destabilise Zaire. &quot; It is regrettable that Zaire does not appreciate efforts by the leaders of the subregion to find solutions to the crisis in Zaire,&quot; said a statement, signed the permanent secretary in the information ministry, Samuel Ambuka.  Media reports point out that the Nairobi summit strengthened Kenyan President Moi's hand in the region by successfully including President Mandela to handle a crisis outside his immediate region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan returnees from Tanzania's Ngara camps today were put at 20,000 as of 10:30 local time, while an estimated 225,000 had arrived by yesterday. A UN spokesman confirmed that a Rwandan soldier had fired on a vehicle in a UNHCR convoy yesterday. No injuries were reported, but night-time operations were suspended as a result. Way stations are being set up for about 120,000 refugees expected to start the long trek from the Karagwe camps to the Rusumo border crossing in the next few days. Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete reiterated that all Rwandan refugees must return, despite criticisms of human rights violations. &quot;We won't listen, we won't apologise to anyone.  Let them talk until they get tired and keep quiet,&quot; he said. Allowing the refugees to remain in Tanzania would just provide a haven for ex- FAR/Interahamwe groups, he added. Kikwete also said his government would hand over an undisclosed number of Rwandan refugees indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. These included some of the refugees rounded up last week for intimidating fellow refugees, he told a news conference. &quot;We will send them to the Arusha tribunal to face charges of genocide in Rwanda,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda yesterday refused to host some 2,000 Rwandan refugees who crossed into its territory from camps in Tanzania. In an interview with the state- owned 'New Vision&quot; newspaper, Local Government Minister Bidandi Ssali said the refugees, who were sheltering at the Oruchinga camp in Mbarara district, would either have to go home, or back to Tanzania. &quot;We are not prepared to accept them here, not because they are Hutus, but because they have contravened the UN convention on refugees,&quot; he said. Malawi also said it would not offer asylum to Rwandans escaping repatriation from Zaire and Tanzania, saying it had suffered badly from environmental problems when it had hosted Mozambican refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report in Kenya's 'East African Standard' today claimed at least 100 Hutu refugees had secretly crossed into Kenya from Tanzania over the last four days. The newspaper cited sources as saying the refugees from camps in the Ngara region, had entered Kenya through the Isebania border area in Kuria district using secret routes to avoid immigration procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda reported that some 5,500 Zairean refugees in the Gisenyi area began returning home yesterday. According to Rwandan radio, monitored by the BBC, the refugees had been living at the university compound in Mudende, Mutura commune. Local authorities concluded there was no reason for the refugees to continue living under sheeting when their home areas were peaceful, the radio said. Meanwhile, according to UN figures, 446 Burundians, fleeing fighting in Cibitoke province, entered Rwanda via Cyangugu between 13-16 December. They are being housed at a camp for Burundian refugees near Bugarama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi's main Hutu party FRODEBU yesterday accused the military of killing 4,000 Hutu refugees who had returned to Burundi from Zaire. The claim was made by party leader Jean Minani in an interview with Radio France Internationale from Arusha, Tanzania. A UN human rights report a week ago said 1,000 people had been massacred between end October-end November, mostly by soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vatican on Tuesday said it had convened a meeting of Roman Catholic bishops from the Great Lakes to discuss the crisis in the region, the first such meeting in four years.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda and Sudan are to meet in Kampala this week for peace talks brokered by Iran, although President Museveni said he did not expect huge progress to be made. &quot;I have agreed that talks should take place here,&quot; he told a news conference late Tuesday. &quot;But of course we have not broken any ground with (Sudanese Islamic leader) Mr al-Tourabi's people.&quot; Museveni said Uganda was still searching for a military solution to the rebellion in the north, which it says is backed by Sudan. &quot;We must get a solution to al-Tourabi's blackmail, a military solution,&quot; Museveni said. &quot;I am not going to invade al-Tourabi.  Al-Tourabi has enough enemies who will take care of him.&quot; Sudan accuses Uganda of supporting the rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army in the south.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Due to increased production of grain, Zimbabwe's agricultural sector is expected to grow by 49 percent by the end of the year, President Robert Mugabe said Thursday in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Grain crops made a significant contribution to this growth with maize production increasing from 839,000 tons in 1994/95 season to 2,609,000 tons while wheat production increased from 65,000 to 250,000 tons,&quot; he told parliament in his annual state of the union address.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobacco production also rose during the same period from 198,000 to 209,716 tons. Cotton also registered its third best harvest with 275, 000 tons, up from the previous 104,700 tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture contributes 11 percent to 14 percent of Zimbabwe's gross domestic product, producing about 60 percent of all raw materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Horticulture remains the most buoyant and the fastest growing industry, growth over the past 10 years has been consistent and has risen in value terms from 30,000 dollars to a projected 120 million dollars in the coming year,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horticulture is Zimbabwe's second largest single foreign currency earner to tobacco.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Faced with the predicament of having over one million people with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, the Zimbabwean government says it will introduce a code of practice prohibiting any form of discrimination against HIV/AIDS-infected workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was announced Thursday in Harare by President Robert Mugabe in his annual state of the nation address before parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the 150-seat house that the code of practice identified the responsibilities of government, employers and workers regarding people infected with the killer disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People infected with HIV or suffering from full-blown AIDS, he said, should never be discriminated against at the workplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the face of growing unemployment, insecurity and discrimination faced by workers with HIV/AIDS, a national code of practice on AIDS and employment has been drafted after an extensive multi-sectoral consultative process and now awaits gazetting for it to become a statutory instrument to our labor relations act,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government, he said, was concerned about the HIV/AIDS pandemic which continued to claim thousands of lives each year and was causing immense stress on the existing health facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean health authorities say that at least 54,744 AIDS cases have been recorded since 1987 when the first case was reported in the country. It is estimated that 600,000 children would be orphaned by AIDS by the year 2,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Appropriate behavioral change remains the cornerstone of HIV/AIDS prevention and control,&quot; he said. &quot;In line with this, education programmes emphasizing family values, self-respect and positive cultural practices have been targeted at youths in and out of school, men and women in the workplace and the public at large.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said another cause of concern was the continuing increase in tuberculosis cases. These have risen from 5,233 in 1986 to 30,831 in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical experts here say most of these cases are related to AIDS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi (PANA) - Burundian public workers will effective January 1997 have to contribute 6 percent of their monthly wages toward the ongoing civil war, which has engulfed the country since October 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued after a cabinet meeting in Bujumbura, the government said the measure will affect workers in the public, and private firms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that rural dwellers will be required to pay 1,000 Burundian francs, the equivalent of three U.S. dollars, per household.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Nov. 26, the government ordered a general mobilization of the population to contribute towards the war, which erupted in October 1993, after the democratically-elected Hutu President, Melchior Ndadaye, was assassinated in an abortive coup fomented by soldiers from the minority Tutsi ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the mobilization the office of military ruler, Maj. Pierre Buyoya, said that all able-bodied Burundians who make an income from their activities should contribute to a national solidarity fund created for the purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effective December, cabinet ministers and other high-ranking personalities with similar status are required to pay 25,000 Burundian francs per month (about 77 dollars) to set an example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the military government in Bujumbura also introduced compulsory national service of two months for all Burundians who complete secondary and university education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Tutsi-dominated administration in Bujumbura, these measures are expected to calm the charged ethnic tension, which has led to the death of at least 150,000 people since 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deaths occurred in revenge attacks between the majority Hutu ethnic group, to which Ndadaye belonged, and the Tutsi, whose rogue soldiers reportedly assassinated him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA, Zaire (PANA) - Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko appointed Lt. Gen.  Mahele Bokungu Lieko as chief of staff Thursday, in a military leadership change designed to regain territory lost to anti-government forces in the eastern part of the country and instill discipline in the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahele replaces army General Eluki Monga Aundi who was dismissed in November for publicly criticizing the government's handling of the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Mahele accepted the job on condition that he control the entire military establishment, especially the Presidential Division and Civil Guard which have been outside direct army command.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two units have been provide with superior quantities and quality of arms, equipment, and with more privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Mahele headed of the army from 1991 to 1993. His recall to the General Army Headquarters comes the day after Mobutu returned from four months of medical treatment in Switzerland and recuperation in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahele graduated from the Higher War Academy of Paris. He commanded the 311th Paratroop Battalion which seized the mining town of Kolwezi in the 1978 Katangese rebellion in Shaba Province, recapturing the airport from former Katangese gendarmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was promoted to colonel and subsequently to brigadier a few years later.  He was also appointed commander of the 1st Military Region with headquarters in Lubumbashi, Zaire's south-eastern province of Shaba. Later, he took command of the Military Intelligence Service, the SARM, in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He commanded the Zairian expeditionary corps in Rwanda, in 1990, at the beginning of the civil war which was rekindled by the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in April 1994, four months before Tutsi anti-government forces, called the Rwandan Patriotic Front, defeated the largely Hutu government in July 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahele was appointed army chief of staff and promoted to Lieutenant General in 1991, following the mutiny which degenerated into looting in the Zairean capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years later, after ruthlessly repressing the mutiny and the looting in Kinshasa, he resigned his command, allowing Gen. Eluki to take over the army.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MUTARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Bongie watched helplessly as her brother-in-law kicked the coffin in which her husband lay dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You useless man,&quot; he shouted to the shock of mourners present at the graveside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives and friends of the deceased were horrified by this desecration of the dead and quickly rushed to restrain the man, as he made his way to the widow, to vent his fury on her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brother-in-law's outrage had been provoked by the issue of inheritance as read out from a letter written by the deceased before his death regarding the disposal of his estate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will fix you today for inducing my brother into leaving everything in your trust, you filthy woman,&quot; he shouted, as he headed to where Bongie was seated, crying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was joined by his sisters and parents who felt they were entitled to a share of the inheritance, despite the fact that the deceased had a wife and children who had to be looked after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the existence of valid wills, this is the trauma some widows in Zimbabwe face, like elsewhere in Africa, when their husbands die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bongie is just one of many such bereaved women who have been harassed at a time of mourning by greedy in-laws who feel they, and not the bereaved lawful wife, should inherit the deceased's estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although many widows suffer in silence and watch helplessly as in-laws grab their property, some are brave enough to seek protection from the courts which results in relations being further strained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My husband did not have a will; it is one thing we had never put any thought into. We never imagined things coming to this,&quot; says Bongie. &quot;He only wrote a letter with instructions on the distribution of his belongings a few days before his death which his relatives think I forced him to write.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people realize the importance of writing wills when it is rather late, maybe because death is one thing that people do not prepare for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is need to attach importance to wills as they at times prevent harassment of the surviving spouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zimbabwe, if a black person dies without writing a valid will, his property is normally administered and disposed according to customary law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Zimbabwean customary law is discriminatory against women as it does not protect the interests of widows on issues relating to inheritance, despite the fact that at times the woman would have contributed towards the upkeep of the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A widow is not protected under the customary law because she cannot inherit and may have to go to court for protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My wife is very hardworking and has contributed financially in buying our property including the house which we live in. But if I die today without leaving a valid will she will face a lot of harassment from people who have not contributed a cent towards our belongings,&quot; one lawyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perpetua Bganya, a training officer with the Justice, Peace and Reconciliation Unit of the Zimbabwe Council of Churches, says there is an urgent need to change the country's customary laws regarding inheritance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The way we live today is different from the times when the customary law was enacted and it is now open to abuse by greedy relatives,&quot; she says. &quot; Women should be given the right to inherit in their own capacity not through a child. There is need to move away from the system where women are treated as perpetual minors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the death of her husband in May, Bongie has lived a miserable life fighting frantic efforts by her father-in-law to take possession of the house she jointly bought with her late husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father-in-law has vowed to have Bongie and her children evicted from their home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the funeral, the father-in-law has also been fighting to have his son's bank savings and pension contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not surprised about the behavior of my in-laws. Before my husband's death they accused me of being a witch, but I never thought their hatred for me could go this far,&quot; says Bongie, fighting back tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bongie's in-laws, who confiscated some of her household goods have not returned the property because they claim &quot;it was bought by their son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if this was not enough, they have put a plaque on the grave inscribed &quot; pano hapasvikwe nevatorwa&quot;, which means, &quot;strangers are barred from this grave-site.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, Bongie believes, is a move taken to frustrate her. So, she has vowed never to stop visiting her husband's grave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite their efforts to restrain me from visiting my husband's grave, only death can prevent me from doing so,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bganya says most Zimbabwean women are stripped of property which they have worked for because they do not know the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of them, she adds, are afraid of the stigma attached to possession of property belonging to the dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Bganya says she is unafraid to inherit property that she and her late husband jointly worked for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no need to make me a trustee to the heir,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a progressive legislation which takes into account the tribulations of women such as Bongie will give new respectability to Zimbabwe's outdated customary law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The investiture of Kofi Annan as secretary-general designate of the United Nations and the return home to Zaire of President Mobutu Sese Seko were the dominant issues this week in the editorials of African newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent, an Accra daily, said of Annan's election: &quot;We congratulate him and the other great African, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who preceded him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan, it noted, &quot;was elected because he also comes from a country which has seen the wisdom of democracy, peace and stability. The best support Ghana can show to the African, Kofi Annan, will be to maintain the democratic march.  &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It continued: &quot;Dr Kwame Nkrumah, who put Ghana and Africa on the U.N. map, and other illustrious pan-Africanists like Marcus Garvey, Du Bois, Padmore and Casely-Hayford, must be happy in their graves that an African of Ghanaian origin has been given the singular opportunity to hold such an important post.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dakar's Sud Quotidien, a daily, asked: &quot;Will the new secretary-general really be a strongman for the organization or will he be inclined to please the United States which contributed largely to his election?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future, it said, would answer that question. But for the moment and within Africa, it went on, Annan's election, had left &quot;a deep wound between Anglophones and Francophones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It noted that at the United States' urging of deeper reform of the U.N.  Boutros-Ghali had faltered and this had cost him his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the paper said, reform was needed in the composition of the permanent members of the security council. In such an eventuality Africa should be on the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By initially backing Boutros-Ghali, then later Annan, the Kinshasa paper, La Societe, said, &quot;Africa has acted correctly: political realism had prevailed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's only fault, it pointed out, was that it had allowed powerful nations within the U.N. Security Council to bring up &quot;the false linguistic pretext&quot; as a means of choosing the candidate of their choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They did this, it said, through &quot;the deliberate division of the continent (Africa) into Francophone and Anglophone blocks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What does Africa gain or lose when an Anglophone or a Francophone occupies a coveted international post?&quot; it asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kofi Annan should act independently, although he was imposed by the United States,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The strength of character of a man lies in his capacity to say no to diktat that runs counter to the interest of the international community. This is what the new secretary general should know and take into account,&quot; it concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Soft, another Kinshasa paper, doubted Annan could maintain his independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that whereas he was an &quot;architect of consensus&quot; and &quot;a good civil servant&quot;, he was incapable of saying no to his staff, so he will not be able to say so to the big powers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on Mobutu's return to Zaire after a four-month medical furlough, the Times of Zambia said, &quot;the Zairean strongman will need more than just his military skills to put down a revolt by ethnic Tutsis known as Banyamulenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added: &quot;He needs political tact as well to ward off the spectra of a bigger conflagration which could drive the vast country into irredeemable political chaos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the crisis &quot;cannot be resolved through military confrontation,&quot; it said, &quot;it calls for more rational responses from Zairean leaders who should lend support to the regional peace initiatives to find an amicable solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper said that with Mobutu's assurance that Zaire would recognise the inalienable right to citizenship and nationality of all the people within its borders, including Tutsi, it hoped that this would allay the mounting fears &quot; of the minorities who felt threatened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our fervent hope, too, that the pledge made by President Mobutu will open the process of dialogue and pave way for a permanent truce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said &quot;African unity will be rendered a farce if xenophobia grips the continent that could lead to the dismemberment of countries as a whole with all the attendant evils.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this Sud Quotidien added: &quot;Marshall Mobutu, conscious of the fact that the solution to the crisis is to be found in negotiation, will not wait to go to the table in a position of weakness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, it said, was all the more so since the meetings of the Organization of African Unity and those of the countries of the subregion had produced no positive results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire, it said, &quot;continues to deny&quot; the existence of an internal armed rebellion, &quot;and continues, merely, to accuse Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda&quot; of complicity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a message to Boutros-Ghali, O.A.U. Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim applauded Boutros-Ghali &quot;for his valuable contribution in the service of humanity&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said: &quot;As you are about to relinquish your responsibilities, you must know that we, in Africa, take particular pride in the manner in which you have discharged your duties at the helm of the United Nations at a very challenging and difficult time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have done so in a very admirable manner, with a high sense of professionalism and commitment, impeccable integrity and independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the first African U.N. secretary-general, you have done us a great honor by your immense contribution to the promotion of peace and understanding within the comity of nations,&quot; Salim said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim commended Boutros-Ghali for the various important initiatives he had undertaken, as part of his efforts for the advancement of mankind and human progress. This, Salim said, constituted &quot;an important legacy&quot; for the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are, therefore, leaving the United Nations with dignity and honor and with the satisfaction of having given your best in the promotion of the ideals and objectives of the United Nations,&quot; Salim said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An embassy official told PANA that they have been &quot;faced with an increasing number of Ethiopian doctors and other medical applicants for a year now wishing to work in South Africa&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that as a matter of principle the department did not recruit doctors and other medical staff from developing countries which were, themselves, in short supply of such trained personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said &quot;a great number&quot; of trained medical personnel from many African countries have been asking to work in South Africa, particularly since Cuban doctors were recruited in 1995 to serve in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The new United States Ambassador to Zambia, Arlene Render, urged President Frederick Chiluba on Friday to maintain the country's democratic process by allowing free expression, tolerance of differences and the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting her letters of credence to Chiluba she said that Zambia had in 1991 placed itself in the forefront of Africa's political and economic transformation which should not be allowed to collapse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The building blocks for political stability were put in place in 1991 with your election in the first multiparty democratic election...often these pillars (of democracy) are attacked from one quarter or another but under no circumstances must we allow the pillars to fall,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and other western donor nations, which have backed Zambia's political and economic reforms, have withheld balance of payments aid to Lusaka. They have criticized Chiluba's government for allegedly deviating from the principles of &quot;good governance,&quot; which is part of the criteria for their aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donors have been opposed to the country's latest constitutional amendments which bar first generation Zambians from becoming president. The amendment has affected the country's first executive president, Kenneth Kaunda, who had Malawian parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba told Render Friday that Zambia was evolving its own concept of democracy which could not be implemented in the country's short period of independence from Britain in 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the democratization and economic reforms Zambia had embarked on were irreversible as they offered the best hope for the development of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Render, 53, has served as ambassador to the Gambia, deputy chief of mission in Ghana and Congo, and as consular-general in Jamaica, in addition to several other appointments within the state department in Washington D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She takes over from Roland Kutchel who has been re-assigned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - If you're like the many typical inland readers of this newspaper, and have already joined the lemming rush to some or other overpriced holiday resort, you have my sympathy. Among other masochist pursuits like fighting for parking, fighting for beach-space and fighting for fast foods, you are no doubt also fighting the withdrawal symptoms that come with being away from the Internet for more than a weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's not much I can do to help you catch up on your e-mail, unless your service provider offers roaming facilities, but I can help you find a place where you can reconnect to your favourite indulgence, the World Wide Web.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm talking, of course, about Internet Cafes, those walk-in, one-stop coffee-and-surf outlets that are springing up across the land. With luck, you're reading this before you leave, and have just enough time to fire up the old silicon engine and call up the online edition of PCReview at http: &nbsp;//www.'mg.co.za/mg/pc/pcrevie1.htm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There you'll find the first comprehensive listing of Internet cafes in South Africa, with a nod to Namibia and even Egypt along the way. The listing will direct you to Internet cafes in Ballito, Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Port Elizabeth, Alberton, Bloemfontein, Pietersburg and the Vaal Triangle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What you won't find there are two more Internet cafes I've uncovered in the heart of Africa, as well as one in the very heart 'of the holiday rat race, the 'Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But first, to calmer pastures, such as the Mbabane Internet Cafe, which you'll find in Shop 4, Omnicentre, Allister Miller Street, opposite the old High Court in Mbabane. You'll also find it on the web at http://icafe.co.  sz/icafe/, where it proudly resides as the first and only Internet cafe in Swaziland with public access to e-mail and the web. The cost is equivalent to typical South African cybercafes, at E10 (The emalangeni is equivalent to the rand) for half-an-hour and E25 a month for an e-mail account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A little further north, the first Internet Cafe in East Africa does not have a formal name, but is run by one of the country's largest Internet service providers, Africa Online. Their home page can be found at http://www.  africaonline.co.ke/, and their coffee and public Internet access can be sampled at Diamond Systems Leisure Centre in Rattansi House on Koinange Street, Nairobi. So much for the civilised world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in Cape Town, you may have to fight your way through the kids, Pagad and the cops to get to the Waterfront, but once there, try Dockside Internet at Level P3, Portswood Square. 'They charge R12 for a half-hour, with e-mail accounts R25 per month. Visit their web page at http://www.dockside.co.za, but don't blame me if your modem can't find parking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the fight for the commercial TV licence heats 'up, bidders are closing their doors to the press. Gillian Farquhar and Jacquie Golding-Duffy report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bids have already begun for the commercial television licence to be awarded by the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), but most contenders are shrouding their plans in secrecy as the race heats up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Written submissions must be in by the end of March 1997. These will be followed by public hearings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA is promising to issue a television licence before the end of next year, hopefully September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulator has investigated three scenarios in their proposed policy framework for the private television licence: a national service, a network of three regional stations and a national service with provincial windows. As with radio licences, the ownership must include people from historically disadvantaged groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parameters set out by the IBA in its proposed policy framework are that the television service must be available to the majority of South Africans, it must provide news and information, must reflect provincial diversity, provide programming for children, reflect South African identity, culture and character and contribute to the development of South African languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed with all these necessary requirements, Community Television Network (CTN) is the latest bidder to enter the television fray. It will be competing against Station for the Nation which is Moribo Investment's television subsidiary and former South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) head Quentin Green's planned station, Free-To-Air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to consortium representative, Vanessa du Plessis, CTN has formed a 'very large and powerfully based consortium that includes a black empowerment component and international partners'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Plessis argues that CTN's bid is 'unique in structure' and will benefit the South African economy as well as contribute to improving the quality of TV production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it seems that it will take more than simply a 'unique' structure to convince the IBA to award CTN the licence, especially since its competitors also boast the necessary ingredients insisted upon by the IBA: a black partner, female representation and catering in most aspects for the previously disadvantaged by way of training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have found solutions to the various problems the SABC has with reaching the majority of people in most of the official languages,' said Du Plessis, adding that CTN believed it was well-placed to get the licence as 'we're already involved in TV broadcasting through our existing operation CTN Direct TV'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broadcasting experience Du Plessis refers to is Direct TV's pre- recorded tapes which they show to niche market audiences. CTN's Direct television channels include a stokvel channel aimed at emerging black markets; an inter-city channel targeting passengers; a store channel; a workers' channel; and the Africa Wild channel being launched internationally to reach the tourist market</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Du Plessis described her team's broadcast experience as 'extensive', adding that its international partner would play a role in staff training which would take place locally and abroad and would begin once the IBA's position paper and regulations for the TV licence were finalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We will be seeking to truly empower black people in large numbers and will not use black empowerment as window-dressing.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Plessis says she hopes the IBA would go for the most financially stable bid. 'The licence holder should be able to run a healthy financial station and still leave room for the SABC ' we've been particularly careful to protect the SABC's revenue stream with our intended concept and hope the IBA will look at that together with our strong empowerment and expertise component.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike CTN, Moribo's Station for the Nation was not eager to divulge any of its plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Station for the Nation's newly appointed development manager Gladwin Marume refused to comment on the broadcast experience of his team, saying negotiations with concerned parties were still ongoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, like Du Plessis, Marume played the 'black empowerment' card saying: 'Black empowerment and human resource development are key elements to a successful bid.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thebe Investment's subsidiary, Moribo Investments, and film and entertainment company, Interleisure, own 60% and 20% respectively of Station for the Nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moribo Investments is, however, looking for equity partners to buy 40% of its stake and is understood to be approaching trade unions, black-owned companies and women's organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian station Nine Network is the company's 20% equity partner.  'Station for the Nation will begin recruiting and training staff in a few month's time and equity partner Nine Network will be heavily involved in this, ' Marumo says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an IBA insider, former Pan Africanist Congress politician !Khoisan X may become a partner in Station for the Nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third competitor, Free-to-Air, also remained tight-lipped regarding its bid, refusing to respond to repeated requests by the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed that consortium representative Greene has approached several black-owned companies including Real Africa Investment Limited, World-Wide Investments and Kagiso Trust Investments in search of further investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also understood that he has approached black women-led empowerment grouping Nozala (which is involved in the bid for an MW licence in Gauteng for Afrikaans talk radio ' Punt op Mediumgolf), as well as the Mineworkers' Investment Company (owner of Radio Highveld together with Primedia) to invest in Free-To-Air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to IBA officials, a fourth party has shown 'strong interest in the industry and may soon be joining the fray in making a bid for what is likely to be a strongly contested TV licence'.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Former Vlakplaas commander Dirk Coetzee sees himself as action hero Steven Seagal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which television programmes do you watch most often and why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any and all sport. It depends where the sport is being broadcast. Either I watch on M-Net or SABC and sometimes I watch both channels, flipping with my remote control from one channel to the next. I enjoy watching rugby, boxing and soccer in particular.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which book have you recently read that you would recommend?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm a very bad reader and have never, believe it or not, read a book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which radio stations do you listen to and why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio Jacaranda mostly because of the great variety of music. The rest of the time it depends who is in the car with me. When it's my one son, we listen to Radio Tuks. When the other son is in the car, we switch to FM Stereo and when my wife's in the car, we listen to cassettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you surf the World Wide Web of the Internet?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No ' I don't even own a computer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is your favourite advertisement and why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M-Net's 'We won't stop the magic at all'. It's brilliant with all the animals singing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which newspapers and magazines do you regularly read?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I receive Beeld every morning. I also read the Sowetan, Mail &amp; Guardian, City Press, Sunday Times and Sunday Independent, among others...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you could be any film star or fictional character, who would you be and why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Definitely Steven Seagal because I hate losing and I believe if you do your job you have to do it properly. Seagal does his job well and that is why I enjoy his movies. He always wins and I can appreciate his drive towards perfectionalism (sic). I hated Rocky I and Rocky II ... Sylvester Stallone is not my type of hero.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There were stories to remember and some that editors just wanted to forget. Jacquie Golding-Duffy reports on the highs and lows in the media industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was certainly an eventful year for the print media, with several editors admitting to a series of high notes as well as major booboos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some editors had inaccurate front page stories they would rather forget, many said they experienced a learning curve and were surprisingly highly critical of the media's behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sowetan's editor, Mike Siluma, says the media has to 'seriously examine its role' as the many problems it has encountered with the government and politicians stemmed from a 'lack of clarity on the function of the media in our new dispensation'.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siluma says the years' news highlights were definitely the Bantu Holomisa saga followed by the Sarafina II debacle. Both these stories, he says, struck at the heart. Why? 'Because they showed us what kind of society we want or don't want to live in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'With Holomisa it exposed our electorate system and raised several ethical questions on the ways in which we fund our political parties in our electoral system. Also, it showed that other African National Congress and Cabinet members have to be very careful following Holomisa's expulsion.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regards to Sarafina II, Siluma says the story raised the issue of politicians' accountability to the general public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Sowetan's biggest grovel, Siluma admitted that the newspaper's front page lead article accompanied by photographs of the country's spies included an innocent victim ' Paula Volschenk, a sports dietician and business woman and not a spy at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Her picture was included by pure accident alongside that of spies like Craig Williamson. We had to then apologise,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Press editor Khulu Sibiya agrees with Siluma that the biggest story of the year was Holomisa's tussle with ANC executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Holomisa ruffled the feathers of the untouchables and was the first to challenge the hierarchy of the ANC and that of the president himself. One could not ignore him (Holomisa) at every stage of his briefing to the media.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibiya argues that Holomisa's claims at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that Minister of Public Enterprises Stella Sigcau received bribe money in the former Transkei homeland, 'revealed a lot ... especially that the ANC is not as democratic as they claim and that they prefer that certain things are not mentioned'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Press's biggest booboo involved apologising to 15 academics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We ran a story about fake degrees at the University of Zululand, stating that the list of names we published was linked to the person responsible for the illegitimate degrees. However, it never happened and the 15 people listed did in fact have authentic degrees or were not at all involved.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Day editor Jim Jones says the biggest story for him was the Pearsons deal. 'The deal expresses a confidence in the country and Times Media publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'That aside, Holomisa and Sarafina II were essentially the two biggest stories which illustrate how the ANC is coming to grips with the realities of running a country.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booboo of the year for Business Day was a front page article stating that Telkom chairman Dikgang Moseneke was going to resign when in fact he had no such plans, causing many red faces at the daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the editor of The Star, Peter Sullivan, the best story of the year was the Eugene De Kock trial. Also, Holomisa, serial killer Moses Sithole , South Africa winning the African Cup of Nations, former Springbok Rugby captain Francois Pienaar being axed and Mandela announcing that he won't be up for re- election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Star's mistake was reporting that Minister of Foreign Affairs Alfred Nzo would be leaving parliament as Mandela was reshuffling his cabinet.  However, this was not true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Sullivan, another blunder was losing the court case against Caxton, which won an Appellate Division ruling forcing Independent Newspapers to shut down all their regional supplements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Times editor Moegsien Williams says People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) was the story for 1996. 'Apart from the fact that it is a Western Cape story, it is one of a series of new South African stories which is indicative of the change in society causing all kinds of contradictions to emerge.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams says the newspaper's biggest blunder was calling Winnie Madikizela- Mandela, Winnie Madikizela-Matanzima. The blunder was highlighted on a late night television show, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams argues that his general complaint about the press is our failure in telling the unfolding South African story and contextualising it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are very good at covering events as they happen and doing the follow- ups, but we fail to fully explain the implications of certain decisions taken in parliament. What do these decisions mean to the ordinary Mr and Mrs Witbooi in Beaufort West?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday Times editor Brian Pottinger found the Truth and Reconciliation Commission the overall story of the year as it 'forced all of us to confront our past'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the final settlement of the constitution, the pressures on the rand/'state of the economy and the question of the government's macro- economic plan were all good stories for1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Politically it was a year of the ANC settling into power with the Holomisa, Winnie Mandela and Patrick Lekota incidents. The story of Sithole, an alleged serial killer, was also a big story although it was underplayed. Also on a human level was the story of Micaela Hunter and her return to her family.  '</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pottinger admitted that the Sunday Times's biggest grovel was to Pienaar as they 'unfairly implicated him in a raucous golfing incident', making out he behaved in a 'boorish' manner. 'We did repeatedly apologise to him.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds: 'Another of our booboos was to trust Ian Woodall to have sufficient leadership skills to take a South African team to the top of Mount Everest. It was a great story but it did not happen the way we planned.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On what the media did wrong this year, Pottinger says that we still do not place enough emphasis on the training of reporters in an effort to ensure that 'we do not make silly, avoidable and sometimes damaging mistakes'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beeld editor Johan de Wet agrees with Pottinger that Micaela Hunter was a big story as it was Beeld's reporters who captured an exclusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He could not think of any serious damage that Beeld has inflicted. 'But in terms of general booboos of the year, it must go to Minister of Health Nkosazana Zuma who tried to convince us that Sarafina II was funded by foreign aid.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp;Guardian's highlight was the Hezekiel Sepeng scoop when the 800m Olympic silver medallist was asked to cheat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&amp;G's blunder was when it announced the death of left-wing publisher Ravan Press 'and paid tribute to its achievements' only to discover reports of its demise were greatly exaggerated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Larry Elliott argues that the dragooning of 'smaller nations by the World Trade Organisation into liberalisation can only benefit richer members</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STAFF at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) know when their boss is pleased with them. Renato Ruggiero beams his big Italian smile and says: 'You have made well your work.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sunny side of Ruggiero was evident last week when the WTO ended its first ministerial conference with a show of unity and a clear 'programme for a further round of trade liberalisation at the turn of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By harnessing the forces of globalisation to the cause of free trade, the WTO director general is confident that the future will bring rising 'prosperity. He has a dream of putting a phone in every small village, of plugging the world into the information superhighway.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubting Ruggiero's evangelical zeal. It has to be recognised, too, that the WTO now wields tremendous clout. It is also a step in the right direction, providing weaker nations with a system based on rules rather than economic muscle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor can it be disputed that free trade can be good for consumers. There are plenty of cases where prices have tumbled after inefficient state monopolies were opened up to a blast of foreign competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, after all, is what the international division of labour is about.  'Two countries stand to gain from concentrating on what they are good at and trading with each other. 'That, at least, is the theory. The reality is a lot more difficult, not least because every country in the world, whatever its state of development, is being asked to fit the same model at a frantic pace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small countries are being dragooned into a liberalisation process so rapid that there was a strong undercurrent of thought at last week's meeting that globalisation is merely the rich countries looking after themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scepticism is well-placed. While ministers from Senegal and Barbados were speaking to a largely empty hall, the Americans and the Europeans were stitching together a deal to open up the global market in information technology (IT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IT negotiations underlined a simple fact: for all their talk, the European Union and the United States are not on a crusade for free trade at all. The doctrine of classical free trade stipulates that cutting your tariffs is a good thing, whatever other countries do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In truth, the US, the EU and Japan are old-fashioned mercantilists who believe that trade is a trial of strength in which the biggest benefits in terms of jobs and growth go to those with the most clout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big players, naturally, have a different approach if a smaller country dares to suggest that a big transnational should be denied access. That sort of protectionism has to be stamped out, even if it means the smaller country is thereby prevented from building up its own industrial base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The counter-argument is that protectionism is, without question, disastrous for jobs and growth. Economists need look no further than the Smoot-Hawley tariff, introduced in the US in 1930, to show conclusively that protectionism equals depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, that argument looks less good when held up to the light. The US tariff had been tripled to 40% in the aftermath of World War I, yet productivity and growth soared in the 1920s. The reason, according to revisionist US economists, is that income taxes were cut, increasing the spending power of domestic producers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, the Smoot-Hawley tariff was accompanied by a swingeing income- tax increase, and it was this that caused the slump. It is not free trade that delivers productivity gains and growth but ferocious internal competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an argument that cannot be dismissed out of hand. The United States's share of exports in gross domestic product has doubled in the past 20 years but productivity growth has fallen. Growth has been sluggish and real wages have dropped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here we come to a final point. Even if the increase in trade boosts overall global output, how can we be sure that the gains from that growth are distributed fairly?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, if the growth has a high but unquantified environmental cost, does it actually represent greater prosperity at all?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As ever, the rich North wants it all. It wants open access to every market while protecting its own agricultural and industrial interests; it wants the South to export like mad to pay off its debts; and it wants developing countries to raise the level of worker rights. And all this must be achieved at zero cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is some hope. Developing countries such as India, Pakistan and Brazil are becoming quite powerful WTO players and are refusing to be pushed aside.  But it is a slow process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trinidad and Tobago Minister of Trade Mervyn Assam put it nicely when he said: 'While it is no doubt important to put a phone in every village, many of us here today have far greater responsibilities to our villages. We must put a school, put a road, put a health office, put a notice advising of the use of pesticides so as not to jeopardise market access for exportable goods.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a well-aimed rebuke for the WTO's director general. Unless Ruggiero, the WTO and the rich countries of the North address the concerns of countries like Trinidad and Tobago they will not 'make well their work'.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - After years of civil war, Mozambique's hydro-electric plant is being refurbished for R575-million. Max Gebhardt reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For nearly 12 years, as civil war ravaged our eastern neighbour, five massive hydro-electric generators, with the power to light up a small city, have been sitting idle ' waiting for the moment when they could return to operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second half of next year, engineers will once again flip the switch on at Cahora Bassa Dam power plant in the northern province of Tete in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that moment nearly 2 000MW of hydro-electric power from the south bank power station on the Zambezi River will be transmitted over 1 400km of power lines to the Apollo substation in Midrand, near Johannesburg.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also mark the end of a mammoth task by the governments of South Africa, Portugal and Mozambique to refurbish and rehabilitate the Cahora Bassa hydro-electric power plant at a cost of R575-million and the Apollo substation at a cost of R60-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present only 1% of Cahora Bassa is being utilised for its own internal operations and the supply of electricity to the towns of Tete, downstream from the dam, and Songo, situated alongside the dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dam and its power station will be operated by Mozambican company Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB) - controlled by the Portuguese government with a minority shareholding held by the Mozambicans - and Eskom in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rehabilitation of the hydro-electric dam should give one of the world's poorest nations a sorely needed kickstart to its economy. But it will have to pay Eskom for the right to the power it produces in its own backyard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial agreement drawn up between HCB and Eskom was for the hydro- electric station to supply South Africa with just under 2 000MW. This was because South Africa was the only viable market that could justify the development of a project as massive as that envisioned at Cahora Bassa in 1969.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this supply was interrupted after only three years by the civil war, and by 1982, transmission of power from Cahora Bassa ceased as the power lines and towers were extensively damaged and mined as the conflict intensified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the executive director of HCB at Cahora Bassa Dam, Oliveir Costa, roughly 50% of the 900km of power lines in Mozambique were destroyed during the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This was one of our main concerns when we started working on the power plant last year, as large sections of the power lines had been mined,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The work on the transmission lines is going quite fast considering the difficulties we have faced,' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The work will cost an estimated R138-million, of which two-thirds was required to repair damaged transmission lines, and a further R44-million was spent by HCB to remove landmines from the lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HCB is hoping to recover these amounts when the three main players at Cahora Bassa sit down to renegotiate a new tariff structure, that Eskom will have to pay, for the resumption of power from the hydro-electric dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existing tariff structure was last negotiated in 1988 and an Eskom representative said talks on a new payment would only begin in earnest next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revenue gained by HCB will be used by the Portuguese government to repay loans negotiated for the construction of the Cahora Bassa Project in the early 1970s and provide Mozambique with funds for agricultural and industrial projects planned for the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also go some way to allowing HCB to recoup the estimated R4,8- billion it spent on maintaining the power station during the civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of the project's completion in the early Seventies, Eskom did not have any real need for the energy generated at Cahora Bassa ' it doesn't even now, as the state electricity supplier still has excess capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It justified its need by maintaining that not only would it free internal water supplies for other industrial, commercial or domestic needs but it would also obviate the need to build additional coal-fired power stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, in early 1991 Eskom decided to cede 500MW to Zimbabwe, in view of the growing shortage of power in Zimbabwe and Eskom's excess capacity. In May 1984 in Cape Town, the supply contracts were amended in recognition of the independence of Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskom undertook to wheel an upper limit of 200MW through its Komatipoort line for distribution in Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This move has been welcomed by Mozambican Vice-Minister of Energy Castigo Langa: 'The access to power will allow Mozambique to become eligible for various new investments ' like the proposed development of an aluminum smelter in Maputo. This in turn should have a number of other positive spin- off effects, which will allow us to address various social issues facing Mozambique,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alusaf has expressed interest in opening a smelter in Mozambique. This availability of power at low cost will hopefully help trigger an upsurge in the growth of light and medium industries and further development of the region surrounding the dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rehabilitation of Cahora Bassa will also go a long way towards the development of a Southern African power grid, which will encompass the countries from the Southern African Development Community and stretch as far north as Zaire. Eskom generates some 85% of the electricity produced in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Langa, there are a further 100 potential sites for hydro- electric power in Mozambique. The development of these sites could provide some relief to the impoverished nation, where blackouts in the capital Maputo are still a frequent occurrence, as its power plants were virtually all destroyed by the civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mozambican economy is expecting its inflation to end below the 22% target for 1996, down from 40% in 1995. Langa said they were forecasting growth of at least 5% this year and were aiming at 7% for next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its Parliament began debating its 1997 Budget this week and put next year's spending at 8,196-billion 'meticais (R3,35-billion) of which 42% will be earmarked for education and health.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The triumvirate of car hire power is set to be broken with the re-emergence of international rival Hertz into the overcrowded South African market in 1997, but industry insiders already expect the company to tout the same prices as current leaders Budget, Avis and Imperial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicola, who answers the toll-free line at Avis, said: 'The top three keep the same prices.' She didn't add that these prices are almost double what the smaller companies charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a tremendous choice of car hire in South Africa, each with a stack of add-ons that no one warns you about at the time of hiring. And, because the only simple way to hire a car is with a credit card with a large limit, the user signs away her or his rights and hopes there does not have to be too much of an argument later.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the basic cost of a small car for 24 hours' use in Cape Town. The figure I'm quoted starts at R55 a day and 59 cents/km. As, bar a short trip within Cape Town, I'm only travelling between airport and city, the cost including 95km of driving, with VAT, should be R118,85.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, that's before the extras. The unexplained R6 contract fee, R8,77 which seems to be for picking the car up at the airport, the compulsory R31 insurance. And at no stage is a visitor to Cape Town told there is no obvious place to refuel on the way back to the airport. So that's R29,36.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My final bill for a day's hire in the Mother City came to R216,92. I used Economy ' a collection of small companies that work together and cannot afford offices at the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They meet you from your flight and walk you to the car. While you've already given all your details to your travel agent, you have to fill in a form again ' and authorise them to take R2 500 off your credit card if necessary ... in case you steal or damage the car? There is also a ridiculously long checklist of items that come with the car ' I sign it after the young man assures me everything on the list is actually there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you return the car there is no one to meet you and to confirm that there is no damage to the vehicle. It is left in a public carpark with the keys in the glove box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of an A class vehicle (Toyota Corolla 1300 or similar) with Budget was R105 a day and R1,10/km. Thus the same basic cost would have been R223,63 before insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked the travel agent why she only told me about Budget initially and she said, totally unabashed: 'They pay us more commission.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to insurance, what's on offer is not very good from any of the companies.  And it is possible that the insurance on your own vehicle would cover you in some instances for a hire car, but you really need a lawyer to work out that much small print.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever form of insurance you accept, there is also a hefty compulsory excess to pay in the event of a claim ' between about R2 000 and R9 000. Look at the fine print for even more vicious extras. Budget declares: 'A double excess is payable on weekend rentals in the event of an accident/write-off.' That could be an extra R18 000 on your weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, if someone steals the car and crashes it? 'The hirer will be liable for the full damage to or loss of the vehicle in the event of an accident occurring where the vehicle was not being driven by the hirer.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essentially, if anything bad happens to the car there's such a large excess involved, it would be far safer and cheaper not to drive at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comparative rentals for A group cars are: Weel Rent, R58 a day, R30 insurance and 63 cents/km; Panther Rent-a-Car, R59 a day, R30 insurance and 69 cents/km; Avis, R107 a day, R37 insurance, R1,08/km; and Alisa (partner of Hertz), R68 a day, R11 insurance and 85 cents/km</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A junior mining group is boldly entering the 'mining majors' territory. Bronwen Jones reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MINING company Metorex normally keeps a low profile, but its bold moves as the only South African junior to tender and pre-qualify for the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines' privatisation mark it out as unusual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a stack of tender documents piled on his desk, Simon Malone, chief executive of the 21-year-old firm, said: 'We're thrilled that we've pre- qualified.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There appears to be only one ingredient missing. 'Now we must find an English metal trader that wants to throw a whole gob of money into the copper belt.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company is interested in two areas. One is Kansanshi and the other, with its high-grade copper deposit, has to remain confidential at this stage.  Metorex has tendered for both prospects in partnership with exploration companies Randex and Afriore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five different companies have tried to mine one of these Zambian prospects, but it was closed every time. Nonetheless, Metorex is entirely convinced it can succeed where others have failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malone says the super oxide copper ore deposit is 'suitable for a junior with imaginative financing'. It would be operated by a solvent extraction electro-winning process. The 15- to 20-million ton prospect has 2,2% copper and a predicted life of some 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attraction of Zambia lies in a whole list of promises from the government: from free-market policies to liberalised interest rates, abolition of exchange controls and a commitment to 15 years of unchanged tax and foreign exchange policies. The government has privatised 130 companies in the past two years, and many with South African investment are doing exceptionally well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to its Zambian aspirations, Metorex has many other irons in the fire. Most notable is its intention to seek a base metals listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in the first quarter of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To do this, the company is expected to reverse the high-grade Maranda mine into the Rooiberg Tin cash shell, which comes complete with some 300 shareholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maranda mine is located 15km west of Gravelotte, in the hills of the Northern Province's zinc and copper-rich Murchison Range. Metorex has managed the mine since 1991. 'Following the discovery of the 'Romotshidi deposit nearby, Maranda's life is guaranteed well into the next century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Metorex holds options and rights over a distance of 100km in the 'Murchison belt', where it is confident of finding further valuable deposits. A prospecting agreement has already been signed over the Letaba copper zinc mine 40km east of Maranda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maranda is owned by Metorex, Mercantile Bank, the Industrial Development Corporation, Randex and two syndicates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mine employs 300 people, mainly from the local community. 'It has a 215m deep shaft from 'which 6 500 tons of ore a month 'are taken. It is the highest grade base-metal mine in South Africa and produces 15% of the entire zinc 'concentrate production for the country. The zinc is sold on to Zimcor 'and the copper to O'Okiep Copper Company in Namaqualand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From other operations, Metorex sells manganese dioxide to Anglo American and Anglovaal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Towards the end of next year, Metorex is also looking to list a coal junior.  It took over what Malone describes as 'the debacle of the Side Minerals' coal project, which took a year to get into a respectable condition'. The plant is now operating at design capacity and a significant 'big brother' is to become involved. Malone would not be drawn on the nationality of the expected investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metorex's other coal interests include Leeuwfontein Mine and Bankfontein Opencast mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its headquarters in downtown Johannesburg, Metorex is entirely South African, but it has operations in all of Southern Africa's immediate neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malone feels that Metorex is in a unique position in South Africa, particularly with its base-metals expertise. Apart from a host of small diamond mining organisations, 'there is no interest in juniors in this country', says Malone. 'Even the geology of the country is against it.' But he believes: 'The time of the juniors is coming.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financially, the time may not be quite right, because there is a perception in the market 'that juniors are a bunch of skelms (crooks) and profiteers', Malone says. But the majors are going offshore, leaving a void in development.  He adds: 'Structurally the country, the industry, has got to change and it is now changing.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A junior is a company which usually takes on projects of less than 'R50- million, employs less than 500 people and is not technologically complex.  Juniors in opencast mining might move 60 000 to 70 000 tons of ore a month or, in underground operations, only some 10 000 to '15 000 tons a month</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It's not all doom and gloom on the economic front, but the government must start putting its policies into practice to boost confidence, writes Madeleine Wackernagel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hindsight, as the economic fraternity learnt this year, is an exact science.  To a man - and woman - they got it badly wrong in 1996, but then nobody anticipated the currency crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year ago, we were looking forward to interest-rate cuts, strong growth, and a dollar/rand exchange rate of R3,50. In reality, the opposite happened.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody is making the same mistake this time. Caution is the watchword for 1997. The rand will stay weak; the economy will slow down to an average 2% year-on-year growth; inflation will remain below 10%, and hopefully, the balance of payments will turn around, leaving scope for an upswing in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much for the fundamentals. What about sentiment, that great havoc- wreaker in 1996?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confidence had a rough ride this year; the post-election Indian summer became a veritable Arctic winter virtually overnight. And unless that changes, South Africa is in for another tough year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Dr Azar Jammine of Econometrix: 'The cause of the turnaround in sentiment is difficult to identify, because even though the current account deficit was getting out of hand towards the end of 1995, the money kept pouring in, keeping the rand artificially buoyant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But once the first shock hit the markets in February, there was no turning back. First (Chris) Liebenberg resigned (as finance minister), then disenchantment with the government's macro-economic strategy set in. One thing just led to another, and now we're left with a situation where nobody believes Gear (Growth, Employment and Redistribution) will work unless the government takes some firm steps to implement it.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First off the block should be privatisation. Some movement is expected in the first quarter of next year, with Aventura, Sun Air, Telkom and the Airports Company top of the list, but nobody is predicting an outright sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Foreign investors,' says Jammine, 'are very unforgiving of any signs of dithering. As it is they're all asking why the government continues to pussy- foot around the issues of lifting exchange controls and privatisation.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And therein lies the key to South Africa's misfortunes in 1996. Foreign investors were no longer as well-disposed towards us as in 1994 and 1995; initial scepticism in the market became a self-fulfilling prophecy as the government continued to issue platitudes rather than policy directives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The overseas investors were no longer willing to accept the same old excuses; after all, they don't owe us anything. But it took a long time to sink in. South Africans, including 'government ministers, had been basking for so long in this aura of achievement after the elections. What they didn't realise was that the real task 'still lay ahead ' indeed, still does,' comments one senior economist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the good run of the past two-and-a-half years, a bottoming-out of the economy is inevitable. Nobody is talking of recession, but a great deal will hinge on developments in the balance of payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without exception, the economists canvassed by the Mail &amp; Guardian predicted a boost for the balance of payments, with a healthy export market, buoyed by continued currency weakness, narrowing the current account deficit from its projected R10-billion this year to around R4-billion to R5-billion in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Budget deficit is also on track, and expected to meet the target 5,1% of gross domestic product for 1996/97, falling to 4% in 1997/98. Spending has increased at a rate higher than estimated, but so has revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, private consumption expenditure is expected to drop sharply, as high interest rates bite into credit demand. So there is room to cut rates, at least once ' possibly twice, to 18,25% ' in the second half of next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much depends on the rand, though. If it should hit the skids, import prices will feed through to inflation, in turn undermining prospects for lower interest rates. But the optimists outnumber the pessimists. Most economists see next year as one of consolidation, building the foundation for an upswing in 1998 and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that vision to become reality, however, the government must play a firmer role in guiding the economy, not just talking about it. What has been missing this year is a substantial package of measures to attack the economic rot on several fronts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, we've had ad hoc interest-rate rises, frequently a case of 'too little, too late', and various statements on exchange controls and privatisation, but no timetable or blueprint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Nico Czypionka, chief economist at Standard Bank: 'We cannot afford to continue with policies made in dribs and drabs. State assets don't have to be sold off overnight, but a timetable would go a long way to reassuring the markets and tempting back foreign investors. We need to start working to very precise principles; the government's objectives have become blurred in the past year.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a deepening sense of frustration that the government is not getting its message across successfully, either internally or in foreign markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The private sector cannot do the government's work for it ' ministers have to get out there and tell investors what direction they're going in and what progress they're making. We need a package of measures that can be easily tracked,' says an analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot will be riding on Minister of Finance Trevor Manuel's Budget next March, as a platform for the government to re-establish its commitment to privatisation and lifting exchange controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the South African Chamber of Business has added its voice to the call for a champion for Gear: 'The Budget will provide an important opportunity for the government to send a clear message of commitment to its Gear strategy. Such a message would strengthen the government's credibility in the eyes of those who have welcomed the Gear strategy but have questioned the ability of the government to implement it.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In 1996, South Africa's international relations went on a roller-coaster ride. The country's multi-lateral approach to global affairs produced a number of successes, the high point of which was probably in April, when South Africa hosted the ninth meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also significant is the progress in South Africa's nuclear diplomacy, and its presidency of the Southern African Development Community. Bilaterally, President Nelson Mandela went on triumphant visits to Britain, France and Germany.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A low point was the debacle around Nigeria, while the apparent non- performance of the United States-South Africa binational commission and the related wrangle around the Armscor case must rank a close second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some would argue that the government has opted for 'delayed response' foreign policy-making and implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This perception flows from observing the rather slow development of a mandate for the negotiations with the European Union; the contradictory development of South Africa's China policy; the unclear response to the crisis in the Great Lakes area; and the low-profile treatment of obvious human-rights violators (such as Indonesia and Morocco).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Factors behind these perceptions include primarily the persistent claim that South Africa is attempting to develop a foreign-policy orientation in a vacuum. This refers to the absence of vision and leadership; and a clearly defined national interest. The argument is that South Africa has not found its role in the world, and furthermore, that its leadership is either not competent (in the case of its foreign minister) or ill-informed and driven by an antiquated understanding of global affairs (in the case of its president).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is compounded by the lack of consensus of what ought to underlie the country's 'national interest' ' including perhaps a judicious blend of trade interests and commercial values, and human rights and democratic values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of South Africa's recent announcement of its new China policy, a huge cry went up from Parliament and civil-society interests: where was the consultation? Why wasn't the foreign ministry, or the Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs not properly informed beforehand (or not fully involved in the decision)? What this criticism and perceptions refer to is the lack of clear and consistent internal decision-making structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics do not always factor in the constraints policy-makers experience, the genuine efforts they make to speed up decisions and the attempts they make to facilitate the implementation of decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, and at least in my analysis, significant progress has been made by our foreign affairs policy-makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Affairs Department's deputy director general for multi-lateral affairs, Abdul Minty, recently remarked that 'While it is true that the Department of Foreign Affairs under the previous regime did operate in a secretive fashion, it is being transformed and there are real attempts to reach out to the media in particular.' This is an encouraging statement, but more needs to be done to share information and solicit input from civil society. How?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Affairs' Director General Rusty Evans this month released a report on the outcome of a workshop (billed as 'the first national consultative foreign-policy seminar') convened by his department in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of democratic South Africa's perceived strengths and weaknesses, the workshop identified challenges to its foreign policy, nine of which, in my view, can be seen as constituting the research agenda for South Africa's evolving foreign policy ' probably for the duration of the present administration's mandate (until 1999). These are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Formulating a foreign policy framework based on national consensus, partly through ongoing and wider consultation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Developing consensus on what South Africa's national interest should be;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Reaching clarity on South Africa's stance on human rights;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Reconceptualising South Africa's leadership role in Southern Africa, including the role of non-governmental organisations;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Analysing the question of the unipolar world and the global economy, including the promotion of positive South-South relations;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Establishing a non-elitist advisory council which would allow regular consultation between civil society and government regarding contentious issues and other foreign policy matters; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Improving governmental decision-making processes, including enhanced co- ordination with other government departments, and the addition of a policy planning unit within the foreign ministry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Subsidy cuts to tertiary education institutions are far more serious than they at first appear, argues Brenda Gourley, vice-chancellor of the University of Natal (Durban)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been a great deal of news coverage about the subsidy and financial-aid cuts to universities. Organisations all over the world suffer reverses of fortune and trim their sails accordingly. What is different about universities?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me first explain the cuts in financial aid to students. For several years the tertiary sector has been expecting the establishment of a National Student Financial Aid Scheme. Such a scheme would be endowed sufficiently to address the problems of indigent students. Funders who have been giving ad hoc amounts to individual institutions have stopped doing so in the expectation that they will be asked to contribute to this fund.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students (and the institutions) are now stranded in a limbo where the national fund is not established and the funders are not giving. The situation is so bad that an institution such as my own is unable to assist even those returning students who have been successful in their examinations, much less new entrants. This is an untenable situation in a country where there is a desperate shortage of trained personnel and an enormous investment has already been made in these young people. They too, and their families, have made sacrifices to come this far and unlike the 'customers' of other organisations, they are not going to stoically accept the situation. They have a political voice and they will make it heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the institutions themselves? Less than three weeks before the beginning of their financial year they are informed that they will have to make such substantial cuts in their operating expenses that it is clear drastic measures need to be taken if they are to balance their budgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The word 'drastic' is used advisedly. At least 70% of expenditure in a university is attributable to staffing costs. Retrenching staff costs money and unlike the rest of the 'public service', no financial assistance is offered by the government to assist with this cost. In any single year (and it is 1997 we are worried about) it would actually increase the monies spent by retrenchment packages being added to the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retrenching staff in a system which, according to the National Commission on Higher Education, is expected to double its student intake in the near future, is not an exercise to be undertaken lightly. It needs to be undertaken in the context of some planning parameters ' which in other systems that have had to restructure, are provided by the Ministry of Education. If it is not done in such a context then a whole range of decisions could be taken where similar or identical disciplines are eradicated in every university, resulting in nobody being able to study in that discipline anywhere in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not in the national interest and would, in my view, intellectually impoverish the country very seriously. The fact is that a systemic view needs to be taken and indeed that is why the National Commission on Higher Education was undertaken, and its recommendations (after due process) need to be implemented in an orderly fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many university staff are highly specialised in a discipline and have chosen a life of scholarship. If they are made redundant, they will not be absorbed into the country's workforce, but will move to universities elsewhere in the world. And when the higher-education sector doubles in size and if and when we need them back, they are unlikely to return. It takes a long time to grow an academic and we neglected this process like so many others in the pursuit of an ideology which has now been crushed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the many other things we neglected, this too is not curable overnight.  It is my view that the biggest long-term crisis facing the higher-education sector is where to find the next generation of academics. With salaries as bad as they are, the best of our young graduates are not pursuing academic careers. Among other things, the loans they have to repay make it almost impossible to do so. The lure of public and private-sector salaries is irresistible. And now they are also exposed to uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do not wish to argue that there are no operating improvements capable of being made in higher education. That would be ridiculous. But there are substantial parts of its expenditure that are highly sensitive to exchange- rates fluctuations which are beyond our control. The library, for example, which is so much at the heart of a university, procures most of its books and journals from abroad and the dramatic decrease in the value of the rand has had an equally dramatic effect on library purchases. Laboratory equipment is equally affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about that other large item in the revenue of the university ' student fees? There is a view in some business circles that fees should dramatically increase. The United States is pointed to as an example of where fees can range from anything up to the equivalent of R100 000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is that the US has a healthy, functioning student financial-aid scheme where students can borrow what they need and the loans are underwritten by the state. We haven't got that and it is a tragedy that the majority of our people are finally able to come to university at the very time when we cannot afford what students elsewhere in the world have come to take for granted ' often free university education and at least adequate state-assisted loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Education Sibusiso Bengu is quoted (Natal Mercury, December 13) as saying that the universities are 'panicking unnecessarily'. It is his ministry which informed us of the subsidy cuts and we are only acting responsibly as we ponder how on earth we are going to find the means to get through 1997 without inviting bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe bankruptcy is something we should face with more equanimity. Would the ministry bail us out? Even the dreaded Margaret Thatcher bailed out a university in Wales that went bankrupt. I, for one, do not see that as an option and I am sure the minister would agree. So my colleagues in universities and technikons remain worried. The higher-education sector is easy to destroy. It takes generations to build again. Let us look after what we have and not wait until it is too late.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Transvaal Bench will be on the light side next year after the Judicial Services Commission last week rejected five of the seven candidates gunning for the division's four vacancies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission selected only two of the applicants: Ivor Schwartzman, SC, and S Snyders, SC, who will become the division's third woman judge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest -advocates MF Noorbhai, SC, B Pandya, SC, MNS Sithole, Professor FR Malan of the Rand Afrikaans University and Rustenburg attorney I Klynsmith - apparently failed to make the grade.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Would court action to prevent the recent tax amnesty 'succeed? Our legal columnist thinks not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has again extended its tax amnesty to non-payers. In essence, this is an invitation to people who have not paid tax, for various lengths of time and often ever, to come forward and put themselves inside the taxation net. In return, the accumulated interest, penalties and ultimately, maybe even arrears tax, are all waived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naturally, this vexes all law-abiding citizens; they have kept this nation economically viable by their industry and taxes for many years now; they pay a high rate by modern standards; they have had to watch billions of rand slip through the tax net by way of a combination of sophisticated tax avoidance, idiotic and corrupt allowances made by the Nats and downright fraud; they know that if every citizen paid his full tax, the marginal rates could easily be reduced, and there would still be tens of billions more rand each year to fund the equalisation of facilities and infrastructure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their grumbling is thus both understandable and justified. But will they, or some of the more energetic minded of them, try to take the belly-aching further? There have been some low mutterings, for example, of court proceedings to prevent the grant of a tax amnesty ' it is not, after all, specifically authorised by the Constitution, unlike the amnesties now being granted at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">English taxpayers had a similar beef about 20 years ago. About 6 000 people who worked in the newspaper industry on a casual (but well-paid) basis had developed a practice of giving false names when collecting their pay. This meant they could not be traced for taxation purposes, and the country lost about '1-million a year. The Revenue authorities believed the most efficient way of bringing them back into the tax net was to strike an agreement with them whereby their arrears tax would be written off, but they would register properly and pay all future taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of small businessmen, incensed at what they perceived to be an unfair advantage granted to the casuals, attacked the decision to strike the agreement and grant the amnesty. They suggested the casuals had been unfairly favoured because they were backed by powerful trade unions. They asked the courts to review the decision and to set aside the agreement. They failed in the first court, won in the court of appeal, and the matter then went to the House of Lords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The small businessmen lost the case ultimately on the technical issue that they lacked 'sufficient interest' in Revenue's decision to strike the agreement and grant the amnesty to the casuals (which would not, in South Africa today, be any impediment to success). Of far more interest, though, is what the judges said about the merits of the application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Wilberforce, for example, recognised that there must be 'a sense of fairness between one taxpayer ... and another ... so that a sense of unfairness may be the beginning of a recognisable grievance'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Diplock was totally dismissive of the contention that the courts had no power to intervene because Revenue officials were answerable only to Parliament: 'They are accountable to Parliament for what they do so far as regards efficiency and policy, and of that Parliament is the only judge; they are responsible to a court of justice for the lawfulness of what they do, and of that the court is the only judge.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House of Lords then did consider the main question, which was whether the Revenue authorities had failed to carry out their duties fairly. The argument was that Revenue was obliged to collect taxes, not to waive them.  But the Lords found that, in the collection of taxes, the Revenue officials had wide managerial powers and that 'they had made a sensible arrangement in the overall performance of their statutory duties ... in the best interests of everyone ... for the agreement reached would be likely to lead ultimately to a greater collection of revenue than if the agreement had not been reached'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African government is faced by the same problem, albeit far greater in scale, and its tax amnesty is motivated by precisely the same considerations; it is therefore difficult to imagine a South African court coming to any different conclusion.</SPAN></P>

Being inlanders, we were very worried when we read in the Mail &amp; Guardian that SA Breweries uses fish goetes to make our favourite brews. But we had a good chuckle when we heard someone from South African Breweries phoned the Mail &amp; Guardian last week to ask if their posters which read 'SAB's fishy brew' were always such a bright yellow. In Cape Town, they were fluttering on a pole right outside SAB's local headquarters. Ai, the cheek of some people!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities refused permission for Pagad's demonstration because they were worried foreigners' would skrik at the sight of all those masked mense and not visit South Africa. With foreign correspondents on the receiving end of police action this often, it looks like Pagad's actions are the least of their concerns.</SPAN></P>

'This will help Telkom's international operating staff provide a better service to customers,' Telkom spokesman Ronell Myburgh said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Really? Does Telkom only employ Christian workers? Does this mean Muslims calling overseas to wish family for Eid and Hindus celebrating Deepavali won't be able to reach their friends either?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they're having a competition in South Africa to find qualifiers for the world Macarena championships in Mexico, and the manne have decided to start a campaign to send Dorianne.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The latest round of permanent appointments to South Africa's judiciary, and in particular the Transvaal Bench, deserves close attention ' not because of those who were selected, but rather for those who were passed over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the seven lawyers who applied for the division's four vacancies, three were white males, three were black males and one was a white woman. After the Judicial Services Commission had grilled the candidates only a white man and a white woman were left.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's decision to leave two posts empty suggests it is anxious to avoid risking the integrity of the Bench while dragging it into the new South Africa. It sends a signal to those judge presidents who may have been over-eager to endear themselves to the new government and have appointed underqualified lawyers to serve as temporary judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the decision also points to the shortage of black lawyers either qualified to become, or interested in becoming, judges. Government officials have privately expressed concern that those black advocates they would like to see become judges prefer to remain at the Bar for the same reasons as their white colleagues: the money is better and, perhaps, because there is a feeling the currency of the judiciary has become devalued. Many long-serving judges are perceived as less able than the counsel who appear before them while some recent appointments have provoked nothing but raised eyebrows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is imperative the judiciary be exposed to the negotiated revolution undergone by the legislature and the executive. But early transformation of the judiciary is unlikely unless there are active and rapid efforts on the part of government to train new judges and make a career on the Bench more attractive. In other countries governments have gone so far as to give advocates tax breaks to encourage them to become judges; a judge's salary does not go very far in paying off the average senior counsel's tax bill for the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Minister Dullah Omar is increasingly seen in legal circles as a man who is strong on consultation, but weak on action. It is a reputation he needs to correct in the new year, particularly where the Bench is concerned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is a basic principle of government, particularly in our democratic age, that one cannot rule without the consent of the people. That is a statement which goes far beyond simple majority rule. The drawn-out conflict in Northern Ireland is testimony to the dangers of imposing the wishes of a majority on a minority. Nelson Mandela's sensitivity to the demands of that minority which is conservative Afrikanerdom points to his understanding of the principle. Which makes the government's recent handling of People against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) perplexing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now more than a year since Pagad was launched. Its survival for such a length of time is surprising and in itself significant. Its leaders ' to the extent that they can be identified behind their masks ' are full of passion, but do not display the organisational or oratorical skills which even a populist movement usually needs to remain afloat beyond the first flush of enthusiasm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public is naturally averse to organisations which are seen to promote chaos on the streets. Peace is a universal aspiration and in normal circumstances the brandishing of guns and flouting of masks is almost guaranteed to rob an organisation of support. The fact that Pagad continues to flourish points to a depth of feeling which demands recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a recognition which was denied twice this week, firstly by the refusal of the authorities to allow Pagad supporters to demonstrate at Cape Town International Airport and then by the statement by police ' in the wake of the airport and Belville clashes ' that they will no longer have talks with Pagad, but will treat it as 'just another gang'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Self-evidently the clashes, in which police officers and others were injured, are to be condemned. The police have arrested a number of demonstrators who were illegally carrying firearms and it is to be hoped that on this occasion, unlike previously, the charges will be vigorously prosecuted. But the dismissal of Pagad as 'another gang' is a nonsense and, if maintained, can only lead to further disturbances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right to demonstrate at the airport was denied by the Department of Transport after both the police and a magistrate had granted permission. The justification for the ban is that such a protest, witnessed by foreign travellers, would convey a negative impression abroad. We would argue the contrary. Such a demonstration could have been held out to foreign visitors on their arrival as evidence that South Africa is not only the world's youngest, but also the most determined democracy. And those tourists heading home ' nursing bruises and denuded wallets as souvenirs of Cape Town's muggers ' could have taken comfort from the demonstration, as evidence that something is going to be done about crime in South Africa. It has to be; the people are demanding it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Foreign envoys attempting to bring an end to the civil war in Burundi believe it may be about to invade Tanzania to hit Hutu rebel bases which have swollen with fighters driven from eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials fear Burundi's overwhelmingly Tutsi army will strike into Tanzania before long in an attempt to prevent the largest rebel group ' the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD) led by Burundi's former interior minister, Leonard Nyangoma ' from re-establishing a foothold after it was routed from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations special envoy Raymond Chretien, EU envoy Aldo Ajello and UN human rights commissioner Jose Ayala Lasso have all visited Burundi in recent weeks. Senior officials among the parties said they sensed a new bullishness within Burundi's army after it joined the Rwandan-led invasion to clear the Hutu refugee camps in Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There are some very worrying signals that the army intends to strike against CNDD bases in Tanzania. After the success against the refugee camps in eastern Zaire, the army does not want to let the rebels off the hook. But it wouldn't be like going into Zaire. The Tanzanian army will not stand by. I think there is a real possibility we will see the Burundian and Tanzanian armies fighting before long. The question is where it leads,' one official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi's military leader, Major Pierre Buyoya, has accused the Tanzanian government of turning a blind eye to the growing CNDD presence on its soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a meeting last month with former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, who is attempting to mediate an end to Burundi's civil war, Buyoya said he was 'concerned' about deteriorating relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania denies it is giving shelter to the CNDD. Tanzania's defence minister, Edgar Maokola Majogo, has warned that any incursion will cost the Burundian army dearly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Any nation or group which will threaten the lives of Tanzanians or plans to launch an attack in Tanzanian territory will militarily be wiped out,' he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa - Emerging on to the steps of his chartered plane, Mobutu Sese Seko, in a leopard-skin hat, looked out happily on the country he has pillaged for 30 years. He was greeted by an enormous roar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of Zaireans rushed under the jet that had flown him to the capital, Kinshasa, this week from exile in France as if they wanted to carry the plane on their shoulders. After nearly a year their 'marshal' had come home. Now the people moved like a dark sea under the silver wings. Two men held up a banner that read 'Mobutu equals solution'.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu (66) declared he had defied doctors' orders to return and promised not to flinch from the crisis facing the country in the wake of a rebel uprising in the east. 'Each time that Zaire has been threatened in the past, I have never pulled back. I will never pull back.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The returning exile was followed by a fleet of planes loaded with washing machines, television sets and video-recorders bought during his convalescence on the French Riviera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the public show of affection there is a vast land seething with resentment and unrest after three decades of corruption, misrule and now armed rebellion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaetan Kakudji, spokesman for Laurent Kabila, president of the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces, said Mobutu's return changed nothing. 'We know he is preparing a counter-attack, but we are confident and prepared to respond. The regime of Mr Mobutu is a sick regime,' he said speaking by telephone from Brussels. 'We need a new man to reconstruct the country.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean state radio had broadcast appeals for residents of Kinshasa to turn out in huge numbers to greet the president ' and they responded in style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neglect does not breed contempt in this country and thousands waited to welcome him home and they streamed on to the tarmac of Africa's most notoriously corrupt airport without hindrance from officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Look how poor these people are,' a foreign businessman in transit said, pointing out that Mobutu is reputed to be the richest man in Africa. 'They have been paid to come here for sure.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's happiness, total happiness,' said Wabasa Gerembo (38) from Kinshasa, as he waited for the plane. 'We know he is living and walking and the joy is shared by all Africans. For 30 years he has won wars, he has always won and he has kept the country together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'What has happened in the east has happened because he's absent and now the enemy are in retreat.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerembo did not look as if he wanted contradiction on Africa's joy. One thing was obvious. The troops that now formed to protect Mobutu were not of the same kind as those who retreated in front of the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were the presidential guard, smartly dressed, well armed and highly disciplined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the president's plane sank through the equatorial haze on to the tarmac, the army pushed back the hordes from the ramp in front of the VIP lounge. Pictures of the president had been re-hung on the incongruously well- painted walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brass bands pounded their way through the thick wall of humanity, happily screaming children crushed against the fences. The joy was real in the warm, summer-damp air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu was met at the bottom of the ramp by two girls waiting with elaborate bouquets of flowers. Wearing a flower-patterned tunic, black trousers and a smile, the president stepped on to the red carpet and made his way to a podium where he raised a black, silver-tipped cane above his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angel Nzenze (20) was beside herself. Her husband was fighting in the east, although she had heard from him the week before. 'I came to welcome the president,' she said. 'He has become back because his health has improved and he's going to bring peace.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The murmurings of a potential coup were nowhere to be heard. Although later, a young man, surrounded by friends, said quietly: 'He is a great man, a great man for the army, but a terrible president.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zaireans may see what they believe to be a competent soldier back in their midst. He had returned complaining that his recuperation had been interrupted, but promising damage to the rebels in the east. 'I have decided to interrupt my stay in France,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side of the airport terminal, a Mercedes shunted into position with armoured cars bristling with anti-aircraft guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever anyone might say about paid crowds, it could not be repeated on the 30km drive into the centre of the city. Thousands of people lined the road, singing and shouting at the people driving by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beautifully and stylishly dressed people mingled with the poor in the run- down city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally the convoy ground into a bottleneck at the gates of Camp Colonel Tshatshi, an army station where the president has one of his many mansions.  For the lucky people let through by the army, a vast buffet had been laid on beside the glorious rapids of the Congo River. There Mobutu stood on the patio and made a 10-minute speech to his people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people's gravest fear, it seemed, was the rebels and their leader aimed his message directly at it. 'I'm not going to disappoint you. I know your expectations and your hopes,' he said. 'Every time our country has been threatened in the past I have never retreated and this time again I will not retreat.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Despite growing demands in Zimbabwe for political reform, President Robert Mugabe has declared that his ruling Zanu-PF party will continue to take precedence over Parliament as far as governing the country goes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe slapped down members of Parliament who had been calling for change ahead of last weekend's Zanu-PF conference held in Bulawayo, reminding them where ultimate power resides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zanu-PF occupies 147 of the 150 parliamentary seats. But a group of restive MPs have recently proposed reforms such as the restoration of the Senate, the removal of appointed MPs, and a limit to the terms a president may serve ' all of which would impact upon Mugabe's sweeping powers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They think things can just be suggested in Parliament and the policy made by Parliament. That is nonsensical,' Mugabe said, repeating a long-held view that his party is sovereign. 'Policy has to be made by the party, by the central committee which is the custodian of our policies.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party was not opposed to change, Mugabe added, citing as an example the introduction of an executive presidency and two vice-presidents in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly ten years on, that structure remains rigidly in place. No debate on the succession to Mugabe (72) was permitted at the Bulawayo meeting. Vice- President Joshua Nkomo (78) appears determined to hang on despite growing signs of infirmity while Vice-President Simon Muzenda (73) shows no sign of going either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his keynote address Mugabe called for 'ideological education' on the country's unique brand of socialism and announcced that Zanu-PF's controversial land acquisition policy would be given new impetus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He brushed aside the recommendations of a report drawn up by the British government which offered donor support for land acquisition on a willing- seller basis and declared he would take the land anyway, without compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same spirit of arbitrary redistribution has guided the party's approach to black empowerment, also a major topic at the conference. Multi-national companies have been invited to offer shares to the government which will then 'warehouse' them until approved entrepreneurs come forward with an offer to purchase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglo American recently parted with 20% of its Bindura nickel mine under this scheme, thus facilitating a work permit for its new managing director, Philip Baum. It still hasn't seen the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics point out that, like land acquisition, Zimbabwe's economic indigenisation policy has been characterised by a lack of transparency and is calculated to empower a well-connected elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was not all plain sailing for the party in Bulawayo. Delegates accused senior party members of fuelling factionalism in an undeclared struggle for power. 'The party is collapsing because of our leaders who are hungry for power and greedy for money,' said one delegate, to applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference also saw renewed attacks on the independant press. Zanu-PF's deputy information secretary, Chen Chimutengwende, said resources would be allocated to the party's information department to counter what he called the 'completely unacceptable propaganda' of the 'opposition press'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government already controls Zimbabwe's broadcast media and owns 90% of its print media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers point out that with a virtual press monopoly and an emasculated civil society, Zanu-PF has been able to dominate national discourse and resist reform of institutions which maintain it in power. This includes allocating itself public funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zanu-PF's secretary for administration, Didymus Mutasa, who describes Mugabe as 'Zimbabwe's king', said last week it was 'unAfrican' to discuss the succession issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Playwright Zakes Mda visits a small town in the Free State in this week's installment of our guest writer series</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Bert Oosthuizen? Just up the street,' says the sweet Afrikaner girl with a ready smile. The throbbing sounds of Maak-Haar-Eina fill the cafe as she serves her black customers with fat cakes and Russian sausages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am on the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) 'consultation trail' in the small eastern Free State town of Wepener. The issue at hand is the installation of Dr Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri as premier of the Free State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do the citizens of small-town Free State think?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blacks want me to talk to their mayor, Lebona Phalatsi, and whites direct me to Oosthuizen, their spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After driving through muddy streets in the rusty corrugated iron shack township of Qibing, I find Phalatsi playing a game of morabaraba with a group of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is not the mayor at the moment, I discover, because he has been suspended by the African National Congress. Then why do the people in the street refer to him as the mayor?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phalatsi gleefully tells me that it is because they do not recognise the suspension. It was imposed on the local branch by the higher regional structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Just as in the case of Terror Lekota where the national executive imposed its will on the provincial structures,' he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His problems, the suspended mayor seems to think, all began with the bust of Kommandant Louw Wepener, which to this day stands proudly in front of the Town Hall. He spearheaded the movement to have it removed and kept in the library because he felt it was an insult to his people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now allegations and counter-allegations are flying in all directions in the town. These include rape, child abuse, and dagga smuggling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phalatsi is appealing against his suspension because he says it is unconstitutional. Disciplinary measures, according to the constitution of the ANC, must be convened 'at the area of the level where the violation was committed'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is accused of instructing people to demolish the low-income houses that the town council was building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I had nothing to do with that,' he says. 'Qibing Building Association actually destroyed the houses. They were protesting against corrupt tendering procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Contracts for building the houses were given to white construction companies even though there are black builders in the township. Although I had nothing to do with the destruction of the houses, I feel that the people who destroyed them had legitimate complaints.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is being persecuted because he is insisting that Louw Wepener's statue must be removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Louw Wepener was a Boer soldier fighting the black people for their land in the last century. He ravaged and savaged the lands of the Basotho people, and was killed at Thaba Bosiu in 1865.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'His statue in De Beer Street, which is our main street, is an insult to black people.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the sake of reconciliation, he says, the bust must not be destroyed, but must be relocated to the library. 'After all, even Terror Lekota removed the statue of Verwoerd,' he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wepener people have very strong ties with the people of Lesotho. They feel that the border between the two countries was arbitrarily drawn through conquest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Wepener is really part of Lesotho,' says Phalatsi, 'I myself have most of my relatives in Lesotho. What do I say to them when they come here where I am mayor and they see the statue of a Boer who persecuted their forebears?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His fellow ANC councillors, Phalatsi says, have betrayed him. They have been 'bought' over by rightwing Afrikaners, and the ANC-led council is now corrupt. During weekends the ANC councillors are invited out for a braai at the farm of the town clerk, an Afrikaner of the old order who 'does not support whatever the ANC is doing'. Now they have joined the Afrikaners in talking against the removal of the statue, and in framing him. Hence his suspension by the regional structures of the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he has been suspended from mayorship Phalatsi is still a town councillor and continues to serve in the branch executive of the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has no intention of giving up his campaign against the bust. He fully supports Sanco and was the treasurer of Sanco Southern Free State before he became mayor. 'My followers and I fully support Sanco's campaign against the Matsepe-Casaburri woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We'll fully participate, but only as individuals. If we participate as ANC branches the NEC will pounce on us, and some of us will be 'redeployed' to the unemployment lines,' he declares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says there is now a culture of fear in the ANC, for the organisation supports people who are corrupt, and punishes those who are trying to rectify the situation. 'If we go on at this rate,' he says, 'in 12 years' time or even less, we'll not be the ruling party.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claims that it is part of his fight against corruption that he now wants to unseat Joseph Mthala, the man who took over the mayorship. He accuses Mthala of being involved in a sordid case of child abuse, abduction and rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wepener police confirm that a 'docket has been opened' against Mthala.  But then, they add, a 'docket has been opened' against Phalatsi too. Charges of dagga smuggling and of 'passing false cheques' are being investigated against him. He is currently on bail, they say, for throwing stones at a woman right in town, and using bad language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find Bert Oosthuizen in his yard which is littered with vehicle engines of all sizes. There are skeletons of heavy-duty trucks and sundry pieces of metal all over the yard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a lean man with a friendly smile and a hand that gives one a tight grip in a warm greeting. He is the chairman of the Ratepayers Association and a member of the federal council of the Freedom Front. 'I am up there with Viljoen,' he boasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he has no problem with the new dispensation, since he wants to be part of the solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There are a lot of decent people in the ANC,' he says. 'I served with them in the Transitional Local Council.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says that Phalatsi is the most capable in the council. 'But he has a mean streak, and is not honest. I know him very well, from the time he was born. He grew up in front of me, his mother was working for my wife. It was my family which comforted her when this boy was born, for he was an albino.  That is why he was named Lebona.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oosthuizen says that the other councillors, even the whites, are incompetent, and the town is in financial difficulties. The services are deteriorating very fast. In the past two months 22 families have left because they see no future in the town. Businesses are closing down, and unemployment is increasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I have lived here all of the 66 years of my life, except for a short stint working for a bank in the then Rhodesia, but now I am selling everything and leaving too,' he laments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Australia, perhaps? Or Canada? 'No, I am going to Bethlehem (in the north-eastern Free State), to farm with my son-in-law. Here I am getting too many problems with the working staff. Now they come with demands for higher salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'And these are people who have worked for me for the past 24 years. Do you think if I had the money I would not pay them higher salaries?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He feels that small Free State towns which used to be self-sufficient in the past will either be a burden for the province, or will become ghost towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oosthuizen agrees with Phalatsi that most of the problems of Wepener emenate from the bust of Kommandant Louw Wepener in De Beer Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says, 'For the harmony of the town I will say take the bust away if most people don't like it. But it is still there because the people of Wepener of all colours want the bust to stay. It is a sign of reconciliation. It is only Phalatsi and his half-brother who want to get rid of it. They once tried to remove it by force, then all of a sudden there were 28 blacks in uniform who said they would protect the bust with their lives. They came from the township.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mantshiyane of Sanco agrees that the problems of Wepener begin with the bust. Sanco feels that the mayor had to understand the political climate first, before he went around 'fiddling' with the bust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You do not win the National Party and the Freedom Front members that way.  He should have started with development instead of the statue. So even the black people of Wepener opposed him. They physically stopped him when he was trying to remove the statue.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mantshiyane is echoed by Nketsi Moleko, a furniture shop saleswoman. 'The statue has been standing here since 1965. Did you ever hear that it has eaten somebody during that time? We have no time for useless quarrels here about statues. We want development.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oosthuizen is confident that the bust will stay. In the meantime he finds himself on the same side with the 'enemy' on the question of Terror Lekota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He fully supports a demonstration against the installation of Matsepe- Casaburri as premier of the Free State, although he may not necessarily participate in it. He did not know about it, and has no mandate from his party to participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The worst thing that can happen to the Free State is taking Lekota away.  He is the most capable man ' black or white ' I ever met, because he is against corruption. He is well liked by the farmer community. He would have been the trump card in Mandela's policy of reconciliation. Why take such a man away?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mantshiyane says the in-fighting in Wepener is typical of what is happening in most small towns in the Free State, such as Ficksburg, Zastron and Bobhouse ' even Bloemfontein. Democracy is not functioning at grassroot level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems all started before the local elections when the higher structures of the ANC imposed their own candidates on lower structures ' 'just as they have done at provincial level with Matsepe-Casaburri'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanco as a watchdog organisation did not run for local elections, but their members ran on the ANC ticket. Sanco considers itself a faithful ally of the ANC, and most of its members are ANC members as well. But it will continue to play its watchdog role outside party politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are not against Matsepe-Casaburri as a person. We are against the fact that she has been imposed on us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are willing to compromise and let Terror go since he has already resigned. But we want our own candidates who have been nominated by us, not the 'sole candidate' imposed on us by the NEC. If we want a woman as premier we have our own Motlalopula Chabaku, the current speaker of the legislature.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feeling among some that the ANC is no longer a mass-based organisation but a corporation with directors who transmit their decisions in a top-down fashion. At all levels the ANC violates its own principle of consultation.  Its unstated policy seems to be that democracy is good for South Africa, except for ANC members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If we do not speak now,' Mantshiyane says, 'in two years' time you will be killed if you try to speak. Now we'll use the same tactics that we used against the apartheid regime. We'll make the Free State ungovernable.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nketsi Moleko puts in the last word. 'For the time being we are putting our problems in Wepener aside, since we are now faced with this big provincial problem, which is really a national problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We don't care if Madiba says he has full confidence in Matsepe-Casaburri.  In any case, when Madiba has full confidence in someone we have reason to worry. He expressed the same full confidence in Alan Boesak, and we all know what happened to him, and in Nkosazana Zuma, even when it was apparent to everyone that something was wrong with the manner in which the Sarafina II debacle was handled.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In December 1959 Benjamin Pogrund covered a PAC conference in Orlando for the Rand Daily Mail. Now he reports on the latest PAC conference</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHORTLY after 1am last Monday the Pan Africanist Congress was transformed from a dying no-hoper into an organisation of spirit and potential. The dramatic change came with the announcement at its fifth annual conference that Bishop Mmutlanyane Stanley Mogoba had been elected unopposed as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A storm of cheering broke out. Many who had despaired that the PAC was 'going down the drain', as one delegate put it, were jubilant. Some even wept, relieved that there was now reason for them to remain in an organisation drifting aimlessly and beset by corruption scandals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That 433 delegates and observers from 105 branches travelled the distance to Thohoyandou, in the far north, most of them at their own expense, reflected their commitment to the PAC. The conference was held in this out-of- the-way venue at the University of Venda because it was free ' crucial for the cash-strapped organisation but hard on members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right from the start of the weekend delegates repeatedly said that the leadership issue was critical. One after the other confided that unless this was resolved, the PAC was doomed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet despite the pivotal importance of Mogoba's election his victory was uncertain until late in the night. Twelve hours earlier he had been one among four runners. Then the field was reduced to him and the president in office, Clarence Makwetu. Pressure on Makwetu to stand down, applied especially by the PAC's military and youth sections, finally prevailed and a new post as national chairman was created for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In accepting the leadership, Mogoba has pushed aside the 36 years of leadership that ranged from inept to crooked and has donned the mantle of Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, the PAC founder-president who, after leading the anti-pass demonstrations on March 21, 1960 which resulted in the Sharpeville massacre, spent the last 18 years of his life in prison and then banishment.  Like Sobukwe, Mogoba is a thinker who speaks quietly but with strength and passion. Like Sobukwe, he has a self-effacing sense of humour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now 63, his record reaches back into the PAC's early years. Trained as a teacher, he was jailed in 1963 for membership of the underground PAC offshoot, Poqo. While in solitary confinement on Robben Island he was called to the Methodist Church's ministry and after his release went on to hold high positions in international Christian bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elected presiding bishop of the Methodist Church of Southern Africa with its nearly 1-million members, he was re-elected three times for a record eight years in office and took the church through the post-apartheid transition years. He resigned earlier this month to be available for the PAC presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He laughed as he told me: 'In the Methodist Church I had ANC, IFP, CP, NP and PAC members. After that, PAC will be easy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the new president he began briskly by offering a hand of friendship: previous contacts with President Nelson Mandela will be revived and the PAC seems open to joining a government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also stressed the common suffering of the past in the anti-apartheid struggle and spoke of a 'patriotic front' with the ANC and the Azanian People's Organisation (if, that is, much remains of this group after the bust- up at its own conference last weekend).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the PAC will also go its own way and Mogoba gave notice to the government that he will be focusing on 'the new South Africa that has been short on delivery'. In his prepared acceptance speech he spoke of 'the plight of the poor, the desperately poor, who had hoped that change was coming. That change turned out to be a mirage.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, such as parliamentary adviser Bennie Bunsee, were even more pointed in their comments, making clear that they intend mounting a serious challenge to the ANC in the 1999 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mogoba returned to the Africanist tenets spelt out by Sobukwe to attack what he said was 'the mother of all myths' ' that the PAC was a racist organisation. There was 'one human race' according to the PAC's original documents. Africa was for Africans ' which meant everyone, whatever their colour, 'who belong here, love their country and love their fellow-men and women'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His emphatic assertion of nonracialism struck a particular chord for me because the last PAC conference I reported was in December 1959 ' a few months, it turned out, before both the PAC and the ANC were banned ' and I experienced a good deal of hostility because of my whiteness. Last weekend was totally different: there was no vestige of unfriendliness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But although the PAC dropped its 'one settler, one bullet' slogan nearly three years ago, several delegates were still wearing tee-shirts carrying the controversial message. 'Why do you have that slogan?' I asked one of them.  Clearly embarrassed, he said: 'What can I do with this tee-shirt? I can't throw it away.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a reminder that not everyone in the PAC might fully understand the non- racism policy, Mogoba made a gentle reference to some of the 'younger' members who 'may themselves have lapsed into unconscious racism'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A particular reason for electing Mogoba to the presidency is his irreproachable honesty. Millions of rands are unaccounted for in the PAC's books and a commission of inquiry which reported to the conference, in what was supposed to be a confidential report but which was leaked to the press, made little headway in tracking down the funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the PAC's self-cleansing was seen in the conference's decision by an overwhelming majority to refer the issue of the funds to the commercial branch of the police. It is believed that the police will be able to carry out a more thorough investigation than possible for a private inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election of a new president, however gifted, will not be enough in itself to give life to a political party which gained only 1% of the votes in the 1994 national elections ' a fact which PAC members defensively say was due to poor organisation and leadership, and severe internal divisions about whether to contest the elections or continue armed struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mogoba will be assisted by an almost entirely new executive which includes businessman and radio personality Michael Ngila Muendane as secretary general and Philip Kgosana as national organiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kgosana, as a 21-year-old university student, led 30 000 people on a march into Cape Town in 1960: it remains to be seen whether, after his years in exile studying and then working for Unicef, he retains the Pied Piper-like magic he displayed then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week ago the PAC was of little account on the national scene. It is still too early to say whether its leaders are correct in believing that there's a current of Africanist belief in the country waiting to be tapped 'and even if this is true, whether they will be able to mobilise resources so that the PAC is able to offer effective opposition to the ANC. But what can be said is that the PAC has turned a corner and deserves to be watched.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Costa Gazides has travelled a long political road from the days when, 32 years ago, he was charged alongside Braam Fischer with membership of the underground Communist Party, to last weekend when he was a delegate to the Pan Africanist Congress conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sharpeville killings in 1960 were a first turning point in his life. He was a medical student at the University of the Witwatersrand and felt he had to do 'something'. So he joined the all-white Congress of Democrats, going from there to the Communist Party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spent more than two years in jail ' in solitary confinement, awaiting trial and serving his sentence. He was also charged with furthering the aims of the ANC. On his release he was banned and later left for Britain on an exit permit to study his medical speciality, public health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next turning point came in 1968 when the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia. It left him 'totally disillusioned' with the Soviet Union, and he had rows with his party colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He drifted around the left, flitting between revolutionary movements, other exiles and ANC dissidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually there was another turning point because while working in Nottingham he met a PAC man in exile, Bennie Bunsee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I found out what PAC stood for. I saw some of the basic documents and came to realise they were not the racist organisation they were made out to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I wasn't consciously looking for a political home but I wanted to continue the fight against apartheid. I was aware there were not many whites in the PAC but it didn't bother me at all. I thought of the whole process in political terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There was some reticence among some PAC members because of my whiteness ' maybe they thought I was a spy. But I came across a great deal of warmth and political understanding that coincided with my own view.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gazides returned to South Africa and remained active in the PAC, in the health field, working in forums preparing for restructuring. He ran unsuccessfully for Parliament in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November last year he was the victim of an outright racial attack, all the more ironic because it happened at the unveiling in Umtata of tombstones of five children murdered by the South African Defence Force. The PAC was involved in the ceremony. As Gazides stood, right palm upraised in the PAC salute, singing the national anthem, a young black man stabbed him three times, narrowly missing his heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAC leaders told Gazides he had to lay charges. When the young man appeared in court the only explanation he gave was: 'He is one of the oppressors.' The man was jailed for five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of those 'Believe it or not' twists, it transpired that unknown to anyone at the time, the hospital nurse who attended to Gazides was the mother of the young man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His belief in the PAC unshaken, Gazides continued his membership and went to last weekend's conference as one of the ten delegates from Umtata, and one of a handful of white delegates. But his faith was dwindling when I met him on the first day of the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He confessed to 'believing less and less' and was disillusioned because the PAC had not got its house in order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday morning, however, Gazides, who is now 60, was all smiles. After the election of Stanley Mogoba as president he said: 'I'm an extremely happy man. PAC can now only go one way and become a real electoral force in 1999.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Ben Turok is locked in dispute with fired staff, reports Mungo Soggot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFRICAN National Congress MP and economics guru Ben Turok has fired most of the staff at the NGO he runs, setting off an acrimonious labour relations wrangle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff at the Institute for African Alternatives, who were supposed to leave at the end of this month, have already been locked out of the cash-strapped NGO's Johannesburg headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turok, MP for Paarl, also told staff they could lose their retrenchment pay if they fought him through the mediation body established under the new Labour Relations Act.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Institute staff complained to the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration earlier this month that Turok had breached the new Act by not discussing the closure decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employees say they are still in the dark about Turok's plans. Shortly after the initial closure announcement, Turok suggested the institute could survive with severe cuts, and he has previously indicated the organisation should move to Paarl. He was unavailable for comment this week, despite repeated approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turok established the NGO in London in 1986 and opened offices in Johannesburg in 1991. The institute, which trains community leaders, is funded mainly by USAid, but has been struggling to raise new cash following senior staff changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent internal minutes show Turok complained he was unable to determine the NGO's financial status, nor the progress of its projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employees met Turok on November 11 to voice fears that their jobs were on the line as the NGO only had sufficient funds until next March. Staff say Turok assured them there was no immediate problem, asking one: 'Why... are you insecure about losing your job?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a week later, all but four of the NGO's employees were retrenched following a board meeting from which staff representatives were barred. Four employees were kept on to wind down the NGO's affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After staff started talking about breaches of the Act, the institute's director, Myron Peter, said they could bring in a private mediator selected by management, provided staff paid his R2500 bill. The employees replied in a memorandum: 'As all staff have been retrenched, how could you expect us to cover the costs of R2500?' They added that they would approach the commission which would act 'in the best interests of the organisation'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application to the commission ' which was faxed on December 10 ' accuses Turok of riding roughshod over the Act by 'refusing to bargain around retrenchment' and 'refusing to discuss severance pay'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following day Turok returned from a meeting with USAid in Pretoria and reportedly attacked staff for approaching the commission, tagging them 'tsotsis'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I'm not afraid of the commission,' he reportedly said. Unsigned minutes of the meeting quote him as saying: 'I will liquidate, and maybe there won't be December salaries or retrenchment packages.' He gave staff 15 minutes to decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facing the prospect of spending the festive season with no money, staff say they had to capitulate. Peter responded in a memo: 'The board welcomes the decision to waive the conciliation process and try and remain open.' Staff say they are now 'baffled'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turok ' who helped frame both the Freedom Charter and the Reconstruction and Development Programme ' recently outlined in the Mail &amp; Guardian a string of reasons behind the struggle for survival among NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These included the organisations 'having a chronic incapacity to work together ... NGOs often emerge around a particular personality, and individualism is a common feature. This tends to bring a lack of continuity as these individuals come and go.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The South African National Civics Organisation (Sanco) has parted company with Michael Levinsohn, the head of its fledgling investment arm and the brains behind its new membership drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation's stalwarts have been unnerved by Levinsohn's increasing influence over the once radical organisation, which spearheaded opposition to 'puppet' local government under apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levinsohn said there had been 'differences' with Sanco Investments Holdings (SIH) chairman Moses Mayekiso over commercial strategy. He added he had resigned mainly to pursue a buyout of listed company Venter Trailers, which failed after an acrimonious boardroom dispute.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levinsohn's departure comes two weeks after Sanco boasted at a luncheon at Johannesburg's Carlton Centre that his new membership scheme would give Sanco the biggest membership of any South African organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National President Mlungisi Hlongwane said Sanco aimed to increase its membership to 2-million within a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scheme, which Levinsohn devised with Mayekiso, involved giving members a booklet of discount vouchers for various stores in exchange for a R30 membership fee. But the plan has suffered delays. In October ' 10 months after it was announced ' the booklets had yet to printed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIH has a range of small investments its bosses say are aimed exclusively at promoting black empowerment. One of these investments is a 26% stake in Vula Communications, which plans to invest in a United States satellite phone company. It remains unclear who will succeed Levinsohn at SIH. Levinsohn said it would be more appropriate if the company were led by a black boss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levinsohn was ousted as managing director at Venter last month, after a run- in with executive chairman Michael Katcs. Levinsohn was elected managing director while Katcs recovered in a psychiatric hospital following a shoot- out at his home. The two former allies have been fighting a long-running battle over the ailing company with former owner Jasper Venter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Sanco has axed the remaining administrative staff at its Johannesburg headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanco's head of democratisation and government Mbongeni Ngubeni said its remaining two administration staff had been retrenched. Six others had quit this year. The cuts follow the decision by funder USAid to stop giving money for general administration. Apart from establishing SIH, Sanco has been struggling to find a clear focus since 1994. At last month's membership drive launch at the Carlton Centre in Johannesburg Hlongwane said one of Sanco's new projects was a scheme to use the organisation's membership as police informers to combat crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentators say the organisation has failed to develop the watchdog role it should play in post-apartheid South Africa. Mayekiso's younger brother, Sanco Alexandra president Mzwanele Mayekiso, explicitly warned in the New Nation last week against the shift to the business world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said some activists were 'degenerating into on-the-make activities ...  we run the risk of succumbing to ... corporate agendas and even their control'. To illustrate the point others have noted several top Sanco officials also have jobs in government and business. Mayekiso was in the Eastern Cape this week and unavailable for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Three former KwaZulu-Natal security policemen have applied to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) for amnesty, the commission's chief investigator said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRC investigator Satchie Govender confirmed reports that former Durban security policemen Colonel Andy Taylor and Captain Tjaart Fourie 'now with the TRC's Witness Protection Unit' and Pietermaritzburg policeman Captain Jerry Brooks, have applied for amnesty. Govender would not comment on the content of the applications.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor's application is believed to be the first by a senior police officer from the province and follows his court appearance earlier this year on charges related to the 1981 assassination of Durban human rights lawyer Griffiths Mxenge. Taylor was also subpoenaed to appear before the TRC following human rights hearings surrounding the 1978 assassination of University of Natal academic Rick Turner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor's attorney Christo Nel said Taylor's application did not relate to either of these incidents. 'He denied involvement in either of them and did not even know Turner,' said Nel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Taylor's application covered involvement in 'six or seven' other incidents including the death of askari (an insurgent-turned-collaborator) Neville 'Goodwill' Sikakhane and the 'assault during interrogation' of other people including African National Congress MP and senior South African Communist Party member Raymond Suttner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nel said Taylor had applied for amnesty in respect of 'a couple of incidents on which the TRC supplied information that he didn't even remember as they date back to 1974'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One incident included in his application involved the 'recruitment, or what you might call abduction, of a person from Swaziland who was to become an askari,' said Nel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Pietermaritzburg security policeman Brooks ' now a member of the South African Police Service Crime Intelligence Service (CIS) ' had also applied for amnesty in connection with this incident, said Nel who is also representing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Govender confirmed that TRC Witness Protection Unit member Captain Tjaart Fourie had applied for amnesty. The unit's KwaZulu-Natal head Chris McAddam, however, denied that Fourie had resigned from the unit to make his application in the wake of Taylor's application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McAddam said he could not comment on whether Fourie had applied for amnesty, but said: 'He is still a member of the unit.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Following revelations of irregularities at a Cape medical 'aid company, the Department of Health plans to fight corruption in the industry, writes Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Health is planning a crackdown on corruption in the billion-rand medical insurance industry, introducing strict new laws and policing as a priority next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources say last week's shock disclosures in the Mail &amp; Guardian of corruption and financial irregularities at the huge Cape-based medical aid company Pro Sano are only the tip of the iceberg, with other companies involved in more serious offences, yet to be exposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the disclosures about Pro Sano's financial irregularities and its loss of millions of rands has strengthened the department's hand in its plans to bring the industry to heel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources say the department has deliberately kept its plans low-key, so as not to jolt the industry's powerful players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the department was to host an open workshop on Friday to discuss the proposals and the question of Pro Sano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the experts addressing the workshop, Alex van der Heever from the influential Centre for Health Policy, said the Pro Sano case demonstrated the need for a review of current legislation and a rethink on the role of medical aid schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Given that Pro Sano is the one medical scheme that did not get away, its case demonstrates the need to have regulations to prevent things reaching the stage they did,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I think it is the government's responsibility to protect consumer rights and the intermediary has not been acting in the interests of the consumer,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Heever is also a member of the Council for Medical Schemes. He said the government lacked the capacity and legislation to deal with the industry that was driven more by profit than a desire to protect members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The industry is fragmenting and corruption here could be seen as symptomatic of the fragmentation because people can shift fragments around to their own benefit,' Van der Heever said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We can either define the relevant legislation more strictly to ensure uniform transparency, or we can deregulate and let people sort themselves out and say 'Buyer, beware', but we don't really think that that is fair for the consumer. The government has a responsibility to protect the consumer.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department was coy about the workshop earlier this week, saying it was just a public relations exercise. The department also did not wish to comment on Pro Sano, saying it was sub judice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday, the Supreme Court granted Pro Sano a stay of execution after the department's registrar of medical aid schemes applied to have the fund put into judicial management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In papers before the court, registrar Dani'l Kolver detailed a string of allegations about corruption among former Pro Sano management involving several top companies. The scheme, which provides medical benefits to thousands of public servants, has lost close to R90-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro Sano chairman Shu'ayb Patel said several of the allegations were untrue, and that he was considering suing Kolver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kolver was on leave and could not comment on his allegations, made under oath, and based on a forensic audit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The new head of the Department of Health's HIV/Aids/sexually- transmitted diseases (STD) directorate has vowed to kickstart the organisation's stumbling campaign, pursuing a strategy based on greater co- operation within the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosemary Smart, a 48-year old former nurse, was appointed to the post on December 12 ' some six months after her predecessor Quarraisha Abdool Karim resigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The directorate has been stung by criticism that it lacks leadership and drive. Morale among staff has been drained by the Sarafina II episode.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groups involved in the fight against the Aids virus have also accused the directorate of straying on to their turf, while failing to provide a clear lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview this week Smart said she planned to close the door on the mistakes of the past. 'Sarafina II has been damaging to the Aids programme, but I believe that there is sufficient goodwill to put it behind us and move forward on the important issue of tackling the epidemic,' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarafina II, she added, could have been avoided had the directorate followed the correct procedure and 'not tried to rush the 'R14,2-million project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme in 1997 will concentrate on all stakeholders developing a common understanding of the national Aids plan. This will seek to overturn the idea of an 'alleged' lack of political will behind the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Directorate figures show the number of people in South Africa infected with HIV rose to 2,2-million this year from 1,8-million in 1995. Heterosexual transmissions account for an increase of 1 000 new infections daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It would be naive to believe that the epidemic can be halted in its tracks or even appreciably slowed down in the short term,' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'There is a growing realisation that Aids is not a health issue, but has 'the potential to impact on all sectors of society. As ownership of the 'problem increases there will be 'an associated increase in support from political and other leaders.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An inter-departmental committee will meet early next year to provide a forum to create a 'united response by government to the epidemic', Smart said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the major issues the directorate will seek to tackle is that of confidentiality. Department of Health director general Olive Shisana, who oversees the directorate, has already opened the debate, arguing earlier this month that the question of confidentiality should be reviewed if the fight against the spread of the virus was to be stepped up. Her comments earned a sharp rebuke from the African National Congress and Aids activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smart said the issue was one area where policy development was needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confidentiality was also one of the key factors affecting the treatment offered to pregnant mothers who are HIV-positive. She believed that by testing in order to protect the baby, doctors may come into conflict with the mothers' right to privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administering infected mothers with the drug AZT during pregnancy and to infants immediately after birth can reduce the transmission of the virus by 70%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'However, the department recognises certain policy and ethical problems with the provision of AZT because the use of this treatment requires that pregnant women be tested for HIV,' said Smart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The efficiency of AZT when administered with a drug called 3TC is being tested at Baragwanath Hospital. 'Until conclusive results are known, making this combination available will not be considered by the department,' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smart said the Health Department was ruling out, for now, subsidising such combination treatment, given the cost of 'R70 000 to R95 000 a year per patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Future plans to subsidise treatment will be guided by research currently under way across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The results of the research will have to be interpreted and implemented within the context of the available health budget,' said Smart. 'Demands for such treatments will have to compete with other health issues.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A former commander 'of the notorious unit has 'been promoted to lead 'the SANDF, reports 'Ann Eveleth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A FORMER commander of 32 Battalion, the crack unit recently linked to train violence, is set to take over the South African National Defence Force's KwaZulu-Natal operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colonel Jan Houghardt ended his stint in South Africa's dirty wars against Angola and Namibia as second-in-command of 32 Battalion and became a group commander in the former Transvaal in the early 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently commander of the SANDF's Group 9 in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, Houghardt is set to succeed senior staff officer operations Colonel Peter Rose, who is to retire to enter the private sector at the end of the year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian disclosed earlier this month that former members of 32 Battalion have approached the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to discuss their involvement in train violence. There is no suggestion Houghardt was involved in such incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Houghardt's promotion also follows reports of a growing militarisation among SANDF-linked farm commandos in the province ' particularly in the Midlands region currently under his command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Party MP Rudi Redinger said last week some farmers had held talks with an Executive Outcomes-linked security company called Saracen, with a view to hiring them to bolster farm security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weenen farmers said they had already hired ex-Koevoet members to bolster their security following a spate of farm attacks in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence analyst Helmut Heitman said this week it was likely Houghardt would know Executive Outcomes members, 'as many of them came from 32 Battalion'. He would also have come into contact with some members of Koevoet during his stint in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major Kim van Niekerk said she did not think, however, that his prior involvement in 32 Battalion would present political problems in the volatile province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Any military person with a long record has been posted from pillar to post, so I don't think the fact he served in this or that unit should be a problem, ' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Houghardt was unavailable to comment. Heitman said he was a 'pretty hot- shot company commander with 32 Battalion in the early 1980s ... Houghardt was involved in several campaigns in the south-east and south-west of Angola, including Modular, Hooper and Packer, and was probably also involved in the last campaign in south-west Angola in 1988.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Houghardt had also served as a company commander of Operation Super in 1982, in which he led a platoon of 45 troops into an attack on Iona in south-west Angola. 'When the dust had settled, they had killed 201 insurgents and he only lost three of his guys.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of 32 Battalion members' alleged involvement in train violence are still under wraps, but Heitman said he found the disclosures 'surprising' as the battalion had 'quite a good reputation in military service'.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - While a detailed breakdown of amnesty requests is not yet available, it seems the majority have come from those already behind bars, reports Eddie Koch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although hundreds of guerrillas, policemen and some government ministers have made a late rush to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the great majority of requests for amnesty for human rights abuse have come from perpetrators who are already behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With boxes of amnesty applications still streaming into the commission's headquarters in Cape Town ' including a new one from Transport Minister Mac Maharaj ' officials say they are not yet able to provide a detailed breakdown of the types of people who applied for amnesty this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But initial indications are that up to 4000 people who think they committed human rights offences during the apartheid era have asked for indemnity from prosecution in return for confessing details of their actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By far the biggest number of these applications, possibly as many as 3000, have come from convicts whose only way out of jail is to tell all.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The trickle of applications from former security force members turned into a flood last week but appears to be slowing down since the deadline was extended,' said one 'official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No exact figures were available for the number of security force applications although by far the largest number came from members of the security police and also various murder and robbery squads of the South African Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a handful of applications had been received from military men ' even though many of the police applicants have said their abuses included joint operations with the special forces of defence force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears the small South African Defence Force (SADF) group that is co- operating with the commission comes mainly from within military intelligence.  There are no indications that anyone from the Civilian Co-operation Bureau, the main special forces unit of the SADF responsible for dirty tricks, has yet applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission officials were not able to give a breakdown of the security force officials applications by rank and are not allowed by law to make the names of applicants public. 'It seems there is a mix of ranks with lower officers applying for individual deeds while more senior officers are applying for actions that involved implementing state policy,' said one official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absence of military co-operation with the truth process stems primarily from the fact that the prosecution failed to prove that General Magnus Malan and his co-accused were responsible for the KwaMakutha massacre in KwaZulu- Natal. There have also been no other criminal cases involving military personnel to prod these people into seeking amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This could change early next year when the families of people who were murdered lodge civil proceedings against the Malan group for damages they suffered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The onus of proof in civil cases will not be as stringent and the families will be able to choose lawyers willing to mount a more combative case against the military men. This could force some of the accused to seek amnesty as this will indemnify them from liability for such claims ' and any admissions they make will have a domino effect into the military's ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian is also aware that scores of soldiers from 32 Battalion ' the 'mercenary' unit of the SADF ' are talking to the truth commission about indemnity in return for details about train attacks and other civilian terror campaigns they are reported to have committed in the early '90s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No formal amnesty applications for this group have yet been registered, but these are likely in the new year and will inevitably implicate senior military officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African National Congress has so far submitted 150 applications, mainly from members of its guerrilla wing, and has indicated it will be processing less than another 100 forms early in the new year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a public sign of commitment to the truth process, at least five ANC ministers have applied for amnesty. These are Defence Minister Joe Modise, Deputy Defence Minister Ronnie Kasrils, Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo and Transport Minister Mac Maharaj.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modise and Kasrils will be dealing with actions they participated in as senior officers in the command structure of Umkhonto weSizwe ' and will probably include orders given to attack civilian targets during the struggle against apartheid. The application from Maharaj will probably detail aspects of Operation Vula, including efforts to smuggle weapons into the country during the early 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi and Naidoo have applied for a relatively minor incident relating to the abduction of a suspected police spy at the Congress of South African Trade Unions offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only Cabinet minister from the old National Party government who has said in public that he will apply is former police minister Adrian Vlok.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Pan Africanist Congress indicated it would submit applications from the entire high command of its guerrilla wing, it handed in about 300 applications on Saturday and many of these will have to be reprocessed as they were not filled in correctly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Inkatha Freedom Party has not applied as a group although a handful of individuals have applied in their individual capacities. Moves are also afoot to provide amnesty for warlords who participated in the KwaZulu-Natal civil war in the 1980s and early 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official says there have been 'quite a lot' of applications from the ANC's self-defence units. It is expected there will be a major increase in applications from this quarter since the period in terms of which people can qualify for amnesty has been expanded to 10 May 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most self-defence unit members were involved in battles with Inkatha during the early part of 1994 before the April elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - With the first anniversary of last year's Christmas Day floods in Pietermaritzburg looming, much remains to be done to prevent a repeat of the tragedy that cost 169 lives and left nearly 6 000 families homeless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the National Disaster Relief Fund, which has already spent its R14,7- million budget for the year, will have to approach Cabinet for extra relief to cover any disasters which may strike anywhere in the country before its 1997-98 budget kicks in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local civic organisations and environmental groups say there is a mood of anger and frustration among the victims of the floods who have not been compensated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We're getting lots of complaints from people who want to know where the money has gone. They feel the money is there but it's being wasted on consultants,' Zandile Ndawonde, co-ordinator for the Greater Edendale Environmental Network (Green), told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We put together a joint action committee after the January 1995 floods to look at the problem, but the authorities weren't really interested until the December 1995 floods came and close to 200 people died. Now it is a year later and some people are still living in tents. Some babies have been born in those tents and some have learnt to walk since they moved there.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emily Zuma (21) said she has lived in a tent in Slangspruit with five family members, including her two- and five-year-old brothers since the floods washed away her home last Christmas: 'My 15-year-old sister Olga drowned in that flood. Now we are still living in a tent and we are wondering when we will get a house,' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndawonde said the local communities in the area had begun to take the environmental issues seriously after the floods and understood that settlement and overcrowding on the flood plain of the Msunduzi River could result in further deaths and also ecological degradation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he argued that the problem went beyond settlement. 'Part of the problem is that the river has been 'canalised' over the years to provide more recreational facilities for whites and to make way for the Duzi (canoe) marathon.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndawonde believes this interference in the flow of the river through the construction of canals running into Pietermaritzburg had created unnecessary flood zones by collecting large reservoirs of water in the Edendale Valley and that 'this has now resulted in black deaths'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave a'Bear, the project manager for the University of Natal's Institute of Natural Resources said growing informal settlements along the flood plain had contributed to the extent of the disaster. New land uses were being sought to avoid a repeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The rainfall was so heavy last Christmas that there would have been a flood regardless of the condition of the catchments, but the question is whether people should have died in it. This is a planning issue,' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The institute, which was commissioned by the Transitional Local Council to study solutions to the flooding problem, has now joined forces with Greens and other community leaders to find alternative land uses to prevent new informal settlements mushrooming in the disaster zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These included reforestation of the river's banks, as well as cultivation of community gardens and the construction of sport grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while victims of the river believe little has been done to prevent the disaster from recurring, it has become clear that funds to compensate them have been used up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pieter van Schalkwyk, secretary of the National Disaster Relief Fund, said this week the fund, which offers emergency relief to victims of all national disasters, had spent most its budget for the year on flood relief in KwaZulu- Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We paid out a R5-million lump sum for the Vaal Reef mining disaster earlier this year, but the remaining R9,7-million went to KwaZulu-Natal after floods in Pietermaritzburg, Weenen, Estcourt, Ladysmith, Bergville and Glencoe.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News about the fund's depletion emerged after last week's announcement that more than 5 000 families affected by the Black Christmas floods would receive no compensation for their losses. Hundreds of victims are also soon to be forced out of the emergency shelters they have occupied for the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pietermaritzburg Transitional Local Council ' which has drawn relief money for flood victims from the fund and other donations ' said no further payments would be made to 'second-priority victims' of the flood. The R189140 remaining in the city's relief coffers would only pay for three more months of tent and toilet hire for 'first-priority' victims still awaiting housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 707 families whose homes were washed away completely when the Msunduzi River overflowed its banks last December 25 had been compensated to the tune of R1293225.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'More than 600 new homes have either been built or are under construction to compensate first-priority victims who lost their homes,' said the Jeff Makhetha, the council's official in charge of the flood relief programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But unfortunately we have no money left to compensate the second-priority victims who may have lost rooms on their houses or suffered damage to carpets and other property.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The special amnesty mooted for KwaZulu-Natal may help African National Congress chairman Jacob Zuma's bid for the party's deputy presidency, but the idea is still highly controversial within ANC ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC leaders say details of the proposal to grant a special amnesty to KwaZulu-Natal's warlords has not been discussed by either the party's national executive committee or its provincial structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said the idea had not yet been discussed with President Nelson Mandela, but added: 'Zuma understands KwaZulu- Natal's problems better than anybody in the ANC, so I'm sure the president would listen to his proposal'.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other ANC leaders said a successful peace effort in KwaZulu-Natal would be the feather in Zuma's political cap and would bolster his chances of securing the ANC deputy presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said a proposal also on the table to split the party's deputy presidency from the national deputy presidency ' both of which are currently held by Thabo Mbeki ' would pave the way for Zuma to take the party's second post, but leave room for him to continue leading the province if Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi decided to return after the demise of the government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KwaZulu-Natal ANC deputy chairman S'bu Ndebele said the amnesty proposal formed part of a 'peace package' which the party's provincial conference earlier this month had resolved to offer the IFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the plan would still have to be negotiated with the IFP. The proposal under consideration would see the 'disclosure' function of the truth commission revised in the case of KwaZulu-Natal ' and probably the Gauteng townships affected by violence between the two parties ' to mean 'disclosure and dismantling of paramilitary structures and weapons', rather than disclosure of past crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFP was this week non-committal on whether it would accept such a deal as bilateral talks between the two parties still had to take place. Party secretary general Ziba Jiyane said: 'Any serious peace proposal must be supported.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A unique project has 'saved a little girl from a lifetime in hospital, reports Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evil has for once been taken out of Ondine's Curse, thanks to a determined mother and the Red Cross Children's Hospital in Cape Town. They have saved a 'cursed' toddler from life in a hospital ward. On Wednesday, Juliage Jackson was for the first time able to take her two-and-a-half-year- old daughter, Mumtaas, home to her family in the northern suburb of Blackheath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That morning, Mumtaas was up and down and all over the tracheotomy ward which had been her entire life until then. She was a little unsure about what was happening, but sensed the growing excitement of the adults around her ' the ward sisters and her mother.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I think she knows something is going to happen, I think she knows she is going home,' said Jackson, holding her proudly on her knee. 'Say how old you are, tell the lady how old you are.' Mumtaas managed a throaty gurgle which, with careful listening, translated as 'twee'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her speech is impaired by the hole cut in her throat ' a tracheotomy ' to make it possible for her to be connected to a breathing machine, or ventilator. This hole is her lifeline because her medical condition, Ondine's Curse, inhibits the functioning of her central nervous system while she sleeps. This means she cannot breathe when sleeping ' sufferers normally die shortly after birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The name Ondine means mermaid, and it was chosen to describe the rare condition after a fairytale in which a mortal was cursed by the god of the sea with loss of bodily functions for jilting a mermaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mumtaas's breathing stopped shortly after she was born at Somerset Hospital on February 2 1994. She was immediately put on to a respiratory machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'A month after her birth,' said Jackson, 'a doctor called my husband and me in and said we had to take a decision as to when we should switch off the machine, the respirator, to let her die. And I begged for a second chance, I pleaded for a second opinion, and we moved her to the Red Cross Children's Hospital, where they told us she had Ondine's Curse.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sister Jane Booth said at that time one child with Ondine's Curse was living in the tracheotomy ward at the hospital. She had suffered brain damage from lack of oxygen, and was mentally retarded. She had spent her life in ward E1, and died last year, at the age of 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I saw this girl when we brought Mumtaas in,' said Jackson. 'I said to my husband, 'Even if she lives here for the rest of her life and we have to come and visit her every day, it's better than switching off any machine.' I never thought this day would come. It's a miracle, it's like taking a newborn baby home for the first time. I was so excited last night I could not sleep and Sister Dorothy Schulman said she woke up at 4 o'clock this morning and was making notes for me.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What made Mumtaas's homecoming possible was the purchase of a ventilator which can be operated by her mother. The head of the intensive care unit at the hospital, Professor Max Klein, managed to negotiate the purchase of four ventilators at 'R28 000 each, instead of the normal price of R36 700.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was up to Jackson, a general worker in a printing works, to raise the money to buy one of these machines. She collected R6 000 from friends and relatives, she sold tickets for local musicals and then money poured in from the public after she advertised the plight of her little girl on a community radio station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She raised R20 000 in four months, and this was supplemented by the Friends of the Children's Hospital. Then she had to be trained by the ward's sisters to use the ventilator at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mumtaas has not suffered any mental retardation from the disease, and is a lively and inquisitive toddler. Booth calls her a 'busy bee', and says her speech has developed rapidly since her mother moved into the ward, to sleep in and care for her, in anticipation of her homecoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson has had to give up her job to be her child's full-time nurse.  Mumtaas must be watched all the time because she cannot be allowed to fall asleep, not even to doze, without being hooked up to the ventilator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booth said she would be visiting the family in Blackheath every two days or so in the beginning to see how they are getting on. An alarm has been connected to the ventilator so that if, by chance, the connection slips from Mumtaas's throat while she sleeps, Jackson will be woken up to reconnect it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson is planning to raise money for a generator so that her child's life is not endangered by freak power cuts in the middle of the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Nowhere in the world would somebody like Mumtaas be able to go home without full nursing care,' said Booth. 'Here we just don't have the infrastructure or the resources to provide nurses, so unless you are very wealthy, the child is doomed to stay in the hospital her whole life long. But because we have been able to train the mother, it is all possible.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mumtaas and her mother are part of a unique initiative by the Children's Hospital to pioneer a home-care programme for children with tracheotomies, to provide the children with a better quality of life and to ease the pressure on the hospital's shrinking resources. Despite a shortage of funds, the hospital has managed to return 70 children with tracheotomies ' as a result of conditions such as weak throat muscles or tumours ' to their homes, saving the hospital almost R200 000 per child each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klein said of the programme, the only one of its kind in the world: 'It's probably the most exciting thing we are doing at the hospital at the moment.  We are finding human solutions to what are usually thought of as mechanical problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We use the most sophisticated technology available anywhere in the world ' the mother.'</SPAN></P>
