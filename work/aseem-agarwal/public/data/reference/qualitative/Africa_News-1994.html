<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When parliament reconvenes in Cape Town in May next year, the majority of faces will be several shades darker than those who debated the new constitution up until last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where probably the last Afrikaner president sat to the right of the Speaker in the House of Assembly, the statesmanlike figure of Nelson Mandela will take his seat next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African National Congress leader will be accompanied by a phalanx of new faces: Thabo Mbeki in Pik Botha's seat, Cyril Ramaphosa where Hernus Kriel used to sit, Mac Maharaj in Dawie de Villiers' place...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DeVilliers will also be there, as will FW de Klerk and Roelf Meyer.  They will sit shoulder to shoulder with the Communist Party's Joe Slovo and Cosatu's ex-secretary general, Jay Naidoo. All of them will serve in a coalition cabinet in the government of national unity provided for by the transitional constitution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chances are that few of the Conservative Party MPs who got to their feet in parliament last week to sing 'Die Stem' will be returned to the country's first non-racial government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The singing of the national anthem ushered in a new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beginning in South African parliamentary politics: five years of enforced coalition government until the next elections in April 1999, during which period a new and &quot;final&quot; constitution will be written by our new rulers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For every 20 representatives elected to the new parliament, all parties will be entitled to a cabinet member. Parties will nominate their own representatives, but the allocation of portfolios will rest with the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parties with more than 80 seats will be allowed to appoint an executive vice-president to assist the president. If no party has more than 80 seats, the second biggest party will appoint a vice-president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is little doubt that Nelson Mandela, as the leader of the biggest party in the new government, will be elected president. FW de Klerk will probably lead the second biggest party, and will become one of his deputies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is certain of more than 80 representatives in government. They will therefore also be entitled to appoint a vice-president. This could be either Thabo Mbeki or Cyril Ramaphosa. The choice largely depends on whether Mbeki becomes foreign minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In political circles strong voices were raised in favour of the present minister of foreign affairs, Pik Botha, retaining his portfolio. As the longest serving foreign minister in the world, the argument goes, he has the experience and the international contacts to ensure continuity and help bring investment to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC, however, might feel that a new appointee would symbolise to the outside world the end of the apartheid era. Mbeki will then, as deputy leader and head of the ANC's department of foreign affairs, be the obvious choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another contender is Aziz Pahad, who heads the ANC's representation abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Mbeki gets the job, ANC secretary general Cyril Ramaphosa will become vice-president. If not, Ramaphosa will probably take over Roelf Meyer's portfolio of constitutional affairs. The new government will double as a constituent assembly writing the new constitution, and this portfolio is regarded as important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The position of minister of law and order will be a difficult one to fill. Political analyst Dr. Frederick van Zyl Slabbert recently suggested that his portfolio, as well as those of agriculture and defence, be allocated to rightwingers in order to ensure their participation in the democratic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is unlikely to happen, however. For the ANC it is equally important to show to its own constituency that there has been a genuine transfer of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University of Cape Town political scientist Hermann Giliomee has suggested that the law and order job had been offered to the NP's Leon Wessels, the current minister of manpower. This, he claimed, was part of the negotiations trade-offs, but it was hotly denied by the NP hierarchy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 26 November, Captain Valentine E.M. Strasser, Chairman of the National Ruling Council and Head of State of Sierra Leone, issued a statement about his government's detailed plans to return the country to constitutional rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following is the text of Captain Strasser's statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the National Provisional Ruling Council took over the reins of government on 29 April 1992, it set itself a number of priority tasks. Among these were the speedy prosecution and conclusion of the rebel war, the revamping of the economy to restore stability and achieve sustainable growth and development, and the return of Sierra Leone to a democratic constitutional rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In pursuance of these objectives, and more particularly that of ending the rebel war, the government offered an amnesty to all patriotic Sierra Leoneans who were willing to lay down their arms and participate in the reconstruction of the shattered economy, so as to restore our dignity as a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As is evident from recent reports, now that the rebel war is becoming a thing of the past, the National Provisional Ruling Council government as a further gesture of good will, and in the true spirit of reconciliation, has decided to renew the amnesty offer. In renewing this offer, the government wishes to assure all concerned that it has taken adequate steps to ensure that no one is brutalised or otherwise mistreated. All who take advantage of the amnesty offer will be humanely treated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To ensure that the information gets to all concerned, government has decided to use all possible media to disseminate the amnesty offer, including all FM stations throughout the country, the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service and other international radio stations, the print media, as well as the air drop of leaflets in the affected areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To give credence to government's commitment, it will be observed that in the wake of the recent successes by the armed forces, numerous rebels have been surrendering to them on a daily basis. All who have surrendered so far have been granted amnesty instantly and are being humanely treated by the NPRC government. To make this offer more meaningful, government has agreed to designate certain areas as neutral zones and safe corridors. It is hoped that all concerned will avail themselves of this offer and take advantage of it by using the safe corridors. The areas so designated are Buedu, Nyandehun Mambabu and Koindu in the Eastern front and Sulima and Bumpe Perri in the Southern front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government realises that this offer can only be effective in a calm and peaceful atmosphere, and has therefore decided to declare a unilateral cease-fire effective midnight, 1 December 1993, for a period of four weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, as another step in the direction of reconciliation and confidence building, the NPRC has released from detention all persons suspected to be rebels, to allow them to be reintegrated into the Sierra Leone society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Logistic support, including transport, accommodation, food, medical and related assistance, will be made available in the neutral areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fellow Sierra Leoneans, with the rehabilitation exercise already under way, my government is now afforded the opportunity of turning its attention more fully to the economic and social needs of the country with a view to enhancing the living standards of the average Sierra Leonean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let me point out that I do not intend in this statement to dwell at length on the strategy for achieving this objective. This will be the subject of another address to the nation. However, I want to give assurance to potential local and foreign investors that during the rest of this administration, we shall spare no effort in creating an enabling environment for private sector investment. We consider this of vital importance, because we realise that the resources of government are limited and cannot alone constitute the basis for a resurgence in economic activity. The enabling environment for private investment will encompass not only economic but also social and political dimensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the budget statement delivered by the secretary of state finance, in the beginning of the current fiscal year, the rudiments of an incentive framework for private sector development were outlined. We intend to build on this to ensure the creation of a competitive and fair environment for all genuine business operators. The social and political aspects of the enabling environment for all private investors will include adequate protection of not only our national borders but also the lives and properties of all those who operate in this economy. We will carry this out through effective but unobtrusive policing activities consistent with an atmosphere of peace and stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In our view, this impetus to private sector activity will constitute the basis for increased employment, higher levels of income and poverty alleviation. It is our conviction that political plurality, freedom of association and the democratic values will be devoid of meaning if the economic well-being of the populace is neglected. Indeed, a sustainable path of economic growth and improved welfare is the best basis for a peaceful transition to constitutional rule. My government will continue to strengthen the economy and the capacity of the civil service to guide its sustained recovery in the coming years. I sincerely hope and believe that the legacy of my government to future governments in Sierra Leone will be a firm foothold for economic growth after many years of previous decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fellow citizens, on the anniversary of our glorious revolution this year, my government gave a commitment on the imperative of returning the country to democratic constitutional rule. In fulfillment of this promise, we set up a National Advisory Council to work out the modalities for returning the country to a multi-party democracy, ensuring a broader and equitable participation of the citizenry in the democratic process and reflecting the views and aspirations of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, the Advisory Council has prepared a working document setting out the basis on which our new national constitution could be formulated. The process of constitution-building is never an easy one and in this instance it will require the contribution of all patriotic citizens. Our aim is to give this country a constitution that will endure the test of time and provide a framework and machinery on which individuals will conduct their affairs not only vis-a-vis each other but also between themselves and their rulers without fear or hindrance. It will also enshrine certain fundamental democratic values and principles designed to produce at all times a government of the people, by the people and for the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Determined to achieve this result, and following consultation with the Advisory Council, I am pleased to announce that the National Provisional Ruling Council is now in a position to declare a detailed transition programme that will guide my government's action in its bid to return this country to democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The transition programme entails the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. December 1993 (a): Advisory Council launches working document on the constitution to the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (b) - Establishment of an Interim National Electoral Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. February 1994: National Commission for Democracy will be set up, which, on the constitution coming into force, becomes the National Commission for Civic Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. March-June 1994: Registration of voters and delineation of constituency boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. June 1994: A draft constitution to be produced jointly by the Advisory Council and a committee of legal experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. November 1994: Non-Partisan District Council Elections to be wholly sponsored by Government: two-third members elected and one-third nominated by government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. May 1995: Referendum for adoption of constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. June 1995: (a) Constitution promulgated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The growth of the population at a rate of 3.4 per cent is creating rapid deforestation at a rate of 290 hectares a year. This in turn is affecting the life of rural women who depend on the forest for energy and land for food and cash crop production. Fuelwood is the main source of energy for domestic use in both rural and urban Gambia, but the demand for it is causing environmental degradation, which has affected the lives of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The increasing need for fuelwood is speeding the disappearance of our priceless heritage, the natural woodlands. Deforestation has accelerated unfavourable climatic conditions, which in turn resulted in the death of trees because some species cannot adapt to a shift in climate change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Drought caused by deforestation has reduced the income of our farmers, resulting in widespread poverty within some farm families. According to the UNDP office in Banjul, about 50 per cent of our population, mostly women, are living in absolute poverty. Agriculture can improve the living conditions of rural farmers only if it is combined with forest resource management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let us give nature a change; she knows her business better than we do.  Sustainable or environmentally sound agriculture involves a positive long-term trend in output (yield) and is achieved without damaging the environment and threatening the viability of the system. In the present trend in the demographic growth of The Gambia, sustainability has become one of the major objectives of agricultural research. This entails maintaining or increasing yield by using renewable resources, such as rainfall, more efficiently without degrading non- renewable resources, such as soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Planting more trees will influence rainfall and combat the threat of deforestation. Women in Jambajally in the Kombo South district have established a 2 km woodlot farm which can serve as a model for natural forest regeneration and conservation programme to combat the threat of desertification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the population grows, deforestation threatens traditional ways of life and the prospects for future generations. The Banjul Declaration of 1977, which is the government's commitment to environmental protection, warned of tragedy if the country's priceless natural heritage should be further endangered or lost. Our environment policy should be centered on comprehensive strategies such a agroforestry, gas and solar energy research, which is already in motion, household orchard development and the improvement of the human resource base (awareness and commitment) for sustainable management of the natural resources (land, water, air).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A great deal of the Gambia's wealth remains untapped as most of the productive land is not cultivated as well as it could be. Since agriculture is the mainstay of the Gambian economy, traditional farming systems, which depend most notably on rain-fed agriculture, should be improved drastically to meet the demands of the rapidly growing population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For such a transition to be successful, the Gambian concept of farming will have to be thoroughly revised. For improvement in productivity depends on developing a farming system that will increase the biological productivity of the land, rather than reduce it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the southern part of MacCarthy Island Division around Mamud Fana, fragile soil is being eroded during the rainy season at an unacceptable rate because of the topography of the land. Every year, because of the wrong method of farming, the topsoil on which the farmers depend is fast disappearing. The farmers in Mamud Fana are highly knowledgeable and experienced, but they remain powerless to halt the growing levels of erosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Replacing The Gambia's traditional farming systems with advanced, sophisticated technology will not provide an easy solution. In The Gambia, farming systems must be robust so that if agricultural chemicals do not arrive or spare parts for tractors are not available, the system does not collapse. Consequently, it is the crops, livestock and techniques with which the farmers are familiar that should be exploited to the full. The solution will involve mixing farming land and knowledge together in the right blend, for the implementation of any new farming techniques will be dependent on an educated and receptive rural farming populace. At present the main problem is lack of know-how.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agricultural problems in The Gambia can be reduced by innovative farming and innovative farmers, people who are receptive to new ideas and who can put the new ideas into effect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armed with an iron rod, Pauline Wangari, 11, menacingly demands money from a woman passer-by. Unfortunately, she is seen by the increasingly blood-thirsty Nairobi (Kenya) public who descend on her and beat her up leaving her for dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Wangari was dramatizing the life of a street girl in a concert, to her, every bit of it was the reality of her short life, as until recently, she had been living the life of a street kid since the age of six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The drama was so heart-rending that many in the audience including Wangari's mother, Rose Wanjiku, a single parent of three children, wept openly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The occasion was the official commissioning of the Peace House at Ngong on the outskirts of Nairobi by the Kenyan Minister of Culture and Social Service, Hussein Maalim.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The House is part of the major global offensive against child labour by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) through the International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC). The programme provides advisory services to all ILO member states on request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya selected as a priority case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya is among the first six countries to be selected as a priority case for action on child labour. The others are Brazil, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Peace House is not an institution but is a temporary shelter for girls whilst their immediate and long term needs are determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Kenya, there are no statistics on child labour, however, the government acknowledges its existence. The chairman of the Child Welfare Society of Kenya (CWSK) Joseph Gichuru says child labourers are part of the new phenomenon of children in difficult circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These children are forced to earn a living for themselves and/or their families as well, at the expense of valuable opportunities such as school or vocational training. Child labourers are denied not only their childhood, but most important their future as well. &quot; They are mainly found in domestic work, especially in the case of female children; in the agricultural sector, where they are involved in picking farm produce such as coffee, tea or cotton; and in the industrial sector where they are employed in factories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are also street children who earn their living through hawking, begging, drug-trafficking or in some cases through outright prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Children exposed to abuse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gichuru notes that all these children are exposed to all forms of abuse, notably child battering, sexual abuse and child defilement as well as exploitation. &quot; The overall effect of the working conditions of children is therefore the dehumanization of the child and subsequent creation of a social deviant with a grudge against humanity and the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gichuru calls for the development of an action-oriented national policy on child labour. He suggests that such a policy should address itself to improving the environment within which the child lives by empowering the family to be self-reliant, if only in subsistence so that the working child is free to continue with education. Working hours should be reduced so that the child does not have to forgo the attainment of his basic childhood rights such as education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Where work for the child is inevitable, attempts should be made to improve the health and nutritional status,&quot; says Gichuru. His organisation has chosen to tackle one aspect of child labour, namely the child who works on the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About two decades ago, one could spot two or three boys in various corners of Nairobi streets who were conveniently baptized &quot;parking boys.&quot; They directed vehicles to empty parking slots for a few coins and offered to look after the cars during the owners' absence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1980's saw girls joining boys on the streets, a problem which caught the nation unawares. The deteriorating economic situation of the 1990's has led many children to turn the streets into homes in all urban areas. In Nairobi, they are called &quot;street children&quot;; in Mombasa &quot;beach boys&quot;; in Kisumu &quot;basket boys&quot;; in Nakuru &quot;dust bins boys&quot;; and in other smaller towns, they are &quot;market boys&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the ever-increasing problem of street kids, there are no reliable figures on these children. The last survey done in 1984 indicated that these children totalled about 30,000. The CWSK Project Officer on Street Children, Ms. Elizabeth Kamau, admitted that the lack of statistics was a major drawback &quot;...and we have commissioned a private agency to do a national baseline survey on street children. We hope to have the results by the middle of next year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the problem of street children started with boys well-articulated programmes to rehabilitate them have been in existence for a long time. For instance, the Undugu Society (Undugu means brotherhood in Swahili) was until recently concerned with street boys only in Nairobi. This Kenyan Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) was established 20 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the gender aspect of the problem, Kamau said street girls were vulnerable and suffered much more than boys through &quot;unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases including AIDS and are more open to all sorts of abuse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Survey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As part of investigations to determine the needs of street children, five social workers undertook a survey of Nairobi to try and develop a relationship of trust with street girls in order to establish what sort of intervention was needed in each case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wangari was among the first to be interviewed. It was not difficult to talk to her as she confessed: &quot;I have always wanted to get out. I was tired of begging, my mother always made me go out with the baby on my back. And then, there were street fights with rival gangs over earnings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The social workers had to determine why the child went out into the streets and in the case of Wangari, it was abject poverty. Her mother did not have a job and could therefore not afford to rent a house for the family.  They were always on the move with very little to ear. The mother had to serve a three-month jail sentence twice for brewing illicit alcohol, 'changa', leaving the children to fend for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wangari's home was not conducive to proper rehabilitation, and she was referred to the Peace House. Her mother was asked what she could do and she narrated how she used to work as a vegetable vendor without a licence and that one day her goods were confiscated by the city authorities, after which she lost all her capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A loan has been made available to Wangari's mother, Wanjiku, to enable her to sell vegetables. This time she has a licence and has moved to Ngong where she rents a house for her family. Wangari is now a school girl. The project limits itself to children between six and fourteen years. Once they are identified, their homes are explored and those found in want like Wangari, are sent to the Peace House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The school-age children who are interested in continuing with formal education are sponsored to do so while older children were allowed to choose their priorities and then taken to identified skilled artisans for vocational training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Peace House can accommodate up to 20 children but as many as 100 have been squeezed in for a night with the time limit of three months. The scheme has accommodated a total of 102 girls in various stages of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Child Welfare Society of Kenya has observed that this was a &quot;drop in the ocean but that a good start has been made.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Slave House on Goree Island is a 30-minute ferry ride from the modern, thriving city of Dakar (Senegal). But when one steps onto the island and through the heavy wooden door of the Maison des Esclaves, one enters another, darker time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tragic history of the slave trade is not complete without a study of the role this little piece of land played in sending so many Africans to a lifetime of servitude, if not their death. One man who has devoted his life to preserving the memories of the slaves is Joseph Ndiaye, archivist of the Slave House. In an interview with Mr. Ndiaye last Saturday on the island, he made a passionate appeal to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to help rehabilitate the ageing Slave House, which was renovated by UNESCO, but is in need of repairs. Mr. Ndiaye is a walking encyclopedia of facts and figures on the slave trade and the key role Goree Island played between 1536 and 1848, first in promoting the trade and eventually in preventing it, when the island became a base for ships policing the waters against slave boats. The Portuguese were the first merchants to create a settlement there between 1536 and 1580, followed by the Dutch. Slaves were brought from various parts of Africa to Goree where they were sold to traders and kept in appalling conditions in the basements of the merchants' grand houses to await shipment abroad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goree was ideally situated as a staging post for America and the West Indies, where the majority of the slaves were sent to work on the cotton, coffee and sugar plantations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Slave House that has been preserved today is just one of the many similar houses used to store humans as trade goods. On the first floor are large, airy rooms with tall windows and an open balcony overlooking the Atlantic. The wealthy slave trader and his family lived here, while down below in dark, unventilated and cramped chambers the recently captured slaves awaited an unknown fate across the seas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Ndiaye is adept at bringing to life the horror of these conditions. One of the cells measures 2.6 metres in width. In this were kept 15 slaves. Around their waist they each wore a 10.3 kg metal weight linked to their ankle with a heavy lock to prevent escape. Anyone who tried to escape was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The weighing room was a vital part of the Slave House. The minimum weight required for adult slaves was 60 kg and in this room the slaves were weighed to see if they matched up to the requirements. People from Nigeria and Niger were the most in demand as they were generally the strongest and heaviest. The slaves were transported in the hold of the ship, in a space usually no more than 30 metres long and 8 metres wide. At least 350 slaves were packed into this space -- the more slaves the ship could cram in, the more profit the traders could make. But the average mortality rate during the journey across the Atlantic was between 25 and 30 percent, and the bodies of the dead and the dying slaves were thrown overboard into the sea. During the 300 years of this inhuman trade, between 15 and 20 million Africans were sold and sent abroad as slaves, and it is estimated that six million died before they ever reached their final destination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many famous international figures have stood on the steps of the Slave House and listened to Joseph Ndiaye's eloquent and moving account of the world's most despicable trade, including Pope John Paul II, Nelson Mandela and President Mitterand of France. But will the OAU hear his call to help preserve one of Africa's greatest relics?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> January 14, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consumers in francophone West Africa suffered their worst economic jolt in nearly 50 years this week when stores doubled their prices following a major regional currency devaluation that amounted to another break in the long standing, close relationship with their former colonial ruler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measure, taken by the 11 countries of the Central African Franc (CFA) zone on January 11, was designed to increase domestic production and investment. Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan told reporters that the measure was aimed at creating &quot;a future with better days, especially for our youth,&quot; adding that it would allow Ivory Coast to &quot;rediscover the economic growth that had given it pride in the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, for the time being people in many francophone countries are only seeing skyrocketing prices, primarily on imports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At one Abidjan supermarket, the price of a liter of French-made vanilla ice-cream soared to about $20. In a panic-buying spree consumers cleared store shelves of imported goods, keeping one step ahead of the price changers. Prices on most locally produced products remained the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That same supermarket, Nour-al-Hyat, was closed by the government on January 11 because it allegedly ignored price controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exchange rate now is fixed at 100 CFA to 1 French franc, down from 50 to 1., but it will be some time before that stabilizes and people begin to see the promised benefits of devaluation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It will put off our coming into the CFA franc zone,: said Thomas Perko. regional representative for General Motors, which already has functioning outlets in anglophone Nigeria and Ghana, which have floating currencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike most of their neighbors, CFA countries never had to worry about the fluctuation of their currency, which has had parity with the French franc for 45 years to promote stability and foster economic ties between France and its former colonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The French currency role in those countries -- Senegal, Equatorial Guinea, Central Africa Republic, Togo, Ivory Coast, Benin, Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Gabon, Congo and Comoros -- has been a major tool for French political influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had long pressured franc zone nations to devalue because it considered the CFA overvalued. The high rate of exchange made informal cross-border trade popular with countries with floating currencies; it also prompted capital flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> France was urged by the IMF to support devaluation to help its former colonies recover from a decade-long economic slump largely brought on by a drop in commodities prices. France eventually conditioned additional development aid on economic reform and encouraged increased cooperation between its former colonies and the IMF. But France hasn't entirely cut its paternalistic ties. Paris announced post-devaluation bilateral debt relief for CFA countries of $4.2 billion. The IMF also says it will invest at least $1.5 billion to help ease the pain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Importers and consumers dependent on foreign products most immediately will suffer the effects of devaluation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lebanese business Ali Hammoud said he lost thousands of dollars in less than 24 hours because he failed to convert his CFA before devaluation.  &quot;I never, never thought the CFA was going down,&quot; he said. &quot;I have nothing left in my shop. What do I do? Go to Lebanon? I don't know Lebanon. I have two children to feed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The average person who eats locally-produced food should not be adversely affected by the devaluation unless the price of fuel increases., which is likely. That will force people who bring produce into the city from the interior to raise their prices to cover transportation costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burkina Faso, Mail, Chad and Niger, four of the world's poorest countries, could suffer more because the desert nations do not have sufficient agricultural and industrial capacity to offset a drop in imports or price hikes on those products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some franc zone countries have already taken their own measures to soften the blow of devaluation. Senegal announced a 10 percent pay hike for civil servants; last summer it lowered salaries by 15 percent as part of a structural adjustment program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ivory Coast and other nations have announced price controls. Duncan, the prime minister, increased the price of rice by 10 percent and gas by 15 percent. He also said civil servants would receive salary increases of between five and 15 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The devaluation comes a month after the death of Africa's longest serving president, Felix Houphouet- Boigny of Ivory Coast, who helped lead the region to independence but had always urged maintaining close ties with France. The late president's funeral is to take place on February 7 in Yamasoukro, his birth place, which is the formal political capital of the country he ruled for three decades.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFRICA RECOVERY, January 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Donors should ease their stringent conditions on aid to Africa, UN officials argue, in order to counter the communication of mounting economic and political turmoil and falling financial inflows now threatening to plunge the continent into further decline. Urging donors to show &quot;greater understanding&quot; of the difficult situation in which African governments find themselves and their limited room for maneuver, Mr. Layashi Yaker, Executive Secretary of the UN's Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) also said that the ability of African states to carry out their economic responsibilities must be enhanced. &quot;The state must be strengthened,&quot; Mr. Yaker said, reflecting the growing feeling that market- dominated strategies must not negate the role of the public sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Yaker also called for &quot;bold new measures&quot; to lower the debt burden which continues to frustrate the continent's recovery efforts. He was presenting his annual review of African economies in a speech to diplomats in Addis Ababa last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far during the 1990s, African economies have grown by a mere 1.5 per cent a year -- worse than during the &quot;lost decade&quot; of the 1980s.  Prospects for this year are only a little improved. ECA estimates that, at best, African economies will grow by only 2.5 per cent this year, still well below the level of population increase. &quot;The prevailing economic and political conditions in Africa do not allow for much optimism,&quot; Mr. Yaker warned.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just when increased help is needed, flows of official development assistance (ODA) to Africa have fallen a staggering 30 per cent in 1992, the ECA says. Yet, there is at the same time the paradoxical growth of undisbursed funds to the continent, averaging over $57 bn a year since 1990.  This compares with actual disbursement of funds to Africa of some $21 bn a year, for the same period, leading Mr. Yaker to call for &quot;greater flexibility&quot; in setting aid conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Edward Jaycox, the World Bank's Vice President for Africa, has already pointed out that undisbursed funds from the Bank to Africa were -- at over $16 bn -- equivalent to the entire three-year replenishment of the continent's single most important source of concessional money, the International Development Association (IDA). Nearly half-way through its 10-year life, the European Union's fourth Lome Convention with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries has disbursed only 13 per cent of its funds.  Millions of dollars still wait to be disbursed from earlier Lome aid budgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unutilized Funding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These unutilized pools of funding, Mr. Yaker concedes, largely reflect Africa's declining absorptive capacity, the result of &quot;political restlessness and paralysis accompanying the democratization process,&quot; as well as &quot;outright&quot; armed conflicts, and weak administrative structures. But donors are deepening Africa's financial drought with conditions on aid precisely at the time when government are finding it more and more difficult, politically and financially, to implement the tough measures demanded in their adjustment programmes. &quot;New conditionalities&quot; on aid have been an important factor in the underfunding of most reform programmes, Mr. Yaker agrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in a 2 December address to the Panel of High-Level Personalities he has set up to advise him on implementation of the UN's New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, argued that &quot;greater care&quot; must be taken to help governments address &quot;the dire human consequences&quot; of economic reform programmes, observing that &quot;structural adjustment is not popular on the streets of Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his end of year survey of the African economy, Mr. Yaker said that the number of countries where political crises were impeding economic reforms was increasing. &quot;Paradoxically, many such political crises were linked to the efforts at the democratization process,&quot; he observed. In this context, the combination of poor economic performance, tough conditionality and inadequate aid funding has often proved a combustible mix. &quot;Given that the continent was already burdened with stringent austerity measures and growing social unease, further doses of economic retrenchments could only have proved, as they did in 1992, politically and socially burdensome,&quot; Mr. Yaker argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For every example of recovery from conflict, such as Ethiopia, where the economy grew an estimated 9.3 per cent, there were others such as Zaire where the economy continued to contract, last year by some 4 per cent after a 12 per cent decline in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Drought continued to frustrate African reform efforts as well.  Agricultural production was well down in Morocco and other North African countries, with the sub- region barely growing at 0.1 per cent in 1993.  Eastern and Southern African countries were also slow to recover from the impact of 1992's severe drought, growing some 1.5 per cent last year. The ECA also warns that recent crop failures in Eritrea and Ethiopia could be a &quot;harbinger of another round of famine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adding to these internal problems was the continued sluggishness in the world economy generally. Poor demand in industrialized countries led to an estimated 6.4 per cent fall in prices for Africa's non-oil commodity exports, and could postpone hopes for the current year of a reversal in the 20-year downward spiral that has wreaked so much havoc on the continent's economies. With oil prices also well down, African export earnings declined an estimated 2.7 per cent in 1993, to $72bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade talks in December brings little hope for the immediate future. African food importers can expect higher prices, Mr. Yaker warns, while Lome Convention members face the erosion of their preferential access to the vital European market. With Africa's level of domestic investment continuing to stagnate, the continent will remain crucially dependent on high inflows of concessional funding to fuel its economic recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aid flows, however, not only have to be larger, but better coordinated and focused as well, Mr. Yaker argues. Aid should be increasingly directed towards building Africa's indigenous capacity to manage its own economic direction. While the essential role of the state is as facilitator and coordinator, recent development strategies have gone too far in dismantling the public sector, Mr. Yaker implies. &quot;Countries have responded to the well-known failures of old approaches by abandoning planning altogether,&quot; Mr.  Yaker observes. Instead, strategic planning involving all the principal economic actors, should replace the old model of central planning, be argues.  With similar arguments confronting market- driven efforts at reform in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, ECA will try to promote this new thinking further at its May Council of Ministers meeting in Addis Ababa.  Goals will include the development of strategic national planning exercises, involving closer partnerships between the major institutional players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the state must be enabled to play a strengthened strategic role, African governments will also have to show &quot;greater sensitivity&quot; to the need for public support for reform measures, Mr. Yaker said. Endorsing African countries taking over the &quot;ownership&quot; of reform programmes, Mr. Yaker stressed their related need to boost the competence of their economic governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lack of Domestic Investment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already, lack of domestic investor confidence in economic management is inflicting the &quot;dual damage&quot; of restraining local capital formation and sending unfavourable signals to foreign investors, Mr. Yaker argued. This is compounded by Africa's debt burden, which continues to weigh heavily on the continent's economic prospects while official creditors discuss further relief. &quot;Unless bold, new measures are taken in 1994 to reduce the debt stock and debt servicing requirements of African countries, economic growth will again be limited as more of ht a meager resources available are devoted to debt repayments,&quot; Mr. Yaker said. Actual debt servicing jumped to 35 per cent of exports in 1992 from 30 per cent in 1991. Debt reduction on a scale larger than the Trinidad terms -- which offer cancellation of two-thirds of eligible debt, but which have yet to be fully implemented -- is now required if investor confidence in African economies is to be boosted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, January 7-January 11, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's newspaper industry has become VERY competitive, and some have suffered the worst pinch of the current economic squeeze, and some papers have died or have one foot in the grave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a variety of newspapers on the news-stands today and that is one of the reasons the going is tough. Papers are dying as fast as they are born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Star's Last Breath</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the influential dailies like The Star which had maintained a steady competition as the only privately-owned English daily recently closed.  This left the government owned New Vision with a monopoly over the daily English market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Star which used to be published by the Shield Publications Ltd.  tried to go weekly on September 1, in an effort to stop its financial bleeding. General Manager Katende Luutu justified the move as a means of reducing the high costs of maintaining the two dailies, The Star in English and Ngabo in Luganda. Staff was cut from 74 to 54. Two months later The Star wound up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even Uganda Eyogera a Luganda daily founded mid- last year had its Editor-in-Chief Eng. J.B. Walusimbi suspended last month on allegations of &quot;mismanagement and financial problems.&quot; The paper's financial woes are said to have led to its &quot;temporary closure&quot; on December 6, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The closure allegedly came after workers deserted their duties after prolonged non-payment of their salaries. Uganda Eyogera had been running on a daily basis since March 1993. Walusimbi's suspension say Robert Kiwanuka who had been editor &quot;eating&quot; chief editorship on the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just to make the paper's problems worse, thieves on December 22 are said to have broken into the offices and taken off with two typewriters and destroyed a radio cassette.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other papers like the New Mirror, Express Post, News Magazine, Financial Times, The Banner, The News Desk and Mukwano which were born amidst lively competition, have either closed down forever, or indefinitely like the case with The Times. The Banner, the then only broadsheet on the market when it was founded in 1992, survived only two issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The New Vision's monopoly power over the daily English market is now facing a new entrant. Weekly Topic put out a Daily Topic beginning January 3, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In July of 1992 there was a dramatic change of faces at Weekly Topic when all but one of its senior journalists left the paper to found their own, The Monitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one of the more remarkable footnotes of recent media history in Uganda, The Monitor became the largest circulating newspaper in less than a year, and became a bi-weekly in March last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cheeye's Hand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision by Sseezi Cheeye's Uganda Confidential to rapidly from being a monthly, to a bi-monthly and a weekly changed the face of the weekly market. Its irreverent and crusading style put pressure on other weeklies to change. Weekly Topic's decision to go daily was seen partly as a response to that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New Vision's reach in the market already eaten into by The Monitor may have to respond to the more blunt and aggressive reporting that one senses Daily Topic is bringing to that segment of the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The New Vision's unchallenged four-year reign as the highest circulating newspaper stumbled on Mondays when Uganda Confidential comes out, Tuesday when The Monitor hits the market and on Fridays when Weekly Topic (before it went daily) and the Monitor compete for the same audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting Back</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To counter the competition, New Vision decided to come up with pullouts like the 'Vision Weekend' on Fridays and 'Straight Talk' on Tuesdays to compete with The Monitor and Weekly Topic. The Vision Weekend was too much like the Weekly Topic's new Weekend Outlook section, many analysts could not help see it is a counter- offensive. New Vision cashing on the fact that it has the best printed pages and gets a lot of the official adverting has increased the number of its pages, and is doing brisk business in advertising which is the envy of every editor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Going Modern</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As part of the shake ups in the industry, most of the surviving newspapers in the country have embarked on a restructuring exercise to modernise their production mechanism and gain efficiency. Computers are edging out the old fashioned and labour intensive manual typewriters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cost reduction moves have seen publications laying off some of their staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last October, the youthful Weekly Topic Editor John Baptist Wasswa sent five of its senior journalists on a forced leave in a restructuring move that began November 1.  Though this was never said publicly, the move was seen as aimed at some &quot;old guards&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources within the paper said at least one person in this group had passed his retirement age and most of them were largely non performers. The measure was reportedly to pave way for the young graduate journalists fresh from the University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The affected staff, like the assistant Editor Henry Baguma (who has since been recalled) John J. Lule, Willy Kironde Mukasa and Emmanuel Okullu Opk were some of the longest serving staffers at the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Munno Publications also recently sent all its workers on indefinite forced leave. Eight of their senior</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">staff, including three editors: Lawrence Kateregga, Henry Lumansi and Tamale Mirundi, were sacked. Reason? The cost of maintaining the publication was too high and a restructuring exercise was inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Munno's Woes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Munno Publications are the publishers of the oldest vernacular newspaper in the country and among the oldest surviving newspapers in Africa.  The paper was started in 1911 by Catholic missionaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paper's financial woes started eight years ago but became very bad three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Munno's woes distressed many senior journalists. At one time about 10 years ago, it was considered the &quot;most reliable&quot; newspaper in the country, and had very high circulations. But Munno was successful in the past because it relied on a network of priests to get its information from places where no one else would, and was broadly mindful of Catholic interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recent years have seen it ignoring the interests of sections of the &quot;Catholic interest&quot; in parts of the country, and increasingly pushing the line for the radical faction of the Democratic Party, with which its Editor-in-Chief, Anthony Ssekwayama, is believed to be allied. It was courting disaster, and the further it has drifted from the safe center, the more it has sank into a grave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The result of the Munno fiasco is that Tamale Mirundi, who was their best reporter, has teamed up with John Kakande, who was deputy editor of The Star, to bring out Lipoota Reporter with a Ligunda and English editions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They will have to contend with Saba Saba, which was born last year and is now the highest circulating Luganda newspaper, and the Luganda version of Uganda Confidential, which is likely in the long run to change the tastes of the Luganda readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cutting Losses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another paper which is being closely watched is The Monitor. The July 14, 1993 government ban on its departments and parastatals advertising in the Monitor had also created a siege mentality in the newspaper, and on some days its offices look like a war room. While it has been perhaps the only newspaper to expand its circulation significantly since the ban in a bid to stem the drop in advertising revenues, its proprietors have nevertheless put a full stop on staff expansion and relapsed into fiscal conservatism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paper, unlike in its first year, has not recruited new staff since the advert ban. There is talk of a number of their staff who are currently teaching in the Mass Communications programme at Makerere University withdrawing from that service to go into the &quot;trenches,&quot; as the expression at the paper goes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The programme, which started five years ago, was the brain child of the late Dr. Francis Kidubukka (May his soul rest in eternal peace), Charles Onyango-Obbo, Editor of The Monitor, among others, and was run almost as a one-man show in 1992 by Mr. David Ouma the News Editor of The Monitor when Onyango-Obbo went off on study to the Harvard University, USA, and the programme did not have a Fulbright Fellow which now, fortunately, it has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Monitor has always been successful partly because it was able to put a new look in the paper by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">coming up regularly with new features: District News, Regional Report, the currently much-read District Profile and the irreverent teaser--Snakes and Ladder of the CA Vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next week it will start publishing a children's paper, Children's Voice, derived from its very successful child-participatory &quot;Children's Voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in this they do not have a monopoly. The Daily Topic, from how it has gone in the first week of being a daily, has a new feature for every day.  All these innovations must be breaking for journalists. Only one group of people must be happy, the readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Watch-dogs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides money, the press has to contend with the politicians' rope around their necks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cases of criminal libel, and the highly political sedition cases, are not getting fewer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the courts have tended to lean on the side of the press, when court awarded former Amin minister Wanume Kibedi Shs.4.5 million in January, in a defamation case he brought against The Citizen newspaper, it was almost left on its knees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Individual journalists are also still being threatened and intimidated with arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest being the recent arrest of Uganda Confidential's editor, Teddy Sseezi-Cheeye, and Hussein Njuki and Haruna Kanabi, respectively editor and sub- editor of The Shariat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were arrested and held for four days, before being charged with sedition and publishing false news, and released at various dates on bail.  For Seezi-Cheeye it was his fourth trip to jail in as many years. Even with the very best effort, Uganda Confidential reportedly cannot keep up with the criminal and civil cases being brought against it, but it remains undeterred--and very profitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New Faces</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the rat race and the risks, one would think new entrants would be faint-hearted.  No.  More and more papers are still being born. Apart from the papers like Lipoota, and the ever-growing New Vision family which recently added on th Luo paper Rupiny, and the Sunday Vision last year, other papers are still in the offing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Wednesday January 5, 1994, a new paper called The Statesman was born. A Swahili paper will soon hit the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda Today, a new paper, also came on the streets about four weeks ago. By the end of the month, an East African edition of the Nairobi-published will come on the news-stands. They have been advertising heavily in local papers for Ugandan journalists to run their Kampala operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many good and senior journalists, frustrated or bored with their present jobs, are known to have applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are about 25 publications in the country today, with 18 weeklies, six dailies and one bi-weekly. by mid-year, it will be interesting to see whether there will be more or less.  No one can tell for sure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH, January 24, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The economy which this administration inherited was one characterised by grave debilities and great instabilities. On virtually all the indices, the outlook was rather sobering. Economic output as measured by gross national product has been on a steady decline in the past few years. Owing to the sluggish growth, employment has stagnated while the phenomenal growth in money supply fuelled by expansionary fiscal policies have piled pressure on the real sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interbank and lending rates have risen to unprecedented levels, resulting in declines in investment and production. All these have been worsened by a collapse in the value of the naira, the attendant rapid increase of service charges on external debts and the worsening balance of payment profile.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In short, it can be said that inadequate fiscal discipline complicated the already high incidence of budget deficits which, in turn, made efforts at economic reform more difficult to handle and led to a worsening of social conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The federal budget of 1993 was formulated to address and redress the decline in economic activities. One of its advertised objectives was to promote accountability and transparency in the management of public finance.  The budget also aimed at enhancing public sector activities and social programmes, while eliminating market distortions by giving freer rein to private enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For reasons which are not too difficult to discern, the 1993 budget performed rather poorly both in terms of attainment of set objectives and fidelity to the overall strategy. The budget deficit soared to N90 billion and this resulted in an excessive growth in money supply. The economy experienced high inflation, depreciation of the naira an continuing low capacity utilisation in the real sector. The political crisis which took up most of the second half of the year only served to further accentuate these already serious problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three-year rolling plan was introduced to replace the five-year medium term programme as a development strategy. The twin-objectives of the 1994- 1996 rolling plan are to institute correct macro-economic policies and instill fiscal discipline in order to fashion a more conducive environment for economic growth. It is this imperative that provides the context for the 1994 federal budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The goals of the 1994 budget have been set to reverse the negative trend of the recent past. These</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goals are: balanced budget firmly anchored in fiscal discipline and abolition of deficit financing; identification and mobilisation of new sources of collectible revenue; exchange rate stabilisation and reversal of the high incidence of capital flight; rationalisation of interest rates to stem the decline of the real sector; adoption of a comprehensive budgeting approach to bring all projects into the process; reduction in the level of subsidies and subventions to federal government-owned companies and parastatals, particularly those slated for partial or full commercialisation and outright privatisation; effective debt management strategies to reduce the debt service burdens on domestic commitments and obtain debt relief from the external creditors; rehabilitation of socio- economic infrastructure and strengthening of the law and order apparatus to provide a conducive environment for legitimate economic pursuits and private initiative; increase in the capacity utilisation of the industrial sector and effective sourcing of local raw materials; promotion of growth linkages in the rural economy; promotion of employment opportunities to reduce the currently high level of unemployment, especially among the youths; and policy fidelity and close monitoring of implementation to ensure the of these goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These goals, singularly and in concert, define an economic framework for budget plans and are, therefore, measures for ensuring overall discipline in our recovery effort. This administration will use these goals as standards for measuring the performance of sectors, institutions and officials. This administration wishes to serve notice that the monitoring and review of strategic institutions of public policy which we have commenced will continue and be intensified. This administration will neither tolerate the subversion of its programmes and policies nor will it allow its articulated goals and guidelines to be casually discarded or treated as mere suggestions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are now more aware of the relationship between the various aspects of reform programmes we have sought to implement and their overall effects on the quality of life of our citizens. We know that if we service debts, whose total legal character is yet to be ascertained, with our 30 kobo of every externally accrued naira, and if the percentage devoted to servicing of our debts continue to increase while the total income continue to decrease, that out people's welfare would also continue to be mortgaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We know that it we embarked on economic reform projects that tie the hands of government and disables government from putting in place programmes that will shelter the more vulnerable sectors of our society from the negative effects of these reforms, that we are actively increasing the ranks of the disaffected who will demand either protection from these effects of call for a change of the economic order and of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We know that we cannot embark on a ruinous debt service regime, mount an economic reform programme, and initiated difficult changes of our political system all at the same time. While investors' capital seek new arenas opened up by the ending of the cold war, it is apparent that the Nigerian managers of our economy would have to organise novel ways of undertaking reforms without increasing the volume of conflicts within our social order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international community must also come to understand the implications of these various programmes that have shaped the condition of life of our citizens. It is no longer enough to insist on reforms whose patterns of effects have now been catalogues country after country and yet for the international community not to appreciate what are the likely outcomes of changes that it advocates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria, like other African countries similarly situated, have implemented structural adjustments of their economies. They are carrying the heavy burden that their debts place on their shoulders and they are saddled with the effect of painful and conflict-ridden democratisation of the policies. These three projects are all sources of conflicts that threaten social order and peace. There must be a way of spacing them and managing the conflicts they generate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, January 7-January 11, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea sounded very attractive to the other leaders apparently because of the commonality of political problems facing the three leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tanzania's Ali Hassan Mwinyi is threatened with cracks in the union between mainland Tanzania and the Zanzibar island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya has been in the throes of ethnic violence for about a year now, and Moi, according to analysts in Nairobi sees part of the solution in an army under control, and a middle class which returns to its old relatively high standard of living.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Museveni was in Nairobi to attend the 30th Independence anniversary, Mwinyi was also in attendance and the three leaders reportedly met again and continued their Arusha conversations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The push for a revival of the East African Community from Kenya's Moi has been remarkable since they initialed the November treaty in Arusha which started the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday a meeting of the Tripartite Commission which set up the treaty got underway and will go through the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The confederate authority would as a matter of priority put in place a joint military structure which sources say would be a design to crush any coup attempts by any of the national armies in the three states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides the political benefits, Kenya has a lot more economic benefits to gain in the renewed regional cooperation. First because its previous position as an economic giant has suffered a severe blow from economic decline. Most investors in Kenya now view Uganda and Tanzania as more promising grounds for their money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, the lifting of economic and political sanctions against South Africa has created economic panic among the Kenyan business class.  South African goods have already started replacing Kenyan goods in both Uganda and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's interest in a joint airframe under the regional structure is understandable, if only because it lacks an airframe to speak of since its fleet was wiped out by the in the 1979 liberation war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the last seven years, Sudanese planes have impudently invaded Uganda's airspace and indiscriminately bombed areas near the border. The Sudanese government says rebels of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) have bases in northern Uganda, a claim the Kampala government has consistently denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amidst all the euphoria however, The Monitor has learnt that Museveni remains th puzzling quantity in this scenario.  First, he allegedly dominates meetings of the three heads of state by the sheer force of his intellect and plain speaking. Not many people believe that Uganda wants only safe passage to the sea and a cheap way to have an airframe capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unease about Museveni is not entirely unfounded. The Monitor's sub-editor was in Nairobi recently to sound out the new mood in Kenya in favour of regional co-operation and the comfortable relationship between Museveni and Moi, once arch enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He reported that the level of public admiration for Museveni was tremendous. Museveni made bones when he kept a large crowd on its toes with his kick-them-in-the-pants speech during the December celebrations in Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we were to elect an East African president, we would elect Museveni,&quot; he reported several Kenyans telling him (see story next week).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the Arusha meeting which put emphasis on expanding functional instituitions like railways, harbours, posts and telecommunications, Kenya has already extended its railway services up to Kampala, adding to the fleet of buses that now ply between the two capital cities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. COMMITTEE FOR REFUGEES ISSUE PAPER, December 1993</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This report was written by Jeff Drumtra, Africa policy analyst for the U.S. Committee for Refugees (USCR). It is based, in part, on a USCR site visit to Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and South Africa in April/May 1993. It was edited by Virginia Hamilton and produced by Koula Papanicolas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following are conclusions and recommendations derived from this study. Conclusions and Recommendations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique is undergoing a transformation of historic proportions. One of the world's most brutal wars is over. The largest return of refugees and internally displaced persons in African history is taking place in the poorest country on earth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 5.5 million returnees will discover all too soon, however, that their beloved homeland is not yet ready to be a decent home. Too many devastating years of war, drought, and abandonment have brought the nation to its knees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the fighting has stopped, permanent peace has not quite begun. Mozambique will not truly find peace until its uprooted people find their way home. The country cannot expect to piece itself back together until all its pieces--its people--are home again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For millions of Mozambicans, most of them illiterate farmers who had no stake in the civil war other than bare survival, resettlement in their home districts involves dangerous risks--risks that war could resume, that political instability might drag on interminably, that food will be scarce and landmines abundant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambicans going home after years of upheaval deserve tranquillity and security, but they will instead find dangerous new tests awaiting them.  Returnees will need help from many quarters if they are to integrate successfully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The test for Mozambican government officials is whether they are equal to the task of rebuilding their country with political openness, economic reforms, and wise development decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The test for Renamo is whether it is willing to lay down its arms and join the national political discourse with civil ideas instead of brutality and guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The test for neighboring countries of asylum is whether they will support repatriation with patience so that Mozambique can acquire permanent stability that would benefit the entire southern African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the United States and the international community, the test is whether they will provide sufficient, well-targeted assistance in an age of shrinking budgets and competing international priorities to help tormented people rebuild their lives and their nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Massive repatriation and resettlement are underway in Mozambique, ready or not. This is a pivotal moment that could produce a new humanitarian crisis, or form the basis for a shattered nation's fresh beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With these challenges in mind, the U.S. Committee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for Refugees makes the following recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To the Mozambican Government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Improve the government's cooperation with relief and development agencies. Specifically, the government should reduce import duties on relief supplies and equipment, encourage international NGOs in Malawi to establish cross-border operations in to Mozambique, and crack down on corruption by government workers engaged in relief distributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Top government officials have given repeated assurances that government policy includes full cooperation with relief and repatriation operations, but government personnel often fall short of those promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government should expedite the import of NGO and UN supplies without exorbitant tariffs. Government officials should streamline procedures so that NGOs with long experience working in Malawi refugee camps can easily transfer their programs across the border into Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambican officials should ferret out corruption within government relief programs, particularly within the Office for Prevention and Combat of Natural Disasters (DPCCN), which assists in food distributions, and at the Quelimane port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Decentralize decision-making by bestowing greater authority on government officials who work at district- and administrative-post levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The massive migration of Mozambicans back to their homes will create humanitarian emergencies to which local authorities must respond rapidly and with flexibility. Deciding which health clinics to build, which wells to repair, which small settlements to stock with food, or which tertiary roads to clear of landmines are decisions best handled at a grassroots level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overly centralized decision-making in Maputo would be cumbersome at best and potentially life-threatening at worst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Allow traditional nongovernmental community leaders to clarify local land tenure issues at a local level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Land disputes are inevitable as 5.5 million persons return home after years of displacement. Most returnees are subsistence farmers who possess virtually nothing but the ground beneath their feet. The land is their livelihood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Renamo initially capitalized on farmers' alienation over the government's former land tenure rules, and land ownership remains the single most sensitive political issue in the country. Government officials in Maputo lack the administrative resources and the grassroots credibility needed to resolve most individual land tenure disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Encourage political pluralism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has pledged its commitment to an open multiparty political system, including the participation of Renamo as a political party.  Government officials at all levels should maintain this commitment both before and after national elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Encourage reunification of families separated by the war, and establish foster family care programs for unaccompanied children instead of placing them in institutional orphanages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An estimated quarter-million or more children have been separated from or lost their families as a result of the war. NGOs in refugee camps have established extensive foster-family programs to care for unaccompanied minors, but Mozambican government agencies have limited experience operating foster care programs, and historically have placed such children into orphanages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The needs of unaccompanied minors may multiply as boy soldiers previously conscripted into Renamo ranks are suddenly free and alone without family, and many children currently supported by foster families in refugee camps will lose that support when they return to Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To Renamo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Allow unrestricted access to territory under Renamo control and grant complete freedom of movement by all Mozambicans, UN agencies, NGOs, and government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Renamo has granted improved access to relief officials since the ceasefire but continues to block or delay access in many instances. Evidence indicates that Renamo continues to impede free movement by many destitute families trying to exit Renamo-controlled regions in search of food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Renamo political and military leaders should cooperate fully with relief and development efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Renamo's distrust of outsiders and its own lack of knowledge about the requirements of relief operations have slowed relief efforts. In addition to granting humanitarian access, Renamo leaders should allow NGOs and UNHCR about arrivals of new returnees and other matters of humanitarian concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama should meet regularly--perhaps monthly--with Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two leaders have met face-to-face only twice in the past year despite repeated offers by President Chissano to meet with Dhlakama virtually anywhere at any time. Infrequent contact between Dhlakama and Chissano after so many years of warfare feeds mistrust between the two sides and heightens public concerns that the peace is shallow and impermanent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To the Government and Renamo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The government and Renamo should disarm and demobilize their troops without delay in accordance with written pledges made in last year's peace accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Renamo has consistently stalled troop demobilization, and the government has responded by keeping its troops armed. No meaningful disarmament had occurred by early November 1993, more than a full year after the signing of the accord, and seven months after the demobilization deadline originally agreed to by both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN peacekeepers are in place to provide protection, and demobilization sites have been identified, and programs to transport and resettle demobilized soldiers stand idle. Millions of Mozambicans cannot safely return to their homes until demobilization is completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Government officials and troops, and Renamo leaders and their soldiers in the field, should reveal the location of all landmines planted of discovered during the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The possible existence of one million or more landmines endangers all Mozambicans, particularly refugees and internally displaced families returning to former war zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although government officials have generally cooperated with the United Nations' landmine clearance efforts, suspicions persist that some government military commanders have withheld information about the locations of minefields, in expectation that they will eventually receive financial compensation for divulging the information. Renamo's assertions that it did not lay landmines during the war are not believable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government and Renamo should immediately make public all information about landmines as part of their pledge in the peace accord to &quot;undertake everything within their power for the achievement of genuine national reconciliation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Withholding information about the location of landmines to extort financial or political gain is unconscionable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To UNHCR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Adhere to the current strategy of providing egalitarian assistance to all Mozambicans--refugees and non-refugees alike--who are in need in returnee areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique is a devastated country. Many internally displaced Mozambicans find themselves in even worse condition than returning refugees.  UNHCR has correctly decided to stretch its mandate--and its budget--by rendering assistance to all Mozambicans who need assistance in returnee areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Maintain adequate staffing and resources for UNHCR's operations in Mozambique, and grant wide authority to UNHCR staff in the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Returnees will be endangered if UNHCR fails to fulfill its repatriation duties. NGOs in the country are clamoring for better UNHCR coordination of repatriation and resettlement activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency should expedite its hiring process to maintain sufficient staffing, and should ensure that its field staff possess the authority and resources required to address rapidly changing conditions in isolated returnee areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Encourage and facilitate cross-border reconnaissance visits into Mozambique by refugees in asylum countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refugees must obtain accurate information about conditions in their home areas of Mozambique so that they can determine when to repatriate.  Information-gathering visits by refugee representatives are the single most credible source of information for many refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNHCR should provide transportation assistance and diplomatic support to these trips as necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Provide transportation for refugees facing long journeys home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNHCR planners assume that the large majority of Mozambicans in Malawi will repatriate on foot or will purchase private transportation. This strategy is acceptable for short trips. Families facing journeys of several days, however, should qualify for more generous transportation assistance from UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Press for earlier landmine clearance along secondary and tertiary roads that are likely to be key access routes for returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNHCR has identified key access routes, but UN mine clearance crews may fail to reach these routes before returnees arrive. UNHCR should urge the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (UNOMOZ) to give the highest possible priority to clearance of returnee routes, including remote footpaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To NGOs (International Nongovernmental Organizations)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Improve coordination of operations in the field and develop programs sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of Mozambique's massive population on the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no excuse for poor coordination in Mozambique, where many NGOs are just beginning new programs in previously inaccessible areas, and where &quot;turf fights&quot; over established programs should not exist. Poor coordination could result in refugees returning to areas unstocked with food, trucks laden with returnees traveling roads not yet cleared of landmines, and wasteful construction of buildings in unpopulated districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NGOs cannot &quot;control&quot; the movements or destinations of returnees. NGOs should instead establish operations capable of anticipating the country's population flows and responding quickly to emerging needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Road repairs and programs that increase local food production should be high priorities. NGOs should sustain their commitment beyond emergency relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique is the poorest country on earth and will require decades of development effort. NGOs should shift from short-term to longer-term reconstruction and development as local conditions permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Seek opportunities to collaborate with Mozambicans inside and outside of the government at local levels, who generally would benefit from closer association with professional relief and development workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International NGOs can help impart valuable professional skills to local government officials and volunteers working for nongovernmental Mozambican organizations at the provincial and district levels. This process would empower local workers so that the countries formerly centralized government structure becomes more decentralized and responsive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To the United Nations and World Bank</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Keep UN peacekeeping troops in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mistrust between the government and Renamo remains a threat to permanent peace and hinders refugee repatriation. The UN should maintain its full peacekeeping contingent in Mozambique until full disarmament and demobilization are completed. The UN should keep a smaller peacekeeping force in place until the national election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In November 1993, the United Nations voted to extend UN operations in Mozambique for six additional months. More extensions will probably be necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Devote adequate UN resources to help ensure a fair, credible election with full popular participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN and other organizations should assist voter education, election planning and logistics, election monitoring, and other activities that encourage participatory democracy. The UN should enhance popular participation by exploring the feasibility of enabling refugees in asylum countries to cast absentee ballots during the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Sustain the United Nations' commitment beyond emergency relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambicans will be rebuilding their country's destroyed infrastructure and social structure for decades. UNOHAC should play a leadership role in coordinating the world community's assistance efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The World Bank should ease economic austerity measures so that Mozambique's government can hire teachers, doctors, and other humanitarian civil servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank should refrain from imposing artificial hardships on Mozambique and its people. Overdue reductions in the government's bloated payroll should not preclude hiring qualified teachers, doctors and other carefully selected personnel for closely monitored humanitarian endeavors.  International donors should be encouraged to proved funds for hiring local teachers and medical personnel in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To the United States and other Governments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Provide generous, sustained financial support to repatriation, resettlement, relief, and rehabilitation in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's largest refugee crisis can finally come to a satisfactory end if the United States and other major donors lend proper support. The United States should be commended for funding up to one-third of the early UNOMOZ budget and pledging $10.3 million to first-year repatriation expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sustained support will be essential, however. UNHCR's overall $203 million repatriation program for Mozambique remains 85 cents underfunded per dollar; a $12 million appeal by the International Federation of the Red Cross for repatriation and rehabilitation is 80 percent underfunded; other UN and NGO agencies will require hundreds of millions of additional dollars for the massive task of helping Mozambicans rebuild their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inadequate donor support in the next few years would sow the seeds for intractable suffering at a time when regional stability finally has become a real possibility for Mozambique and its neighbors in southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To Asylum Countries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Asylum countries should patiently allow Mozambican refugees to remain in asylum until they are prepared to repatriate voluntarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Swaziland, and Tanzania have--despite some justified criticisms--generally treated Mozambican refugees well in recent years and should be commended. The notable exception was South Africa, which for years refused to grant official asylum to Mozambicans and callously deported large numbers throughout the war. South African leaders finally signed agreements with UNHCR and Mozambique in late 1993 to provide better treatment of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six asylum countries should refrain from pushing refugees to repatriate prematurely or involuntarily. Mozambique remains dangerous, and Mozambicans should be allowed to return at their own pace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Asylum countries should allow and facilitate cross- border reconnaissance trips into Mozambique by refugee representatives so that refugees can gain crucial eyewitness information about conditions at their destination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refugees must have accurate information about conditions in their home areas of Mozambique so that they can determine when to repatriate. Reports about conditions deep inside the country may not reach refugee camps outside the country. Fact-finding visits are the most credible source of information for many refugees. Asylum countries should encourage these cross-border journeys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Asylum countries should allow Mozambican refugees to cast absentee ballots if they are unable to repatriate voluntarily prior to the scheduled October 1994 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNHCR predicts that as many as half of all Mozambican refugees will still be in asylum countries in October 1994 due to poor conditions in Mozambique. Enabling refugees to participate in the election by casting absentee ballots is logistically difficult but would enhance the credibility of the elections and contribute to national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Malawi should provide improved security for refugees traveling home to Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Security in and around refugee camps in Malawi has deteriorated. Some refugees who have repatriated to Mozambique report that they have been victimized by bandits and by Malawi police. Mozambicans who have endured years of upheaval should not be subjected to the danger that their meager provisions will be stolen on the journey home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. South Africa should render assistance to refugees before and during repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After years of callous disregard for the well-being of Mozambican refugees, South African officials in September agreed for the first time to allow UNHCR protection and assistance for Mozambican refugees in South Africa. In October, South African authorities signed an agreement to help plan for the refugees' repatriation. South African officials have also indicated an interest in providing assistance inside Mozambique to agricultural projects, water supply programs, and skills training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African authorities should build on these welcome and long overdue steps.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFRICA NEWS SERVICE, January 27, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's a worrisome thing when a president whose capital is fighting an undeclared urban war laments, &quot;I have no army.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is doubly troublesome when that president leads a democracy that has been considered a role model for the entire sub-Saharan region. President Pascal Lissouba, who became this Central African nation's first freely elected president in 1992 following 30 years of Marxist rule, actually does have an army; he just doesn't feel that he quite controls it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, by all accounts, he doesn't. But that is only one among several problems faced by him and other African leaders who head new democracies plagued with too many guns and too little experience with Western-style multi- party politics. The tension could spark a period of upheaval unseen since the battles for independence 40 years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Congo is experiencing its first ethnic-based fighting since 1958. To the east, Burundi's politically inspired ethnic battles left its first freely elected president and up to 100,000 other people dead last fall. In southern Africa, after fighting a 16-year was Angolans took up arms again 15 months ago when the opposition rejected its loss in the country's first democratic presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To too many politicians, said one Western diplomat who spoke on condition that he not be named, &quot;democracy has just become another vehicle of ethnic domination through the ballot box.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Congo is inching dangerously close to a full-blown civil war. A political impasse has touched off ethnic fighting that has left up to 1,500 people dead in the capital Brazzaville in the past two months alone, diplomats and aid workers say. Another 400,000 people, half of the city's population, have been displaced as civilian militias split neighborhoods into opposition and pro-government strongholds, according to UNICEF, the U.N.  Children's Fund. Arms flow freely into the country from South Africa and across the Congo River from anarchy- plagued Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The economy is suffering considerably. One of every 10 Brazzaville residents works for the bloated civil service and has gone without pay for nine months. Few people even bother to work more than a few hours a day.  Congo's currency -- along with that of 13 other former French colonies -- was devalued this month by half, effectively cutting state salaries and raising food prices. Bread is scarce and the rail link between Brazzaville and the southern Pointe-Noire port was partially dismantled by opposition militants.  Port workers are on strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It wasn't always like this. Only two years ago this oft-rich nation was euphoric over an end to authoritarian rule. Democratic elections followed a national conference which featured open debate that had been unthinkable under military ruler Denis Sassou-Nguesso. The conference stripped him of his powers and a transitional government wrote a new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citizens of the newly democratic Congo tended to look with pity at their neighbors in Zaire, who are still struggling under the nearly quarter century-long dictatorship of President Mobutu Sese Seko. In recent years, economic despair has brought Zaireans in droves to seek wealth and refuge on Congolese shores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, however, it could be Congolese who end up launching their pirogues to cross the river towards the relative calm of Zaire, a move akin to abandoning a burning house for a sinking ship.;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Congo's troubles began after legislative elections last May that the opposition, led by Bernard Kolelas, accused the government of rigging. The opposition boycotted the second round of voting in June, and armed clashes began between government and opposition supporters in Brazzaville's suburbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fighting quickly took on ethnic overtones because political parties largely had coalesced around ethnic allegiance. Two southern groups, the Laris and Niboleks, are at the center of the conflict. Lari &quot;ninjas&quot; are fighting against both Nibolek militias and Lissouba's personally formed commandos known as the Aubevillois. No buses or taxis dare enter the capital's embattled neighborhoods. The U.S. ambassador's home, on the periphery of an affected area, was sprayed with machine-gun crossfire last week. No one was injured, but the incident has prompted the evacuation of 25 embassy dependents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have fallen into fear and terror,&quot; said a young Lari man, a member of the opposition party's cabinet, who is in hiding in central Brazzaville because he fears being arrested or killed by government paramilitary forces.  Aid workers say bodies lie in the streets of sealed-off neighborhoods, are buried in shallow graves or thrown into the Congo River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are really, really awful ethnic atrocities going on here now,&quot; said the diplomat. Congolese now call the Bakongo neighborhood Serajevo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the killings are blamed on Lissouba's Aubevillois, a heavily armed militia of about 500 young men who are quickly gaining a reputation on par with the tonton macoutes of Haiti who carried out a campaign of terror to silence government opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lissouba created the Aubevillois, named after the place where they were trained, to deal with the problems that erupted in Bakongo. The regular army, which numbers about 14,000, had refused to intervene to stop the fighting between pro- and anti-government forces. Largely from the north, like their former leader Sassou-Nguesso, the military feared being drawn into bloody north-south conflict. Northerners, who had been favored by the French colonial rulers, continued to dominate the country after independence in 1960 until Lissouba came to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lissouba, a 62-year old geneticist, denies that he stocked the Aubevillois with members of his own ethnic group for protection, saying it was simply a matter of convenience because they happened to live near the camp and the government didn't have enough money to recruit from the entire country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He resents the loyalty Sassou-Npuesso still enjoys among armed forces and accuses him of helping arm opposition militias. &quot;I have no army here. I just come from the outside and I have been absent from here during roughly 20 years,&quot; he said in an interview, referring to his time abroad when Sassou-Nguesso was busy recruiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regular army refuses to let Lissouba's Aubevillois be integrated into their forces. Although the army outnumbers them, but the Aubevillois are said to be well-armed with weapons from South Africa and Lissouba said he plans to increase their numbers by 2,000 and to broaden their ethnic base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Today security is the priority,&quot; said Clement Mierassa, a former presidential candidate with the opposition Congolese Social Democratic Party.  &quot;If the ninjas weren't there we wouldn't be talking about democracy anymore.  The opposition would have already been broken.&quot; Critics of the Social Democrats counter that it was the ninjas who began the ethnic purges last June by chasing non-Laris from their neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While security is now the chief preoccupation of both sides in the conflict, Congo has still managed to maintain democratic institutions, namely the Parliament, where opposition and government delegates meet regularly. In addition, a mediator has established contact between Lissouba, Kolelas and Sassou-Nguesso. A cease-fire went into effect last Sunday and the capital has been relatively quiet since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the coming week is a crucial one and should indicate just how committed the government and the opposition are to the democratic process.  The International College of Arbitrators, a body of European and African observers that was selected to help break the political impasse, is to decide by Feb. 5 whether the opposition or the presidential movement holds the parliamentary majority. Their ruling will be based on reviews of the disputed legislative elections. Under the constitution, the majority nominates the prime minister, who appoints the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If they say the parliamentary majority rests in the hands of the presidential movement, we will accept it,&quot; said Kolelas in a telephone interview. &quot;That is democracy. I'm not the president's enemy. He's my brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lissouba has also suggested the possibility of creating a &quot;government of national unity,&quot; but said he frowned on running ministries with members of different political parties unless he could choose the ministers from a broad selection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A peaceful settlement of Congo's political problems could be an inspiration for pro-democracy advocates in other African countries. And Congo itself can look to Burundi for inspiration and hope. After the murder of its president, the east African nation has just selected a new president and is moving forward with the democratic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lissouba is seeking a $1 billion bridge loan from the World Bank to implement social and economic reforms that he hopes will ease the strains that led to conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a challenge for us to start now and to have a democracy after one year&quot; of transition, Lissouba said, &quot;It is not possible. We have to give five years to 10 years&quot; to move toward full democratic rule. The constitution, modeled on those of France and the United States, &quot;cannot fit with our culture now. It is not what we're used to.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SUDAN DEMOCRATIC GAZETTE, February 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. George Carey, and his wife Eileen spent probably the most difficult and dangerous four nights of their lives when they visited Southern Sudan. There were difficulties and dangers which they need not have exposed themselves to, yet millions of Southern Sudanese are very grateful that they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In successfully undertaking the visit to Southern Sudan, the Archbishop has focused the world's attention upon the plight of the people of Southern Sudan, Christian and non-Christian alike. In making the visit Dr.  Carey has also carried out a biblical obligation to sympathise with the weak, the poor and the needy. He has fulfilled an important step in Christian solidarity with the Southern people, a step unmatched since the first Christian missionaries entered the South in the early years of this century.  His visit is as significant for the Southern people as when the British colonial administration entered the South and made it a closed district within which they prohibited by law any act of slavery.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For nearly forty years Southern Sudan has struggled against repression by the North. The modern variety of Islamic Fundamentalism just happens to be the worst ever seen. Forcible Islamicisation and Arabisation of the Southern people did not begin with the present regime, but new extremes of brutality have been reached as a result of its policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Northern Sudan, the people of the Nuba Mountains have been singled out for particular repression, persecution and ethnic cleansing. These persecuted people have looked to the international community for help and salvation in the past with apparently little response. Dr. Carey has now demonstrated that the outside world can bypass Khartoum and help the people of the South and the Nuba Mountains directly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An important aspect of the Archbishop's visit for the Christian community world-wide is that Christianity is alive and flourishing in Southern Sudan. In fact, it seems that the greater the attempts by Khartoum to forcibly convert Southerners to Islam, the more Southerners become Christians t demonstrate their defiance. This is a fact which ought to dissuade Christian communities and church leaders around the world from seemingly sacrificing Sudan's Christians in the process of achieving dialogue with the Islamic Fundamentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the period of the build-up to Dr. Carey's visit, Christians in both Northern and Southern Sudan feared that it would be taken over by the Khartoum regime and manipulated for political gain. Everyone remembers how the Pope's visit in February last year had been manipulated for propaganda purposes at the last minute. When the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to be bullied and intimidated by Khartoum's last minute demands, and instead cancelled his visit to Northern Sudan whilst going ahead with the visit to the South, this gave all Christians in Sudan renewed confidence that they are not on their own. Khartoum was so disturbed at its failure to manipulate Dr.  Carey's visit, and ultimately its inability to prevent his visit to the South, that it was prepared to instigate a full-scale war with Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All along the Archbishop of Canterbury had made it known that his visit was going to be a spiritual and pastoral one. He had no intention of allowing Khartoum to reduce the visit to a political contest. He saw no need to go out of his way to appease a regime which is actively repressing its own people. He opted for the way of Christ rather than the way of diplomatic nicety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khartoum's efforts to take over Dr. Carey's visit certainly rebounded upon its propaganda machine, largely because the controversy created gave the visit extended international media coverage that it might not have warranted had it gone ahead as originally planned. The decision by Khartoum to expel the British ambassador and to launch a full scale diplomatic row with the British government made Dr. Carey's visit even more newsworthy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IPC (International Preparatory Committee) Met In Kampala, Uganda on December 9th, 10th, and 11th (1993) and discussed the plans for the rescheduling of the 7th Pan African Congress. The new dates will be April 3-8, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twenty years ago Africans around the globe convened for the purpose of holding the long awaited 6th Pan African Congress. The conference came about after the idea of Pan Africanism had taken its second dive since the 5th PAC was held in 1945. This was the last PAC attended and led by the founding father of Pan Africanism, the late Dr. W.E.B. Dubois.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Dubois went to France in December 1918 to address the Peace Congress, being held at Versailles, about his idea of calling a &quot;Pan African Congress.&quot; At the time he was without credentials or influence, but the idea took on. This led to the First Pan African Congress which assembled in Paris in February 1919. Of the fifty-seven delegates that attended, only nine countries and twelve delegates represented the African continent. Although Africa was partially represented (most of Africa was still colonized at the time), the main goals of the decolonization of Africa and African unity still prevailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pan African Congress continued to assemble periodically from 1919 to 1927, and was still mostly an American idea rather than African. By 1929 the Pan African Movement was losing ground and a desperate effort was made to hold the 5th PAC on the African continent. This attempt however was blocked by both the French government, who would not allow the Congress to meet in Tunis or in other of its colonies in Africa, and the Great Depression.  Fifteen years later in 1945, the Word Trade Union Conference met in Paris, France. It was here that black laborers fro the Caribbean, America, and parts of Europe got together and called for a 5th PAC to be held in the Republic of Liberia. After reviewing the situation, the convening committee decided to hold the Congress in Manchester, England just days after the World Trade Union Conference. Despite the effort, difficulties of transportation and passport restriction made the attendance limited. However those who did participate in the conference, such Kwame Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta, Obafemi Awolowo, T.B. Makonnen, and others, were later to play a prominent role in the decolonization of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost thirty years would pass before the PAC would reconvene. During this time many African countries were slowly gaining independence from colonial rule. Ghana, formerly The Gold Coast, was the first to receive its independence in 1957. In April 1958, the incumbent President, Kwame Nkrumah, called a meeting of all independent African states at the time, and this meeting became known as the First Pan African Conference to be held on African soil. Later that year another conference was called, this time including both independent states and nationalist movements. Sixty-two Liberation Nationalist and Liberation Movements were represented. Patrice Lumumba, Abdul-Rahman Babu, Nelson Mandela, and Sekou Toure just to name a few. Similar conferences were held in Tunis and Cairo between 1961 and 1962.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1963, thirty-two independent states met in Addis Ababa and formed the Organization of African Unity, whose charter and purpose was a compromise of the radical and moderate nationalist leaders. The radicals wanted to see the immediate redemption of Africa by any means necessary, including armed struggle , while the moderates on the other hand wanted to take a slower approach in the unity of Africa. Militants and Pan Africanists were openly disappointed with the limitations of the OAU, because it did not advocate the participation or offer solidarity of Diasporic Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This soon led to the revival of the Pan African Movement and the PAC series. The initiative for a 6th PAC came from a small group of African American and African Caribbeans who met in the United States and Bermuda in 1971 and '72. The committee organized and the 6th PAC took place in June 1974 at the University of Dar-es-Salaam, and was attended by fifty-two delegations from African and Caribbean states, liberation movements, two hundred and fifty African Americans, and communities of diasporans from South America, Britain, and the Pacific. Issues on the agenda were: independence through armed struggle , the question of imperialism and neo-colonialism, the underdevelopment of third world countries, education and culture, colonialism in the Caribbean, and the role of African women. Unfortunately there was the inability to make concrete resolutions so that they could be carried out, and there was no organizational structure for the Congress itself to serve as an institutional base. So once again the Pan African Congress would lie dormant for another twenty years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After a series of meetings by the International Planning Committee, the date and place was set for the 7th Pan African Congress. The conference was to be held in Kampala, Uganda in December 1993. However, after some logistical problems, the 7th PAC was canceled and rescheduled for April 3-8, 1994. The broad theme of the Congress is: PAN AFRICANISM: Facing the Future in Unity, Social Progress and Democracy. Some main issues on the agenda are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * A determination of the scope of the political and economic unity of Africa and Africans worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Acceptance of the notion that Pan Africanism represents the basis of a viable and absolutely necessary project, to which all Africans must subscribe, and this should be the base for foreign policy formulation and projection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Planning Committee aspires that the Congress not be just a forum for ideas, but an historic opportunity to formulate a plan of action. The IPC will also oversee the continuation of PAC conferences in the future. It would be a tragedy to let the Pan African Movement sleep for another twenty years. by the will of God, history will be made this April in Kampala, Uganda. We look forward to seeing you there.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, January 21-27, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's tentative backing for abortion on demand in its draft health policy has already drawn criticism from pro-lifers. It is one of several highly contentious suggestions in the ANC's draft plan released this week, which emphasises public sector health at the expense of the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The support for women's choice on abortion is hedged with a note that &quot;the issues around abortion remain contentious and need to be discussed and debated further.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move to support abortion is also likely to stir up feelings with in the ANC itself, where the issue of abortion is by no means settled.  Another issue likely to cause controversy is the suggestion that medical graduates be forced to work for the state for a period -- or repay state loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reaction of the Medical Association of South Africa to the plan has been muted, with the association saying it is &quot;encouraged&quot; by the policy proposals in general. Masa merely notes that &quot;to discourage growth in the private sector is debatable&quot;. It also says ambitious time schedules could create unrealistic expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Centre for Health Policy Studies' Max Price comments that there is a contradiction in the document which later talks about contracting the private sector to provide services for the public sector, which would entail growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Price believes that overall the document offers health care workers a rosy future, albeit in a regulated environment. The move to bar doctors dispensing medicines they themselves have prescribed will cause unhappiness among some members of Masa itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is also unclear how the bar on medical practitioners buying shares in private clinics is to work. Dr. Gordon Cohen of Clinic Holdings notes the move could not be done retrospectively and he doubts its feasibility. &quot;Our doctors are free to buy Clinic Holdings shares on the JES.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plan proposes free basic medical care. Some proposals are also likely to send shivers up the spine of the pharmaceutical industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC plan, which runs to 100 pages and was presented this week in Johannesburg by health and welfare supremo Cheryl Carolous, calls for a strengthening of the public health sector and the availability of basic medical care to the whole population. Free health care would be available to children under six, pregnancy and nursing mothers, the elderly, disabled and chronically ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Free medical services would include immunisation, regular screening procedures to detect cancer, ante-natal care and child delivery, contraceptives, feeding support and treatment for TB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national health service would be financed through current income tax levels, claims the ANC. Extra revenue would come from steep increases in the prices of tobacco and alcohol. Patients with health insurance or medical aids will face steep charges at public hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an attempt to redirect resources towards the public sector, the plan would regulate private health care, which it says currently channels resources disproportionately to wealthier, healthier people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SUNDAY NATION, January 9, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The election date is now less than four months away. Most of the political work is fairly well advanced with last month's passing of the Electoral Act by parliament and the subsequent establishment of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the most difficult work that lies ahead, it seems, is getting the voters to mark the ballot paper in the correct way to avoid spoiling their votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Independence Forum for Electoral Education -- a coalition of about 60 organisations -- is now racing against time to ensure that on April 27 every voter knows what to do when he or she gets to the polling station.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Work to educate the nation about elections started as long ago as December 1991, more than a year before the election date was agreed at the multiparty negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spearheading the operation was the University of the Western Cape's Centre for Development Studies and the American-based National Democratic Institute for International Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These institutions arranged an election seminar which was attended by representatives from several mass-based organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In May 1991, Matla Trust got together with the Democratic Party and the Damelin Management School to design a curriculum for the training of election managers, monitors and voter educators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After this process, 300 trainees from eight regions of the country were recruited from political organisations, churches, trade unions, civic and other mass-based groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trainees attended a 10-day seminar entitled, &quot;Training the Trainer&quot; and they were later sent back to conduct training in their own areas and organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To date, according to the Matla Trust's community and citizen education head, Terrence Tryon, 70,000 election trainers have been trained countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, until now, the training has been broad, said Tryon. The passing of the Electoral Act will allow Matla Trust and other organisations within the coalition to sharpen the training, basing it on the provisions of the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a low of work, it seems, is still to be done. A large number of rural areas and farm communities have yet to learn what an election means and how it is conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People living in rural areas do not have any means of getting information on the elections. Radio, television or newspapers are not an affordable commodity in these areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only avenue to reach them is by getting someone to physically meet and talk to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tribal chiefs and churches -- which seem to be the most credible structures in rural areas -- will be used to help voter educators reach the rural communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when it comes to farms, where the owners may decide not to give access to voter educators, the coalition will have to resort to the provisions of the Electoral Act which ;makes it illegal for farm owners to stop anybody who seeks to reach voters living on their property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Delmas, the Catholic Church has found a way of getting around this problem. In co-operation with farm workers' activities, voting seminars are held with farm workers in nearby Botleng township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Punish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, this method cannot be applicable in all areas as some farm owners would punish their employees simply because they went to attend such workshops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Delmas, farm workers' activists complain about low turnouts as workers fear reprisals from their employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is also a costly exercise because transport has to be provided to take the workers to and form the workshop venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tryon says the provision of the Electoral Act stipulating that pictures of leaders of the various contending political parties will be printed on each ballot paper, will make voter education easier, because many people will identify the party they support through seeing its leader's pictures rather than its colours or logo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parties like Inkatha, according to a Matla Trust research, would suffer a major disadvantage if logos were to be used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The research found that 50 percent of 800 respondents did not know what Inkatha's logo looks like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, leaders of parties such as Azapo and small parties whose leaders are rarely on television or pictured in newspapers will get very little benefit from this provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is still a long way to go, Tryon says, but he is confident that on April 27 every voter will be able to correctly mark the party of his or her choice on the ballot paper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAILY OBSERVER, Tuesday, January 18, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Gambia is no more. The privately-owned air carrier, which has been transporting passengers and goods in large numbers to London and Freetown weekly, announced yesterday that it had ceased operation &quot;with immediate effect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman for the airline said although it had enjoyed satisfactory loads, the fares on its London/Banjul/Freetown route &quot;had become so diluted as to make it impossible to operate viable scheduled services.&quot; He went on to state that very significant losses had been incurred by the airline since its inception, and not one flight had succeeded in making a contribution towards overheads or the full recovery of the airline's direct operating costs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the spokesman, the chequered history of the airline was well known to the public. And prior to being taken into administration, a euphemistic word for receivership, losses amounting to US$2 million had arisen, the bulk of which had been borne by the airline's minority shareholders, Omega, based in Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It may be recalled that Air Gambia was the subject of an interim administration order issued by the Supreme Court last June under the Insolvency Act of 1992. According to that order, Messrs. Raymond Davies and Peter Terry of KPMG Peat Marwick were appointed administrators of the company pending the outcome of a petition filed by Omega Air Limited of Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liquidation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following receipt of the unsigned message on its fax machine early yesterday afternoon, the Daily Observer contacted Mr. Raymond Davies, managing partner of Peat Marwick, who confirmed that Air Gambia was indeed ceasing operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They are not going to fly any more. They're liquidating their operations,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Davies went on to throw more light on the collapse of Air Gambia.  He said after Peat Marwick had been called in as administrators of the airline, they sold it to the West African Trading and Mining Co. According to the press release, this company inherited a deficit of nearly US$500,000 and continued to accumulate losses of not less than US$20,000 on every service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gambia Airways Shares</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Davies disclosed to this newspaper that it had been the intention of the new company to take over the 40 per cent equity in Gambia Airways, which was owned by British Airways. But in the Gambia Government's privatisation of Gambia Airways, the British Airways shares were sold to Mr.  Alieu Conteh, a Gambian businessman based in Brussels. Failure to obtain these shares, which would have provided a much-needed boost to Air Gambia's viability, spelt doom for the beleaguered airline, according to Mr. Davies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only thing that might have saved it, he said, was if they had increased their fares by 50 per cent at least, in order to bring it up to the level set by the International Air Travel Association (IATA) .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that was an unlikely prospect, in an environment flooded with charter flights carrying thousands of passengers, mainly tourists, into and out of The Gambia every week at rock-bottom prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Air Gambia spokesman said the decision to cease trading by West African Mining and Trading was therefore inevitable, and had only been delayed by the advent of the festive season and the need to ensure that passengers who had previously booked were able to travel back to their homes and loved ones. Indeed this had only been possible because of the immense goodwill of Omega Air in continuing to provide the aircraft on a complimentary basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He praised the staff of the airline who, he said, &quot;had performed magnificently but against impossible odds.&quot; &quot;Their loyalty and dedication has, in the circumstances, been exemplary,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the directors of the airline wish to express their sincere regret for the inconvenience that will be caused to passengers as the result of this unavoidable cessation of trading.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, January 21-January 25, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Museveni, incensed by the increasing inefficiency in army administration, this week, is reported to have released a volley of criticism and rebukes against some army top brass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a highly placed military source, the president chairing the Army Council meeting in Kampala on Wednesday January 19, 1994 was particularly bitter with the army leadership for dragging him into &quot;petty administration matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First to come under fire was the Chief of Logistics and Engineering, Lt. Col.. Dr. Kizza Besigye. He was held responsible for neglecting soldiers' welfare, a number of whom are now going almost naked. The situation was said to be particularly bad for those now serving in up-country stations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president charged that efforts to supply the army with uniforms, boots and mattresses are often frustrated by some corrupt officers until he himself moves in to push and threaten the Military Tender Board and the Treasury in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tender board is accused among other crimes of dealing more with briefcase suppliers and concentrating more on kickbacks than establishing contacts with more reliable suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To cool the president's anger, Besigye reportedly took to the floor promising to secure more boots, uniforms and mattresses for the army &quot;by the end of next month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every soldier is supposed to get a new uniform every six months, a pair of new boots every one year, and a new mattress every two years. But the situation has become so pathetic that it is said to have topped the agenda for the Wednesday Army Council meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president and some Division commanders were particularly dismayed by the fact that despite an emergency session which was called last year to discuss the problem of welfare and supplies, it was still topping the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president reportedly spent some time quarreling about increasing corruption, inefficiency and non-performers in the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The directorate of construction was singled out as an example for non -performance. Some time back Museveni is said to have told the head of this unit to use money voted for construction to erect an armory in every barracks and Division headquarters but &quot;the fellow did not put up any&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president is also reported to be disturbed by the rate of drunkards in the army, more especially the commanders who go to the bars very early in the day before finding out what is happening in their units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He informed the council that the conflict between the police and the army over Lt. Col. Nyanzi Drago's arrest had been resolved. In future, an army officer will be arrested only if caught in the act or after informing the most senior army officer in the locality or unit in which the officer comes from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the police has evidence implicating any army officer they have to contact the army which will then effect the arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the on-going CA exercise, the president is said to have reiterated army's promise to abide by any decisions reached by the masses democratically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The army will follow whatever avenue upholds the unity of the country,&quot; the source quoted Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president also reportedly warned division and brigade commanders not to sway soldiers into voting for any particular candidate. &quot;Do not sway soldiers, let them decide themselves on whom to vote for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some candidates near army barracks like in Mbarara have expressed fears that the large number of soldiers could be manipulated into voting for one particular candidate especially those seen as NRM (National Resistance Movement , the ruling party). The fears had prompted some of them to suggest that soldiers should not vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The voluntary retirement of soldiers in the second phase of the lay-off exercise due at the end of March or early April was also reportedly discussed. It was agreed that the army retains the prerogative to stay a soldier requesting for voluntary retirement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, January 7-13, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You won't find Max Du Preez, the ever-ebullient founder and editor of &quot;Vrye Weekblad&quot;, looking down in the mouth about this week's decision to close his five-year-old publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We could have carried on for a few months and burnt up some more money. But when we discussed it, I thought about the British Anti-Apartheid Movement. They didn't know when to go. We don't want to make the same mistake.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want to go while people still care. In a few more months, they would have stopped caring,&quot; he said in an interview this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Many people have phoned me and said it's terrible and we can't possibly close now. Individuals have offered a total of R1,5-million to keep us going. I personally have taken calls from three people each offering R200,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This shows us that our timing was right. Quit while people will still miss you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These people are kind, but it wouldn't change our basic situation. We have never had advertising support. We have a flood of legal costs. And we cater to a tine constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We outgrew that market because of the edge we had and because we offered quality. But I am not sure we have that edge any more. Now we're just bleeding ourselves dry,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Du Preez also turned down an offer to merge with his competition, Nasionale Pers' &quot;Insig&quot; and &quot;Die Suid Afrikaan.&quot; On the surface, the deal was good: the new publication would be independent, edited by Du Preez and would have a good shot at creating one viable product from three struggling magazines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea broke down because Naspers said it should be monthly, and Du Preez said it was weekly or nothing. &quot;We would be putting our masthead on something we didn't like,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So nothing it is and after the final edition on February 2, Du Preez will dismantle the unconventional newsroom he had built from nothing over the past five years. He works from the Old Scout Hall in Brixton, a quaint building with the feeling of a small, rural church. The colourful posters and photographs on the walls seem to ridicule the quasi-religious building -- appropriately for a magazine that has build its name on mocking Afrikaans institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the wall, hovering over the room like a religious icon, is a painting by artist Braam Kruger showing a (coloured) Joan of Arc-like figure, bursting out of the burning ruins of the old South Africa wielding a copy of &quot;Vrye Weekblad&quot; in one hand and a sword in the other, a &quot;wit wolf&quot; snapping at her heels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's the original &quot;Vrye Weekblad&quot;: battling for a cause against all the odds , never mincing its words, never backing away from a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So what's changed? Partly, it is a sense that their fight is over.  Mostly, it is that Du Preez himself is tired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But ask him about the publication's achievements, and he is energetic again. &quot;Our major achievement was inside the Afrikaans constituency.  Afrikaners did not ask difficult questions, they respected their leaders...Our style was confrontational, we kicked arse, we loosened up the minds of Afrikaners and helped them break these attitudes. We showed them that their leaders were morally and financially corrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And we showed people that you could be part of the struggle &quot;and&quot; speak Afrikaans. You didn't have to become Anglicised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Before we came along, most blacks thought Afrikaners were dumb, thick-wristed &quot;boers&quot; who suppressed them. We made then see that we weren't all like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With &quot;The Weekly Mail&quot; and &quot;New Nation: and others, we helped push back the parameters of press freedom. When all the mainstream guys were complacent and accepted the limits, we had a role in challenging those limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;On a different level, we showed young Afrikaners that there was fun to be had. That there is life beyond the National Party, the NG Kerk, the Broederbond and Christian National Education.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And what will Du Preez himself do? &quot;I have no plans and no firm job offers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am burnt out in th print media. There are no hobs for me there. I need to earn a proper salary for 18 months, until I can afford to go and run the small farm I have bought. That's been my dream from boyhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He picked up his small farm near Ficksburg for very little when there was drought and a spate of racial murders. &quot;Now there's plenty of rain and no Apla ,&quot; he said'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That provides ideal conditions for farming, not for alternative journalism.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, January 7-13, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current boom on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is a forerunner to stronger economic growth in 1994 than originally expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economists are busy revising their growth projections upwards, following the JSE bull run which began in early December and continued unabated through the festive season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Early January saw some of the most frenzied activity in the JSE's history. Share prices soared, pushing sectoral indices to record levels and catapulting market capitalisation (the amount of money invested in the market) to a record R740-billion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's been a mad time,&quot; said one broker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behind the rush is a steady increase in the gold price to nearly $400 as well as an influx of foreign money -- particularly American unit trusts and pensions funds. South African investors also expect falling inflation to force the Reserve Bank to lower interest rates, thereby rendering the share market an even better investment option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A heavy foreign buyer of South African stocks has been the black-run Episcopal Church Pension Fund. Cash-flush American fund managers are looking at various foreign markets into which they can diversify. They are targeting emerging markets, of which South Africa is one. The JSE has been particularly attractive because of the relative cheapness of shares here as a result of the dual exchange rate system which makes local shares 20 percent cheaper for foreigners than for South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, local companies have impressed foreigners by having withstood the brutal recession of the past four years and come out intact.  Blue chip companies such as South African Breweries, Premier and Anglo American Industrial Corporation are also seen to be in an ideal position to expand into the rest of the continent and increase their exports in a post-General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;US funds fear they may lost out on great opportunities if they don't get into the South African market now,&quot; say Barlows economist Pieter Haasbroek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa has been helped by instability in Russia, which might create disruptions in new markets in central and eastern Europe. In comparison, the installation of the Transitional Executive Council has boosted confidence in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A lot of people outside are gaining confidence in South Africa. The fact that we reached a constitutional settlement without outside intervention was an indication to them that we can solve our problems, says Bank of Lisbon economist Paulo Fernandes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surprisingly, the high level of violence -- which is often touted as a deterrent to foreigners -- has been ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Explains Econometrix's Tony Twine: &quot;Foreign observers are becoming desensitised to violence. Perceptions of it having a destructive effect on the economy are being reduced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the effects of the bull run are unlikely to be felt on the real economy for quite some time. Economists say the money which local investors have poured into the JSE will start having an impact in the second quarter of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Bank of Lisbon's &quot;Economic Focus&quot;, any advance in industrial shares usually precedes an upswing in the business cycle by between five and 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Haasbroek concurs, pointing out that local interest in shares comes from a belief among investors that reasonable growth is going to be experienced this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Manufacturing production is on the increase and employment is going to pick up. Inflation is falling and this will probably lead to a decline in interest rates,&quot; says Haasbroek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Market players are expecting the bull run to continue for quite some time. An increase in manufacturing production and the expectation of good performances by industrial concerns over the 12 months will keep industrial share strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gold price is likely to remain stable, thereby boosting god shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The US fund managers have also only invested a tiny fraction of a percentage and many others are still waiting for the April 27 elections before they invest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Most people expect the bull ruin to be sustained,&quot; says Mathieson and Hollidge managing director Peter Redding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, Friday, January 28- February 1,1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PRESIDENT Yoweri Museveni in his Kololo Airstrip speech to mark</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the NRM's 8th anniversary attacked a new-found enemy: the National Organisation for Civic Education and Election Monitoring (NOCEM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MUSEVENI got so angry, he asked what business NOCEM has monitoring the elections. &quot;Who are they?&quot; he asked. Museveni singled out Nathan Karema who was the UPC government's District Commissioner of Luwero during the NRA's brush war and had become Chief Monitor in Mbarara. Karema, according to the president, caused a lot of suffering in Luwero.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TRUE, as Museveni said, people who monitor should have clean records.  His argument that the monitoring should not be used for politicking and confusing the voters is well taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MONITORS are supposed to be neutral, otherwise the process loses meaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUT the president's seeming blanket condemnation of NOCEM as an organisation is confusing. NOCEM is a collection of 12 law abiding nongovernmental organisations including journalists groups and the Uganda Law Society. If there is a &quot;bad&quot; person, that does not mean NOCEM has lost the moral legitimacy to monitor. It would be like saying that because there are a few criminals and corrupt people in NRM,. it has no business being in government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHAT right does NOCEM have to monitor elections? Well, it is their right as citizens. The same right they have to vote. As citizens they have a right to see that the process is fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AND we think the idea of people who were involved with the Amin or Obote governments not being able to monitor could be carried too far. It seems the NRM takes the view that &quot;agents&quot; of Obote and Amin who are &quot;NRM agents&quot; are okay; but those who are not pro-NRM are bad. Why this should be the case is not clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAREMA'S case brings many of these issues into focus. When he appeared before the Human Rights Commission to give evidence about atrocities in Luwero, the Commission heard his testimony in camera. There are enough incredible rumours why that was the case. He has been arrested several times, but has not been convicted by a court of law. There are reports that he has made some money supplying to government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALL these tell us that we should guard against the political condemnation of people by the government of the day. A lot of innocent people were slaughtered because they were politically condemned as &quot;Obote people&quot; by Amin. Many people were killed during Obote II because they were &quot;Museveni's guerrillas.&quot; Now we could see the NRM returning the compliments, by placing Amin and Obote &quot;agents&quot; under a political sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WE hope NOCEM will not be scared into appointing only people who are approved by the government; and this is likely. The idea of local monitoring groups is relatively new in Africa. Many governments, not surprisingly, prefer the foreign to local monitors. This is because the local monitors have a longer presence and understand the local groups know the political terrain better. Foreign ones can be manipulated more easily by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT would be ABSOLUTELY wrong in future to seek to close citizens out of civic activities because they are &quot;Museveni agents.&quot; As Museveni said, if these &quot;agents&quot; are criminals, let them be tried for their crimes. It would be a very sad day when Ugandans will have to trade in their political rights for forgiveness of their past &quot;political&quot; crimes by the government of the day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH, February 14,1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following is excerpted from a keynote address at a conference organised by Arewa House, February 2, in Kaduna on the state of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Babangida is the main architect of the state in which the nation finds itself today and General Abacha was his eminent disciple, faithful supporter and beneficiary. But when some of us saw the light, or is it darkness, if some half a dozen serious, responsible, principled and respected voices all over the country had joined to raise an alarm publicly, we would not be in the situation we are today. The alarm might have been heeded and harrowing experiences avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of us here today cannot escape the charge of being accomplices and being guilty through silence. Speaking up and doing so early, objectively, seriously and concertedly might have prevented the destruction which occurred. While private urgings may be good, they are insufficient when a government is deaf and mischievous. Such a government sees private urgings and correspondence either as tacit approval or an invitation to be quietly settled. It would have been better for us to step on a couple of toes and some economic interests rather than allow the country to be bankrupted and destroyed almost to the point of irreparability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let us attempt to draw a number of parallels between the present administration which must be part of the yard-stick of the measurement of the state of the nation, and its full military predecessor under whose tutelage it was for eight years. The moral underpinning of one was hollow through and through. The moral underpinning of the other is no better. General Sani Abacha reminds one of a man who, with other do- gooders, prepared a meal for a blind man. As soon as others turned their backs, this seeming good Samaritan, who was supposed to assist the blind man, went back to snatch the pot of soup and spoon from the blind man for himself. Again most of us Nigerians as spectators applauded. Under all sorts of excuses there was no shortage of partakers in the meal. And they were not troubled by the moral implications. The present government is challenged by overpowering issues of morality and ethics that it simply cannot wish away. Until it confronts these issues and deals with them, it will not be able to prepare the foundation and set the example that can move the nation forward. Few Nigerians are impressed by excuses being given for not doing what needs to be done. They see these excuses as self-serving, as grand deceit, and as cover-up. One man's own excuse was that &quot;all Nigerians are corrupt.&quot; I challenged hi,. Not all Nigerians are corrupt. If, however, you are corrupt and you attain high public office, you either purge yourself or you put your authority in question. For, if you do not atone for it, corruption becomes debilitating and disabling. No society that treats public fund and property with utter disregard and cares only for personal accumulation on the principle of &quot;steal and go&quot; can make progress in the closing decade of the twentieth century. We cannot extol corruption and hope for the grace of God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This present administration in an attempt to clothe itself with the garb of legitimacy and acceptance brought into its fold politicians of all shades of integrity most of whom were previously condemned and brought into disrepute by the same military men. One wonder whether these politicians have now been cleansed in the sea of Galilee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inconsistency and regular shifting of the goal post constituted the hallmarks of the Babangida's political chicanery of which Abacha was a part, we have now been told that the programme of this administration would last for an indefinite &quot;brief period&quot; which an insider told me could vary from one year to 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If a government out of lack of confidence in itself fails to repose confidence in us by telling us its programme and how long it requires to implement that programme, why should such a government ask for our confidence and understanding? And if it does, why should we give it? After all confidence begets confidence. And how seriously should anybody take the idea that the Constitutional Conference that has no hand in voting in the military government should determine its agenda. For us to take such idea seriously, the outcome or decision of the Constitutional Conference should be binding on the military government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Corruption on any scale is bad; so is mismanagement on any scale. But given the events of the past eight years, it is clear that the civilian politicians of the Second Republic were far less rapacious in their corruption compared to the military who succeeded them, and far less degenerate in their social and economic management. But the greatest danger that military governance poses to our polity is not the perpetuation of economic and social mismanagement, bad as this is . The greatest danger lies in the failure of the military to break the vicious cycle of succeeding itself. Unless Nigerians stand up against this trend, it may continue indefinitely. Invariably, our leaders have failed because we have allowed them to fail us. Those leaders of erstwhile leaders sit down and enjoy and laugh waiting for another opportunity. What a tragedy for a nation! Since independence, Nigeria has not been able to unite behind one non-military leader, I believe we can unite behind one political issue. It is democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1985 we were mesmerised with the debate on the IMF loan and later in 1986 with the Political Bureau debate. Most Nigerians, including those who set us on the IMF debate, understood little or nothing of the operations and policies of the IMF. In the end the two debates served the purpose they were meant to serve; to provide a diversion. Now, we are warming up to another diversion, and a more dangerous one called the Constitutional Conference. I will say more about this presently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, I would like to draw another parallel between the present administration and its predecessor in the use and abuse of the press. It is common knowledge that the last full military administration hired hack writers to mislead the public, assassinate the character of innocent persons and to create the impression which the government wanted, however misleading.  Editorials were sponsored and planted. These practices were acknowledge at the highest level of government. The present administration has embarked on the same method and the same practice, especially to justify and explain its inconsistencies as evidence that it is bowing to the wishes of the people.  The culture of settlement and payment of praise singers and writers enthroned by the last full military administration continues with little or no abatement. The politics of prebendalism has been raised to a higher height.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For as long as our leaders and sponsor of leaders lead and sponsor for personal, ethnic, geographical, sectional, religious and purely economic interests, for so long will the problems remain with us, no mater the sophistication of our constitution or the frequency of change. How do we provide a stake in Nigeria for every Nigerian if Nigerians from one part of the country can be told that God has ordained people from another part of Nigeria for permanent political leadership of Nigeria and the others for followership? I would not have made reference to this unfortunate statement but for the fact that the person ;to whom it was attributed could jolly well have been voted in as the president of this country. There has never been a disclaimer. But more importantly, no responsible voice from up-country has publicly made a statement that leadership material is not limited to only one particular section of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At this juncture, let me pay tribute to those who stood against the diabolical and destabilising role that Radio Kaduna played during the Babangida-created crisis of June/July/August last year. I do not listen to any Nigerian radio, let alone Radio Kaduna. But some of my northern friends who listened to Radio Kaduna alerted me and urged me to assist in giving hope, confidence and assurance of peace and security to Nigerians wherever they lived. It was the alert that partly made me call a press conference to urge Nigerians to remain calm in their places of abode and to assure them that the crisis would not lead to a civil war. Unfortunately some mass media in the south replied in king to Radio Kaduna. I say unfortunately because two wrongs don't make a right. But rather than Radio Kaduna which is paid from public funds being brought to order by the government, the media in the south that replied in kind were either banned or closed down. This was deliberately playing the north against the south for personal interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The settler/stranger syndrome aggravates the sense of belonging and stake in the country. It is pathetic and most lamentable that after forty years of residence in any part of Nigeria, a &quot;non-indigene&quot; is still regarded and still regards himself as an alien in that past of the country. Worse still ;are the institutional and procedural mechanisms that accentuate, amplify and reinforce such a feeling of alienation. I refer in particular to such instruments as discriminatory school fees, and appointments and promotions in the civil service, etc. It is important that we regard any Nigerian who has lived in a particular area for upwards of twenty years or who has been born into that area as qualified for all rights of an indigene of that area with all its obligations, responsibilities and duties. He should be free to participate fully and without discrimination in all political, economic and social activities of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a grand falsification and misperception going around that the presidential system is expensive and therefore we should opt again</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for the parliamentary system. The question is: expensive for what and for whom? The greatest advantage of the presidential system is that the country is the constituency of the president. He is obliged to know the country and to seek support across the country. Even if he is a tribal baron, his horizon and outlook will be broadened by the end of a nationwide campaign. In 1979, two of the presidential contestants confessed to me that the country-wide campaign tours provided a great education for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most interesting to watch is the compromise of principles by public office holders in Nigeria and those angling for public office. The situation is so bad that it now seems an aberration for anyone to resign from public office on matters of principle. During my time in government, I recall two specific individuals who offered to resign on principle. I also recall the celebrated resignation of the editor of the &quot;New Nigerian&quot; at the height of the political crisis last year. There are two or three who refuse to join a particular government on principle. These examples represent our oasis of hope in a desert of unprincipled men and women. I believe there may be more men of honour and integrity whose actions and reactions are unheralded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the muddle and insincerity of deciding to probe or not to probe, it appears that some form of selective probes are going on at almost all levels.  People are now wondering what is happening? Are there sacred cows or are we allowing camels to pass through the eye of the needle? Is this a case of nepotism, favouritism or is it enlightened self-interest? In a situation where fringe actors are being probed and principal actors are not probed, the public is bound to question the sincerity and the justice of the entire effort</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the economic costs of non-democratic practice in Nigeria in the past eight years the group self-aggrandisement and the wens of patron-client relations and politics of distribution which led to the clamour for a National Conference s a means of redressing the past and preventing a re-occurrence. The government is offering a Constitutional Conference instead. Some expect to emerge from the National Conference new local governments while others expect new states and yet others expect to life oil for expected new Ogoni State. Ogoni is symbolic of most minorities' plight and thinking all over the country. No matter how we perceive their claim, it is an issue that must be put on the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are many Ogonis, our dispensation must allow for the right of minorities including the enjoyment of part of the God-given resources in their area and there must be a delicate balance between the rights and interests of the minorities and the rights and common interests of all Nigerians. We must listen to them. I was told that the purpose of the conference is to satisfy the agitators, but should we address such a basic and vital issue as the constitution of a nation on the premise of satisfying a handful or agitators? The conference might get out of control. And if I may ask, &quot;What is wrong with the 1979 Constitution and the 1989 Constitution?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is need for a general re-examination of all aspects of our national life; education, health, agricultural, industrialization, public administration, law and order and security, and judiciary etc. and what tier of government will be responsible and be involved for what ends and with what means. If, therefore, there is going to be a conference, it must be a conference to examine each and all of these issues. A Constitutional Conference to keep all agitators quiet, no matter how much it is dressed up, cannot achieve the objective of a genuine National Conference designed to examine critically the political and other essential areas of our lives on which there must be a consensus for effective government action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the atomisation of Nigeria by means of state creation almost to the point of rendering the constituent unites prostate, I find the concept of zones as the basis of our federation worth examining. At this stage of our development, we cannot abandon the federal system but perhaps the federating units should be enough to be viable, and made up of local governments. We may be able to save some costs on administration for development. The time has also come when as a mark of true federalism, revenue resources and responsibility of each constituent component, should determine wages and salary scales of each constituent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I hereby declare once again that I cannot and will never be a party to the breaking up of Nigeria. Let me also reiterate what I have said before; I have had to fight a war to keep Nigeria together, I cannot and will not fight another war to tear Nigeria apart. However, I still believe that a major issue to be settled at the conference should be the issue of our living together -- the corporate existence of Nigeria. We must settle this matter once and for all and do away with constant threats to our corporate existence. After we have agreed to live together, we an settle the issue of how we will live together. I am convinced that when we are confronted with the reality of a break-up, our leaders will prefer living together on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit to breaking up. If our leaders cannot appreciate the need and the necessity, our people can and they will give the final verdict. These issues should be dealt with once and for all and most democratically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forum for dealing with this matter, as I see it, is a National Conference. A Constitutional Conference can deal with a number of relevant issues, but it will remain somewhat limiting. We have not had a Constitutional Conference since independence but since we have agreed that there is need for a Conference, let us make it one that will deal comprehensively with the fundamental issues of Nigerian existence. What our situation demands is a National Conference by elected representatives of the people in Nigeria to discuss all major issues, subject to one condition that whatever is agreed must be referred to a national referendum. If we opt for a genuine National Conference that will examine all aspects of our national life, it may last longer than one year. The time-table of the present military administration should, therefore, not be contingent on the result of the Conference since the final outcome will go before a referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At this point let me report that on my way to Kaduna yesterday I was invited to Abuja. My discussion with the head of state centred essentially on the national constitutional conference. My feeling or should I say my deduction is that most of the points I have raised in his address on the conference are begin seriously considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The economy requires a big dose of discipline, reduction of corruption from the highest to the lowest, motivation, commitment, rationalisation and reduction of waste. No plea to our creditors for compassion, concession and relief will be heeded until some correctness is brought into our political and economic practice and management. We cannot maintain a high debt service ratio, decline in oil revenue, profligacy in spending, continuous capital flight and no foreign investment and then expect wonderful performance of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manipulation of the judiciary in a way that undermined its credibility, independence and effectiveness is one of the greatest disservice of the last full ;military administration to the county. To destroy the judiciary must remain sacred. It is in the best interest of the people to ensure this, otherwise there will be no honest and credible arbiter between citizens ad between the citizens and the government especially a government that is full of mischief. The judiciary also needs to save itself and enhance its worth, by jealously guarding its independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evil is not reformable, it must be removed. And that was what happened to the last full military administration. Although the present administration learned a lot from its teacher, it has not yet completely turned evil. But the trends and the tendencies are obvious. It is the responsibility of all Nigerians to prevent another government from becoming completely evil. We can embark on the process of democracy today with the establishment of a non-military national government that has the credibility and the moral strength to tackle the contending political, economic and social issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We must never be tired of demanding that any government should chasten itself and give us the foundation and the example to propel us forward. We must demand that any government should deal honestly with us and level up with us. We must have the programme ad the time-table of any government to be able to assess its performance. We must be accountability and transparency that we are not getting now. If any administration is turning evil we should spare no efforts or no sacrifice to remove it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria has a responsibility to the whole black race to put its house in order and show that the race is not doomed. We cannot afford to fail because of our responsibility to ourselves, the rest of Africa and the black world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAILY OBSERVER, Thursday, February 3, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The American Ambassador to The Gambia, Mr. Andrew Winter, says he feels &quot;strongly&quot; that the time has not yet come for the establishment of a university in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Winter gave his views on education in The Gambia during an extensive interview with Daily Observer journalists yesterday, when he visited the Observer offices at the invitation of Mr. Kenneth Y. Best, the managing director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The costs of setting up and running a university are extraordinarily high. That same money could be better spent on improving basic education in this country, and technical education,&quot; Mr. Winter believes. He added that the money left over (which would be far less than a university would cost) could be sent on training Gambian students abroad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't think the time has come; in an area where you have to pick and choose, I think the emphasis has to be on the basics,&quot; Mr. Winter stressed. He said that high schools should be improved, so that students could compete for overseas scholarships. He stated that the university in Sierra Leone was &quot;half-empty,&quot; and he was sure The Gambia could &quot;get a good deal&quot; in making arrangements for some more of its students to obtain higher education there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Yes, you need education for development,&quot; he declared, &quot; but for the initial stages of development you need a work force with basic technical skills. Lawyers can be trained outside this country -- doctors, too -- but it's a lot harder to train mechanics or offset press experts, or whatever it may be, outside the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked about the US government's provision for educational scholarships, he said he did not know the full amount involved, but he thought the US has been supporting Gambian students &quot;fairly well.&quot; Enjoying Gambia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Winter said he has enjoyed his first four months here. He said coming to work in The Gambia is &quot;the easiest adjustment I have ever made.&quot; He spoke approvingly of his own embassy staff, and of USAID and Peace Corps personnel here. The ambassador went on to say that in The Gambia &quot;people are willing to talk,&quot; he can travel freely, and there are &quot;very few frustrations.&quot; He said the greatest satisfaction in his job is that he feels he can make an impact. The Gambia, Mr. Winter said, has a government that listens, that does its best for the country, and that has the right kind of policies (for example, in encouraging private enterprise). He said his posting here &quot;couldn't be better,&quot; because the Gambian and US governments enjoy shared values, especially a commitment to and respect foe human rights.  9M Aid Withheld</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talking about the D9m in US government aid that has been withheld,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Winter said: &quot;The important thing to realise here is that the target of the sum was set jointly by the government of the United States and the government of The Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government of The Gambia agreed they would attempt to collect a certain amount of money under the AMRC's auspices by December 31, 1993. For a variety of reasons, the government has not been able to meet that target. We shall continue to work with the government and support the government in its efforts to meet the target.&quot; He added the government has made tremendous efforts to collect the money, but the rule of law must apply, and citizens have a right to pursue all legal means in their own defence. US Fund Not Misused</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ambassador said he was not aware that any US aid funds have been misused, in The Gambia or elsewhere. There are very stringent controls.  Gambia's Future</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked about what future he thought The Gambia could look forward to, Ambassador Winter said that on the positive side are the democracy and freedom this country enjoys, and its present emphasis on private enterprise.  The less positive aspects include the country's small size and its lack of a natural resource base. Becoming an African &quot;Singapore&quot; is a long-term goal.  Until the education provision has been enhanced, and until sub-regional, regional and all African trade and freedom movements are enlarged, the process will be long and slow. He praised The Gambia for making sacrifices &quot;almost as no other country&quot; in respect of realistic development policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the CFA zone has made its own adjustment much later, and therefore the pain of adjustment for them is greater. Russia, he added, seems to be backing away from essential economic reforms. The greatest hope for The Gambia is that its government and people have made the right decisions.  Tourism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ambassador Winter, turning to the tourist industry, said it is necessary to get tourists to spend more money here. This means considering going more &quot;up scale,&quot; and encouraging eco-tourism. He had been impressed during his visit to Kiang West, and said there is scope for the type of tourist who likes bird-watching and nature generally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> USAID intends to help artisans sell their work. The Gambia could possibly very fruitfully liaise with Senegal in developing facilities that will attract more US citizens, including African-Americans, to make the long journey here. Visas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Replying to a question about the issuing if visas at the US embassy, the ambassador said there is absolutely no quota. If the applicant can satisfy the US consul that he is a bona fide tourist, businessman or student, he will be given a visa. He gave an assurance that there is no passing-on of information concerning visa applicants to other local embassies and high commissions. Press Freedom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the press, the ambassador said he and his government are utterly committed to a free press as part of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said sometimes governments are sensitive to press criticism, and they have the right to criticise the press themselves, provided they do not attack or threaten it. He added the press should be honest, and responsible, and not undermine confidence in a government that is doing its best. He added that he considers the Gambia press is, in general, very responsible. US Foreign Policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On US foreign policy generally, Ambassador Winter admitted that during the cold war period, American governments had sometimes put their desire to combat communism above their wish to further the cause of democracy. This meant, for example, that at one time the US &quot;saw advantage in backing people who did not share our democratic principles.&quot; But he said that, at the present time the US has made it clear that in Zaire, for example, Mobutu is part of the country's problem, and until he goes, the problem cannot be solved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He agreed with his compatriot, Professor Harris, who gave a lecture here last week, that ultimately each country must take responsibility for its own destiny. South Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ambassador Winter spoke very warmly of his optimism for the future of South Africa, in which he spent three and a half years. (He added that he has visited some 32 other African countries.) During his time there he felt genuinely &quot;part of history.&quot; He had not understood before the basic lack of hatred between blacks and whites. He said that although the blacks, as symbolised by Mandela, have suffered every possible sort of deprivation and humiliation, they are now intent on working to introduce a multi-racial democracy. &quot;There is no other alternative for South Africa,&quot; the ambassador stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Winter said that following the inauguration of democratic rule, euphoria will gave way to realism, as the country experiences the realities of the economic situation. But he remained hopeful, given the inspirational leadership of de Klerk and the &quot;even greater&quot; inspirational role of Mandela, that South Africa's formidable problems will be solved. The US government has been &quot;quietly talking to both sides&quot; for seven or eight years, but South Africa will not benefit from outside interference. &quot;Ultimately its problems must be worked out between its own peoples.&quot; Nigeria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Winter said the US is very concerned about Nigeria, and &quot;strongly wants to see the return of democratic rule.&quot; He said he is not optimistic, in the short term; on the other hand, &quot;democracy is the 'in- thing' everywhere, now, and democracy will come, sooner or later.&quot; Middle East</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On US support for arms in the Middle East, the ambassador said ultimately every government looks after what it perceives to be its country's own self interest and the US seeks to create a balance of power by enabling its friends to defend themselves. But he said there has been very real progress in the relationships between Israel, the PLO, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. Clinton's Priorities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Winter said President Clinton plans to concentrate on US domestic affairs, which he (like the ambassador himself) feels have been ignored for too long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that as a &quot;child of the sixties&quot; in high school and university, he had experienced at first hand the struggles of African- Americans, and much has been accomplished, socially and in terms of legislation. But there is a great deal more to be done. Under President Clinton, the ambassador claimed, &quot;some dreams have been revived.&quot; He went on that it would be insincere not to admit that black Americans are still disadvantaged in terms of their poverty, and limited access to education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The odds are still against them.&quot; The US government is doing more to help, and such programmes as the effort to provide universal health care for all, and short-term welfare schemes are very promising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Andrew Winter concluded that everyone strives to achieve &quot;self worth,&quot; and that no-one can make a fortune on welfare handouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ambassador visited all departments of The Observer Press Limited, and was introduced to staff by the managing director.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOUTH, February 11-15, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's real talent lies in the non-governmental organisation (NGO) sector and there should be more of it in the new bureaucracy, according to Prof Merlyn Mehl, education director of the Independent Development Trust (IDT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most NGOs have spent the past two years rethinking their positions and many have concluded that, to survive after the elections, they have to provide improved service and reach agreement with the government, Mehl said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state at present suffers not only from a lack of legitimacy, but also from a lack of effectiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Governments by and large are very inept,&quot; Mehl said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While the NGO sector responded to a lack on the part of the government, its existence demonstrates not only its viability to discuss social issues but also the need for such a sector.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Some of them are worth surviving, some will mercifully, disappear into oblivion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mehl said the NGO sector was already a surrogate bureaucracy, and had developed a high degree of innovativeness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NGOs have had to find ways of doing things differently to the government. They could not be more of the same and this tended to be programme-centred, Mehl explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For example, the Department of Education and Training;s Inset programme run by 600 subject advisors amounts to R600 million a year,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Governments respond to problems by appointing people. NGOs create a programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NGOs were also lean and thin, but the only reason was that they did not have any money. An analysis of major NGOs in education shows salaries are 50 percent of their annual budgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state, on the other hand, spends 85 percent of its budget -- amounting to R23 billion -- on salaries and administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no leeway for creativity among state employees, people are more concerned about their pensions,&quot; Mehl said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the future, some people in NGOs will be absorbed into a future legitimate authority, as was done in Namibia. NGOs could also have a restructured relationship with the democratic state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Governments cannot and should no do everything for citizens. They have a tendency to do for and not with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The NGO sector must survive, because they really represent the variety and ability of th people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interfund, a major foreign funding organisation representing European and Canadian governments in South Africa, said it would co- operate in some way with a democratic government in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interfund director Mr. Barry Smith said he did not believe the future South African government was going to absorb all the NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They might take up a lot of skilled people in organisations. And even if these people are committed to the NGO sector they may feel obliged to go to government because there are better opportunities for advancement in the new civil service,&quot; Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This could drain the NGO and community-based organisation (CBO) sector. NGOs are less vulnerable because they have a bigger pool of trained people. CBOs will be affected insofar as their leadership could be drawn into local government structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The sector will survive, but it will be a rocky road for a while.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smith said organisations need to analyse honestly what their role in the future will be -- whether they will work outside of government structures until they are absorbed and run by government or whether they will remain independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some -- like literacy organisations -- could work in integrated government programmes where there is a need for a strong government programme and use public money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Organisations need to ask whether there are really for remaining independent, whether their mission is to play a lobbying function, influencing policy,&quot; Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He warned that there were a lot more actors who would like to be involved in South Africa and could be in the future. There will be bilateral government-to-government projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank, western governments and the business community would also be involved at some level. This did not mean all would invest in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kagiso Trust director Mr. Eric Molobi said state intervention would not happen overnight as the transitional government would remain an area of contest for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There will be a transitional period where NGO activity will become more intense as people who come into government realise that the bureaucracy blocks them and they will not be able to do anything because the bureaucracy is hostile,&quot; Molobi predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But when we say NGOs will do the work, we're not talking about the small projects activists work in, we're talking about bodies like the National Housing Forum, the National Electricity Forum. Although it is not a government body, the NHF can must R1,2 billion -- it can do development with impact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Molobi also warned against South Africans allowing outside agencies to dictate development policy in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My limited experience of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund already shows me that if you allow them to come into your country with their own package, they nail you,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The only way we can circumvent that is if we draw up the package ourselves and go to them and say this is what we want to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We may not reach that stage. The main players among political organisations' leadership today are concentrating their efforts on struggling for power and only that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And I know that after we enjoy the celebrations after the elections, the first thing on the agenda of the government will be development and we will have no real plans and will have to go to the World Bank on our knees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Molobi said after elections, the European Community (EC), which channels funds into South Africa through Kagiso Trust, might change the emphasis of where it puts the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of it may go to a democratic government and a section may remain with NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Whether this will happen is difficult to predict. One has to observe trends in African and other parts of the world,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are hoping governments will not cut their money to South Africa after the elections, but merely the slice of the cake South Africa gets. The money can be deployed to other activities likes education and health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Kagiso Trust will be here for the long haul. We had discussions with the EC and secured this. The organisation will definitely not be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thrown out after there is a new government.&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Johannesburg consultant who performs assessments of NGOs for foreign funders said a major short-coming in NGOs is skills training and the transfer of skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Affirmative action programmes are virtually non-existent. Black women in the leadership of NGOs and other funded structures are rare. Most are controlled by Indian and white men and a few white women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If these people left the organisation to work for the new government, it could only strengthen the affirmative action programmes, she argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They did not put enough effort into working out how to transfer skills and there are no signs that this vacuum is begin filled,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Funders are desperate for affirmative action programmes and this is not something that just happens, people have to plan for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Many argue that they can either be professional or have affirmative action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said there were people in NGOs who want to make a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many at top level don't want to touch government which they see as an under-resourced nightmare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is much easier to be a watchdog than a civil servant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This could sharpen the problem of white-led NGOs and create conflict.  People will perceive the watchdog organisation as racist which are opposed to the black-led government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consultant said many senior people in organisations assumed in the past that they would naturally form part of the new government but are rapidly changing their tune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Civics are a case in point. They are no longer local governments in waiting. The issues are not so simple any more. People are beginning to realise that local interests will conflict with national interest in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOUTH, February 4-8, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) tend to be much too dependent on external funds, funding organisations complain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of them are also out of step with the new strategy of development work being promoted by funding agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government is setting up various bodies and structures to look into and deal with development. The business sector is investigating ways of radically widening its corporate social responsibility programmes to take account of development issues. But NGOs are still convinced they deserve support on the basis of &quot;anti-apartheid&quot; work.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within the democratic movement there are few people with the necessary skills and experience related to public and development management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the first time, funders are dictating the terms to organisations in South Africa, sometimes openly scathing of their ability to produce the goods the funds are earmarked for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We look at the process -- any project must be sellable and rooted in the community., They must have discussed it and be prepared to participate in it,&quot; explained Kagiso Trust director Mr. Eric Molobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kagiso expects professional planning and reporting from the projects they fund today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Molobi said the people complaining about this are those who ;used to get money very easily without necessarily reporting on how it was spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many organisations complain that funders expect them to quantify and they are not able to do so. But the funders know exactly how to do this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kagiso conducted an exercise with literacy groups. They took the amount of money they got a year and divided it with the number of people they reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They found literacy groups spent more a head than the first year fees of a university student.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And when we ask where are the people you trained, what are they doing with their skills, they can't supply the information,&quot; Molobi complained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are no longer only doing financial audits, we are conducting performance audits as well, For the amount of Rands a project gets, they must be able to show how many people they have reached. &quot;When we tell people we can no longer fund them because they aren't doing well enough, they get angry, we are labelled bureaucrats and accused of being co-opted by mainstream organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But these people forget one thing: when they send us their proposals, it is ratified by our board. We are accountable to our donors, in turn, and they keep reminding us that we are receiving taxpayers' money and they need proper reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am caught in-between. If I satisfy the old activist mentality then I am going to sacrifice my career and Kagiso will not be able to continue as a development agency. A number of proposals we receive are rubbish in development terms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. David Bonbright, executive director of the Development Resources Centre, said he believed the challenge for NGOs was to maintain their voluntary character while becoming increasingly effective in their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They must avoid becoming aid bureaucracies while commanding greater resources and becoming more effective institutional players alongside other key actors such as government and companies,&quot; Bonbright said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They must be professional who remain completely answerable to the amateurs they are meant to serve, while simultaneously satisfying their donor paymasters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bonbright said the task of managing an NGO was much more difficult than either public sector or for-profit management. They must resist the temptation to import uncritically management lessons from those other sectors to the non-profit framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While NGO management was challenging, effective donor support for NGOs was equally so, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some grant funds that made a project possible often breed a crippling dependency into the NGO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It takes great skill and experience for donors to provide funding in ways that actually increase the capacities of the NGO partners to thrive without then,&quot; Bonbright said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In South Africa I find little evidence that these two propositions are heeded seriously be either NGOs or donors. If they were, we would see greater thought and resources begin applied to strengthening institutional capacities among NGOs and donors alike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said NGOs should give more attention to basic organisational skills like bookkeeping, filing systems and planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They should also use existing resource bases like their staff, governing board, funders, NGO partners, professional advisers and volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With respect to the especially fraught issue of financial resources, NGOs must become much more creative in diversifying their sources of funding to the widest possible spectrum, including institutional donors, individual citizens, community fundraising events, in-kind support from companies and, where appropriate, income generation,&quot; Bonbright said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My experience with ordinary NGOs indicates a growing awareness among them of the need to strengthen institutional capacities in theses ways. There is even the beginning of the emergence of specialist NGOs dedicated to building institutional capacity of other NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Here donors have an important role to play. I would like to suggest that at least five percent of the donor's budget should be spent on activities specifically designed to improve the effectiveness of the remaining 95 percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bonbright said he was dismayed by the almost complete lack of organised efforts to improve the effectiveness and professionalism of donor institutions in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I cannot say why this is so, although it may have something to do with the simple fact that professional philanthropy in South Africa, including corporate social investment, is a young profession,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We could organise learning and exchange opportunities that allow donors to compare their experiences with each other and with international experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Secondly, we can organise similar learning and exchange opportunities, but for donors and NGOs together. Through such sessions they may gain deeper understanding of their respective decision-making processes, become generally more transparent to each other, and give greater meaning to the notion of a &quot;partnership&quot; between donors and NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Thirdly, and most controversially, we could work towards an open public discourse about the ways and means of financing development in South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bonbright said the historical secrecy around funding, while understandable in an undemocratic era of political repression of NGOs, made it almost impossible to build strong, independent development organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And while one can sympathise with the reluctance of donors and NGOs to expose themselves to public criticism and debate about the appropriateness and quality of their humanitarian efforts, the wider public interest is best served by the rigorous and broad accountability of the humanitarians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Barry Smith, of Interfund, argues funders have not really changed their demands on NGOs. They had always required clear information from projects about their performance and results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What has changed is that there is a larger profile of donor organisations in South Africa and many now engage in regular discussion with their partners,&quot; Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When we were based outside South Africa, this relationship was very constrained. Now we have all had a healthy dose of reality about some organisations and are accused of being bureaucratic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few years ago, the environment in South Africa was very unfriendly to this kind of relationship, Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Interfund required proper accounting for funds in the past, they made allowances for the constraints people worked under -- the harassment and the atmosphere in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now their partners have changed from crisis-driven projects and overt political work to full-time socio-economic development, and Interfund believes private sector standards of policy, initiative and the provision of services can be replicated by organisations in the NGO sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rhetoric and goals of an orgnisation laid out in funding proposals has to translate into reality for the people who count -- the target group identified as the beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We understand that it is very difficult for organisations to make this shift quickly, particularly those who are deprived of access to training resources -- the kind of things that are readily available to NGOs in countries which are less politically troubled, Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;So we are not only making demands. In a limited way, we are trying to gind ways of supporting the development of structures and skills in organisations to allow them to be more productive and analytical about what goals and end products are.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TELL, The Weekly Newsmagazine, No. 9, February 28, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hopes of some Nigerians eager to debate the nation's political future as soon as possible may once again have been dashed for now. In a repeat of ex-president Ibrahim Babangida's usual way of reneging on his promise whilst in power, the proposed National Constitutional Conference supposedly scheduled to kick off in the first quarter of this year may have been postponed &quot;tacitly&quot; by the Abacha government, through the coordinating body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, the National Constitutional Conference Commission, NCCC, which forwarded its recommendation on modalities for the proposed conference gave the indication. The commission's decision not to recommend any specific date for the commencement of the talks has heightened fears that it may even eventually be aborted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, government has consistently assured Nigerians that the talks will not be delayed. The commission rested its argument on some excuses among which are time to &quot;fine tune all kinds of logistics&quot; for the conference.  Those logistics according to Walter Ofonagoro, the commission's publicity and organising committee chairman, include accommodation, feeding and transport arrangements for participants. But political watchers who have been sceptical of this regime's sincerity to organise a Sovereign National Conference, may have been thinking that the government's plan on the talks is a bundle of contradictions and a ruse if the inconsistency in this government's statements is anything to go by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Segun Jegede, administrative secretary of the Committee for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence of Human Rights, CDHR, during an interview with TELL said that: &quot;IBB and Abacha's regimes are the same.&quot; &quot;What the human rights organisation will do is to present the catalogue of Abacha's treacheries to the whole world,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NCCC according to reports included in their recommendation that 75 per cent of conferees will be elected on the basis of senatorial representation while the remaining 25 per cent will be selected based on professional and interest groups. Such groups are traditional rulers, labour, students and human rights activists. The NCCC was set up mid- January to work out modalities for the national conference aimed at solving the recurring issue of national questions and usher in an enduring democracy. Those national questions are revenue allocation, oil exploitation and minority problem among others. The commission, also recommended the use of the celebrated Option A4 used for the annulled June 12 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ordinarily, there has been speculation of late that the northern power-brokers are putting pressure on the government to drop the idea of the national conference because of the gear of losing grip on the country's leadership. But the trend of events coupled with the inconsistent policy statements of th government, may have begun to prove sceptics rights. This is equally possible on the suspicion that the government may tinker with the NCCC recommendations and flood the conference with its lackeys just like when IBB doctored the Assembly's recommendations and draft. Perhaps.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFRICA NEWS SERVICE, Lagos, Nigeria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With world attention focused on Bosnia, an international effort to end an equally destructive conflict in Africa is threatened with collapse. West African governments, which have mounted an unprecedented regional peacemaking effort in Liberia, are warning that they can no longer afford to maintain their 19,000-strong multilateral force without increased international help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria and its African neighbors have spent an estimated half billion dollars on the Liberian operation, which is one of the largest peacekeeping efforts in the world and the only major one not run by the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than four years of fighting in Liberia have claimed at least 150,000 lives and displaced over two million people. The conflict has created a refugee crisis throughout West Africa, and fighting has spilled into neighboring countries, particularly Sierra Leone. Renewed skirmishes in recent weeks have inflicted additional casualties and sent 10,000 more Liberians fleeing for safety.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, the World Food Program issued an appeal for stepped-up relief to Liberia, saying &quot;there is still a large and desperate need for emergency assistance.&quot; A situation report issued on Thursday by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance says continuation of the conflict &quot;has increased susceptibility to disease, caused rates of malnutrition to rise precipitously, and decreased the capacity of the rural population to participate in heavy agricultural labor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent meetings with two visiting leaders from neighboring states, the Nigerian head of state, General Sani Abacha, declared that the financially strapped countries of this region cannot continue to use up their &quot;vital resources&quot; in Liberia when each is facing so many pressing domestic needs. Nigeria has the largest contingent in the peace force that was sent to Liberia in 1990 by the 16-member Economic Community of West African States, known as Ecowas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana, another principal participant in the peace force, has served notice that its troops may be withdrawn from Liberia in a month unless prospects for a lasting settlement improve.  Ecowas leaders are planning an emergency summit within the next few weeks to reassess their Liberian involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1990 West African intervention successfully separated warring Liberian factions and ended wholesale killing in the capital, Monrovia. But periodic outbursts of fighting in the countryside have blocked attempts to reunite the nation and rebuild its devastated infrastructure. Continuing disagreements have delayed the peace process and raised the costs of both peacekeeping and humanitarian aid.  The U.S. outlay alone on humanitarian aid since 1990 has now risen beyond $320 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new round of intense negotiations earlier this month broke the latest impasse among the three principal Liberian factions -- the interim government in Monrovia headed by Amos Sawyer, the rebel movement known as the Patriotic Front led by Charles Taylor, and a militia of former government soldiers called Ulimo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parties have set March 7 as the beginning of a six-month transition leading to elections in September.  On that day, disarmament is to begin and a new interim administration is to take charge of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agreement was announced a week after the first visit to Liberia by a senior Clinton administration official, Assistant Secretary of State George Moose, who warned that any additional delays would result in reduced U.S.  support for the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a concession to Taylor, whose relationship with the West Africans has been rocky since the start, the peacekeeping force has added troops from African countries outside the region.  As a further confidence builder, a small United Nations observer mission has been created to monitor the cease-fire and the elections. Some 800 soldiers from Tanzania and a slightly larger number from Uganda have joined the peace keepers in recent weeks, and about 360 UN military observers currently are taking up positions throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, after a lengthy interagency debate, the Clinton administration agreed to provide $30.8 million to underwrite the deployment of the new troops, including $19.8 million for the a trust fund established by the United Nations to pay for the troops and for the disarmament and election efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a number of obstacles remain. The scheduled dispatch of troops from Zimbabwe has been delayed indefinitely by a disagreement with the UN over how much Zimbabwe should be paid to offset its costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The entire UN effort in Liberia is seriously underfunded, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in a report to the Security Council last week.  While the U.S. contribution has made possible the deployment of the new troops, he said, there is no money to pay stipends for these soldiers and no money to offset the financial burden West African governments have carried alone for more than three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The West Africans are &quot;facing difficulties in their own logistical support&quot; for their troops, and the peace effort is &quot;taxing the budgets of the contributing countries,&quot; the secretary general said. A similar warning was issued by the Nigerian commander of the West African force, Major-General John Inienger. The troops, which are expected to carry out a major disarmament operation, are working without such vital equipment as communications gear, and much of what they are using is obsolete, Inienger said in Monrovia last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each of the West African participants in the peacekeeping force faces major problems at home. Ghana, for example, is struggling with an unexpected humanitarian disaster in the north of the country where competition for land suddenly erupted early this month into serious ethnic fighting. The government has dispatched troops to stop the killing, which left more than 1000 people dead, and is mobilizing food and housing for some 20,000 people forced to flee their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the military government in Nigeria, which is trying to weather its own political storms, the country's role in the Ecowas peace effort is becoming increasingly controversial. General Abacha took power in November, ousting an unelected transitional government that was installed after President Ibrahim Babangida annulled the June 12 elections his military government had organized and overseen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although a close Babangida associate, Abacha has tried to distance himself from his unpopular predecessor by appointing a largely civilian cabinet, many of whom are former anti-government activists, and by tilting his economic policies in a populist direction. But he has been unable to stop Nigeria's plunge into its worst economic slump in years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The political and economic crisis has made Liberia a sensitive issue in Nigeria, which has borne most of the cost of the peacekeeping operation.  Prior to the establishment of the UN mission late last year, the only significant outside assistance for the West African effort was a $29 million U.S. contribution to Ecowas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are no official figures on what Nigeria has spent to pay the troops, maintain a small air force and operate various other facilities, including a radio transmitter in Monrovia. Most of the outlay is believed to have come from a portion of government oil revenue that has remained off the official books and thus uncounted by the international financial institutions which hold Nigeria's mounting $30 billion foreign debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One newspaper columnist, writing in the National Concord last week, referred to Liberia as Nigeria's &quot;Vietnam&quot; and said the &quot;consequences&quot; of the peace effort for the country's &quot;wobbling national economy&quot; are too great any longer to bear. Another prominent editorialist, the Guardian's Cecilia Anthony-Williams, called for a &quot;free debate on Nigeria's military adventures&quot; and said it was time for Nigerians to stop allowing &quot;military bosses to shed the blood of our soldiers in Liberia.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, February 22-25, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More Time is a new, and thrilling AIDS movie. It is a story about teenage love-mesh. It casts a real life situation of teenagers plunging in to the mysteries of love and relationships at the golden age of 15 to 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More Time, made in Zimbabwe with a Zimbabwean cast and crew revolves around 15 year old Thandi who is as adventurous as her age can allow. Thandi is not a village belle, but she is certainly striking and is a good netballer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She has dimples and a gap in her upper teeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She is ripe for any man to dare make passes, but she is also flirting with womanhood and township beckons. Thandi joins a group of rowdy school girls who lure her into the life of booze and sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two girls have a match-make for Thandi. And guess who it is. The sexy athletics hero, David, who is the envy of all the beauties at school. He is fondly referred to as &quot;Mr. Magic&quot; -- which is why he swept Thandi off her feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not surprising therefore that Thandi is involved in fights with other girls over David. She is so infatuated that the sight of any other girl near David makes her raving mad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But she has one problem. Thandi's kid brother is a pain in her neck.  He monitors her moves and reports on her to her parents. They have started noticing the change in her and when reports of her fights reach them, they are more than broken hearted and mad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But David's looks are also his un-making. His first girl Pamela with whom he has a baby has got AIDS. She got it from a certain 'uncle' who used to give her rides in his car. Her child died a few months later and David highly suspects he has got it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So when he falls and bleeds during one of the school competitions, he cautions Thandi who had run to help him not to touch his blood. This however does not stop him from running Thandi. He wants to have sex with her.  Thandi's two friends are also pushing them together and one of them even takes her to a drug shop for condoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thandi is ready for everything and starts meeting David at night.  Everything changed when they left with her family for a visit to the village during the holidays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thandi sees an AIDS patient and her grandmother tells her about it, a thing that her parents had feared to tell her. She is more careful when she comes back to the city life. When her mother finally finds the condoms in her bedside drawer, she picks the courage to tell her daughter about AIDS and marriage. Thandi is now more knowledgeable about AIDS than ever before and when she next meets David she tells him bluntly, &quot;David I want to live my life, I want more time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite his pleas that they will use condoms, Thandi sticks to her funs and because David was in love, he promises not to force her into anything. She agrees to a date for a dance and David says he also needs more time to know her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More Time is a classic AIDS movie that will go a long way in educating the youths and parents about the deadly disease. It is not just about the don'ts that parents keep pushing down the throats of their children without explanations. It is about the self-realisation and discovery of the truth after both the dos and don'ts have been put before you at the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you've watched Consequences, you will certainly love More Time by the same producers. It is a 90 minutes movie which has been donated to the AIDS Information Centre in Uganda to help fight AIDS among the teenagers and Youth. The Director of World Learning Inc. (Uganda), Mr. William Salmond, says the movie will be shown at the National Theatre beginning February 28 and will run for four weeks. Special concessions will be given to students but the official fee will be Shs 1,100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The movie is ideal for both children and adults and will make parents discuss the subject more freely and frankly with their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is produced by the Media For Development Trust in Zimbabwe with support from National AIDS Control Programmes of Zimbabwe and Botswana, DANIDA, CIDA, SIDA and NORAD.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, February 25 - March 1, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Was has broken out again in northern Uganda. Rebel leader Joseph Kony with his Lord's Resistance Army has elected to bring another round of deaths and great suffering to the people of Acholi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kony started fighting the NRM government way back in 1987. Late last year, he was reported to have renounced war as a means of solving problems.  He followed this up by accepting to hold direct peace talks with government.  Mrs. Betty Bigombe, Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office and in charge of the Pacification of the North, made several trips to the forests to talk peace with the s-called Lord's Army.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The whole country was happy with Betty's courageous efforts and Kony's positive attitude. Ugandans were all looking forward to the D-day of Kony's coming out of the bush. Indeed when President Yoweri Museveni temporarily moved his headquarters to Gulu three weeks ago, many people thought he had gone there to welcome Kony and his group and to re-assure him of government's firm commitment to peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was not to be. There was a sharp turn of events about ten days ago. Like a bolt out of the blue came Museveni's shocking ultimatum to Kony.  Negotiations had collapsed because the rebels reportedly wanted a further five to six months before they could finally come out of the bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni could not take it. So he issued the ultimatum giving them only seven days, from February 12 to surrender or face the might of the NRA.  Kony threw back the challenge immediately. He resumed the war on February 18, a day before the expiry of the ultimatum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is disturbing is why the negotiations failed at the last minute.  All peace loving Ugandans would be interested to know from both parties, but particularly from Government, why the peace talks collapsed so suddenly. This country has had enough war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is disheartening to hear that while the talks were going on, Kony's army was allegedly receiving military hardware from the Sudanese government.  It is alleged that their biggest consignment came from the arms the Sudanese army captured from the SPLA-Garang (the faction of the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army led by John Garang) in Tollit. We hope Kony has not let himself to be used by foreign forces to destroy his own country. That would be treason, not just rebellion against a government one does not like which could be legitimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to all this, NRA is said to have sent more troops to Acholi-land, armed to the teeth and ready for total war. It is a pity that some Acholi politicians are not particularly bothered by this sad development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even if war has broken out again, Mrs. Bigombe should not give up.  Both sides still appreciate the good work she has done to bring back peace in the north. This is important, especially as the rebels single her out as one of the few Acholi politicians who are not warmongers and whom they can still talk to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni should still allow the Minister to maintain contacts with the rebels. The war will not solve the problem. It has failed before, for seven good years, and it is bound to fail again. The only; sensible route to take is one of peace talks. Both parties should follow the route of give and take in the true spirit of tolerance and brotherhood.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, February 1-4, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaign to restore the kingdoms which saw the coronation of King Ronnie Mutebi as the 36th Kabaka of Buganda last July 31 was a major departure in Ugandan politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the first time in nearly 24 years, what would six years ago have been pooh poohed as a tribal demand, became a respectable national issue. It was as if the gods were punishing the NRM. The political philosophy of the NRM, among that of all past governments, is the one which views such demands as &quot;primitive and backward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet it was to be the government to whom they duty would fall to persuade the country that the restoration of kingdoms (as cultural institutions) was a positive and unifying thing (see &quot;Uganda's politics in a July twist,&quot; Ear to the Ground, last Tuesday).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The restoration and the drama which surrounded the Mutebi coronation partly made &quot;tribal&quot; demands by other communities respectable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The changes this has wrought in the last six months have been tremendous. Many NRM people, instead of championing &quot;revolution&quot; of the masses (peasant s and workers) &quot;against the IMF and its neo-colonialist policies&quot; are the spokespeople for these &quot;tribal demands.&quot; And they are not preaching class struggle in their campaigns to be elected to the Constituent Assembly; they are bribing voters with booze, and turning out with their &quot;supporters&quot; in convoys of a thousand bicycles decorated with branches like chiefs of old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How did all this come to pass, and is it good or bad?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1990, the Dag Hamarskjold Foundation organised a conference on governance at the Mweya Safari Lodge in Kasese District. The conference brought together some of Africa's leading social and political science scholars, and political practitioners -- like Kenyan politician Martin Shikuku.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Yoweri Museveni was invited as a speaker to one of their sessions. Museveni repeated his now familiar criticism of parties. That in Africa they are not formed on a &quot;scientific&quot; basis; that political parties were and are organised around classes in the western world; classes which cut across tribe, religion and sex. (By the way this is not exactly true, and anyone who has read Seymour Lipset and Stein Rokkan's wonderful study of party systems and voter alignments know that too well.) Anyway, these parties supposedly unite people around broad interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni at Mweya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni argued that African, and for that matter Ugandan, politics had an inherent tendency towards tribalism. This because society is still &quot;backward&quot; (classes have not yet emerged) so parties are basically organised around tribe and religion. That they divide the people, and have been the cause of the turmoil of the last many years. Therefore, the NRMs' broadbased arrangement is superior in &quot;backward societies where there are no classes&quot; because it does not exclude one on the basis of one's tribe or religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This case was made partly to justify the NRM's suspension of open political parties activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the chaps at the seminar were significant people in their own, and not being employees of Museveni's government, did not have to lick his boots. They told him frankly that there was merit in the NRM &quot;no-party&quot; or movement system, but that the one thing it had not solved was the question of tribalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said if there was an inherent tendency toward tribalism....there was no reason why a movement cannot be tribalistic. That a movement would easily turn into rule by one tribe. The tribes who are NOT represented in its structures, would be very frustrated if because of the ban on non-movement politics, they had no alternative organisation where to make their demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next week we shall revisit some aspects of this line. Nearly four years down the road, the scholars look like they are winning the bet. The NRM's broadbased politics has shown that it is very good at buying time for the wounds in a country which has been in civil war to heal. It was tailor made for a transition/interim period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NRM's poor show</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it has done poorly as a means for resolving the conflicting interests of the various nationalities (tribes) and interest groups. This is partly because movement politics was based on the principle of suppression of certain political demands. If not voluntary suppression (sacrifice) through a gentleman's agreement, then through dictatorial law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To use the popular jargon. It allowed for the rest of the people to look on peacefully and not disrupt as a few (NRM) people were eating. But it has failed to offer ways how those who are at the table eating can leave for the onlookers to take their place, while the first eaters become onlookers too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the NRM group to leave the table for the others would not have been necessary really, if the group had found a way of adding more chairs at the table for everyone to crowd around for the dinner. But they failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is where the NRM got stuck in the mud. Their campaign is now stuck at the level of arguing that since everyone cannot fit at the table, the solution is not to leave it for those who have not eaten, but to allow those who have been eating to sit at it longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buganda, was the first to find a quick way out of it. Like the recent meeting of the CA aspirants resolved, and the Deputy Katikiro Joseph Ssemogerere has hinted, they have said &quot;Okay, we will support the movement system for five more years, but give us our own police force, give our king some power, etc.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In so doing, Buganda is paying the NRM government back in its own currency. When the NRM gave them back a cultural king without powers, it gave them food without salt. In promising to support the NRM's scheme for another five years of the movement system, in exchange for &quot;Buganda's package&quot;, the impression one gets is that the NRM is not interested in what happens fifteen years to come (a long-term and definite constitution order), but only in ruling for another five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Going by the dinner table scenario, Buganda has told the NRM it can continue eating but Buganda will take over the kitchen. In the north, from what people like Adolo Nekyon are saying, the message seems to be that; &quot;Okay, continue eating, and we will not fight for the kitchen with Buganda, but will take over the garden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From what one hears, some parts of the country like West Nile are saying; &quot;We will leave the NRM at the table, Buganda in the kitchen, the north in the garden, but we will take away all the seeds. The East has asked to take the hoes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dividing &quot;Things&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the NRM had proposed how to increase the size of the table and how to add chairs to it, the debating points would have been different. But because it wants to continue sitting and eating at the table, it now has to negotiate with Buganda about allowing the good to be cooked and to come out of the kitchen, With the North about allowing the food to be harvested from the garden and brought to the kitchen. With West Nile not to roast the seeds but allow them to be planted. With the East about letting out the hoes for the gardens to be tilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is why CA aspirants have gone very local. A national all-tribal agenda sounds almost nonsensical in this situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because in many parts of the country what they people want is pretty much settled, there isn't much candidates can do about that. In Buganda for example, whether one is DP, UPC, UPM or CP does not matter much. I cannot see how one would not support most, if not all, of &quot;Buganda's package.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As to who gets to be chosen depends on who makes the people feel good most. And in many parts of the country this means the candidates who pay the voters most money. Nothing most captures this than the reports that in many areas voter registration certificates are called &quot;dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NRM and its candidates are in double jeopardy. For many years they thought the &quot;correctness of (their) line&quot; and the wonders that their rule has brought self-evident. Realising that no one will listen to or vote for a candidate who only; talks about the correctness of a line, NRM candidates have had to &quot;reintroduce&quot; themselves -- as individuals -- to the people, and bring their campaign down to earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is why its the NRM heavies like First Deputy Premier Eriya Kategaya in Rwampara, Transport Minister Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda in Kabale, Minister of State for Defence Amama Mbabazi with his helicopter arrival in Kinkizi who had convoys of tens of cars and hundreds of bicycles on their way to and from nomination. The stakes are higher for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fortunately because they are the ones at the table, they have the food to pass around -- which looks good for their changes of winning at the polls.  It waits to be seen whether it will be possible to fashion a clear &quot;NRM agenda&quot; on the CA floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If parties had been operational, I doubt that the regional and tribal agendas we are seeing would have come up. And this would have made it easier for the NRM to have its way.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAILY OBSERVER, February 15, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a former president of the World Bank, Mr. Barber B. Conable, puts it:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Investment in education contributes as much to economic progress as investment in roads, power plants, the tourist industry or any other physical capital; in fact, the economic returns to investment in education, as measured by productivity and income, are often higher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This thesis can be demonstrated in down-to-earth ways in The Gambia.  Many of our drivers are illiterate. They cannot read road signs and are ignorant of the principles of the internal combustion engine. The result is poor driving, bad road manners and misuse of cars and lorries. Although wages paid to our construction workers and labourers are some of the lowest in the world, the cost of their labour, increased by their low productivity, is relatively very high.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our largely illiterate farmers make a hard living by primitive methods. With about 75% of our population employed in farming, this industry adds only about 48% to our gross national product. In short, the social costs of our illiteracy are high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The personal and private costs of illiteracy are high, also. This has been demonstrated clearly; in the case of girls and women. Women are the first educators of the nation's children. There is close positive correlation between the education of the mother and the health, nutritional status and life chances of her children and of her family as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In short, the progress of our nation in the complex modern world largely depends on our improving dramatically our literacy rate. Literacy might not be the sole factor, but it is definitely a major factor, in making progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The overall illiteracy statistics conceal serious inequalities in our society. This social handicap is not evenly distributed. There are great geographical disparities in its prevalence. Banjul and the Greater Banjul area have the highest number of literates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also disparity between men and women, and between urban and rural dwellers, with many more literate men than women, and proportionately more town dwellers literate than villagers. And, of course, illiteracy being one of the syndromes of poverty, it follows that the lower socio-economic classes in this country are overwhelmingly illiterate. Divisions like this in any society are clearly unjust. One important task of our Government, therefore, is to find ways to expand the provision for education, especially basic education, and make it accessible to those who for historical, cultural and economic reasons are now deprived of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Implications of Introducing Basic Education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such a programme needs heavy investment. It may be difficult for Government to find money from internal resources for any meaningful quantitative and qualitative improvement of our educational system. As a result, Government needs to secure external aid or grants to serve this purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another problem is the recruiting and retraining of the army of qualified teachers needed for these reforms. For a long time now we have had over 60% of our primary school teachers unqualified and untrained. Those of us who are in grassroots contact with schools know that &quot;unqualified and untrained&quot; in this context includes a great number of teachers who often barely keep one page ahead of the class they teach. Nowadays, Gambia College cannot attract entrants in sufficient numbers for their teacher-training courses. At high school level, there are more teachers leaving the school classroom, especially those in key subjects like sciences and mathematics, than there are graduates willing to go to the classroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other problems are curricula that tend to alienate the child from his environment, and do not help him very much to fit into the world of work, leading to the prevalent attitude that schooling is not very beneficial to someone who wants to make his way successfully in an aggressive, materialistic world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And of course, especially for non-formal and adult education, the use of English, which though the official language is foreign and difficult, does not make things easy for the educational planner and teacher.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAILY OBSERVER, February 14, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many households in urban and rural areas from season to season face food insecurity. According to United Nations office in Banjul, poverty is the root cause of food insecurity. Insufficient food and people suffering from dietary and cardiovascular diseases which are present in The Gambia are signs of malnutrition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Gambia, three pockets of malnutrition have been identified.  Malnutrition in pregnant and breastfeeding women, malnutrition of infants and young children, and finally a food gap period of lean seasons are common in Africa. We need a positive approach to arresting the situation. I think a commitment to positive action to stem the tide of human suffering caused by hunger and malnutrition in The Gambia remains a challenge for us all today as in the past. There are cases of chronically undernourished people; people consuming too little food to meet minimal energy needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The people who are vulnerable to good insecurity are the &quot;have-nots&quot;.  What about the &quot;haves&quot;? They look strong and healthy! Food insecurity is higher in rural areas than the urban area. It is time to act! Freedom from hunger and malnutrition was recognised as a human rights with the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. It was reaffirmed as recently as 1989 in the Convention of Rights of the Child. To these conventions, The Gambia is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hunger and malnutrition are no longer principally agricultural and health problems. Nutrition is a direct outcome and has an influence on national development. It belongs to the mainstream of economic and social development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deforestation in The Gambia is creating an &quot;energy crisis&quot; which has a direct bearing on nutrition and family care. The alarm rate of bush fires in The Gambia and the use of fire as the traditional method of land clearing is yearly reducing the fertility of our agroecology. Every year the burning of vegetation spreads the threat of desertification in the sahel regions. Modern agriculture like agroforestry, community forestry, fruit and vegetable farming have raised the hope that hunger would be eliminated with efficient management of land and water resources. Many farming practices like monoculture agriculture and shifting cultivation, which are unscientific, have resulted in environmental degradation. The productive potential of the land has consequently been reduced , creating insecurity in food production.  Environmentally sound agriculture protects food security. Nutrition is a vital part of human ecology; the greatest impact of humanity on the environment stems from the need for food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government should support the efforts of the farming communities.  These people in their struggle for immediate survival, are driven to practices that damage the environment and, in the process, undermine their own food security.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFRICA NEWS SERVICE, Mbuji-Mayi, Zaire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A young man with a wry smile holds a stone up to the setting equatorial sun, the glint in his eye as strong as the one between his fingers. Two mud-stained boys wash the dirt away from their pebbles in a puddle marring one of Mbuji -Mayi's crumbling red roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Down the valley, the rusting Mobutu Sese Seko dredge, named after Zaire's president, clanks and sputters along to spit out the government's diamonds that have helped keep him in power for nearly 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If there is anywhere in this sprawling central African country that vividly reflects the dreams, wealth, corruption and self-sufficiency that have characterized Zaire for decades it is Mbuji-Mayi, a city of 1 million in East Kasai province that is as run-down as it is rich. There's no electricity, a few paved roads, no state hospitals and no telephones. Yet, about $15 million enters the city each week to feed the burgeoning diamond market, dealers say.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Since I've been here I've never seen a program by the government, neither from the (local) government or Kinshasa,&quot; says Kadiata Mukamba, president of the 32-year-old state-run diamond mining industry, known as Miba. &quot;This city is constructed by the people themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed it is, much like the American Wild West had been. It's a city of traders, miners, heroes and villains, where diamonds and $100 bills cross tables on one side of the street and merchants sell chickens and peanuts on the other. Millionaires are made. Hearts and backs are broken. Marriages fail and families dissolve while young men work dusk-to-dawn picking through the earth looking for the big score.  Students hand over school fees directly to their teachers who haven't been paid by the government for two years.  Youngsters fill rain-gouged trenches in the roads with sandbags.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the people's tolerance has its limits.  Mbuji-Mayi has recently become a political symbol of resistance for pro-democracy advocates against the government's ineptitude and President Mobutu's prolonged rule, with people here expressing their dissatisfaction with him and his consorts where it hurts them most: the pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbuji-Mayi's population and the entire regions of East and West Kasai have virtually created their won economy, based almost entirely on dollars and diamonds.  &quot;We are an enclave,&quot; says Mukamba.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have refused to accept a new currency, the new zaire, introduced by the government of Prime Minister Faustin Birindwa -- widely labeled a Mobutu puppet -- last October as part of a disastrous effort at economic reform. One Western diplomat characterized the reform as something officials concocted as a &quot;way of getting their hands into someone else's pocket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials require exporters to receive payment from the Central Bank at the low official exchange rate, about 30 zaires to the dollar, while the government profits on the premium that the hard currency they deposit there brings on the black market where a dollar trades at 120 zaires.  The loss suffered by exporters leads many to ignore legal channels altogether, breeding corruption and diminishing government revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People in Mbuji-Mayi are ignoring the new currency, largely to demonstrate their support for Etienne Tshisekedi, a Kasaian, who Mobutu fired as prime minister last year. Many Zaireans consider Tshisekedi to be the only uncorruptible opponent to the president -- a view challenged by some Western diplomats and some of his former colleagues, including Birindwa. As part of their economic coup, people here have managed to keep their parallel exchange rate stable for four months. On the other hand, the capital, Kinshasa, is suffering the same economic woes that sent the inflation rate up to 8,000 percent last year -- one of the highest in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government's solution to Mbuji-Mayi's monetary rebellion was a standard one for Zaire. It sent in the troops, about 200 of them. They have tried to execute their mission by roughing up, and in some cases killing, money changers , seizing the old zaires and burning them in front of the Bank of Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It hasn't worked very well. Many of the poorly paid soldiers would rather keep the money for themselves. Two of Mobutu's sons have even ignored the decree to shun the money, visiting Mbuji-Mayi on business since the monetary reform went into effect, said one foreign diamond buyer, speaking on condition that he not be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite its wealth, Mbuji-Mayi isn't without its troubles. While Zaireans continue to strike it rich, along with British, Lebanese, Belgian and Israeli diamond dealers, Miba is near collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rats, snakes, and bats have infested the building where the diamonds are cleaned and sorted. Machinery constantly breaks down and spare parts are scarce. Safety precautions are often ignored.  When about 50 illegal miners, or &quot;clandestines&quot; as they are known, were arrested on Miba's property recently they were jammed into a small, wet jail cell at the mine. A storm struck and knocked an electrical cable to the floor, instantly killing all of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miba employs 6,400 people and is Zaire's second largest industry behind the state-run copper and cobalt producing plant, Gecamines, in southern Shaba province, whose production fell from about $500 million to a scant $20 million last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The costs to operate Miba far outweigh what it earns, Mukamba says. He says it can barely produce 400,000 karats per month, whereas it produced more than twice that much monthly only five years ago. It sells about $4 million in diamonds per month, compared to $5 million per week sold by Mbuji-Mayi's 30 or so private dealers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Theft is also a big problem for the industry. Only 30 percent of the gem quality diamonds reach the end of the production line, said one well-placed employee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The current governor, he acquisitions what he wants of the merchandise,&quot; says Mukamba. &quot;We buy a lot of fuel and food from Zambia, Zimbabwe or South Africa. These goods and fuel must pass by Shaba.  Very often our products are stolen with the approval of the regional authorities.  There are days and weeks when (the employees) don't work because of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it doesn't stop there. Private dealers say the governor, Bashala Kantu wa Milandu, routinely takes 10 percent off the purchase of any diamond over 20 karats. In the past year alone, four stones over 100 karats have been found in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kantu wa Milandu vehemently denies any wrongdoing. &quot;It is the people who try to corrupt us.  It isn't the officials who are corrupt, above all, me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although 80 percent of the diamonds that are found in the region are industrial quality -- Zaire is the world's second largest producer of industrial diamonds behind Australia -- many high-quality large gemstones come from the Mbuji-Mayi area, says Greg Stephenson, the director of the De Beers Central Selling Organization's office in Mbuji-Mayi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaireans are making a profit on that, and some of them are striking it rich. Last year, a small group of peasants sold a stone worth $8.5 million, nearly all of which they have already spent, Zairean dealers say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malika Ngandu is somewhat of a hero among the young miners who flock to Mbuji -Mayi. He is known around town as &quot;the president,&quot; for his support of the local soccer team and his reputation as a wealthy and powerful man.  Ngandu, 36, says he makes about $15,000 per month as a diamond buyer and seller. At least 100 people, he says, depend on his earnings, including his three wives and 15 children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If I had continued school I would have become jobless today,&quot; says Ngandu. &quot;I have friends with whom I studied and they're on the street with frayed pants and they're out of work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the lure of wealth and the motivation simply to make a living in an area where there are few jobs and little infrastructure is damaging to more than just the land. It is eating away at the region's culture and traditions as well , aid workers and missionaries say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many children have left the villages for Mbuji-Mayi and have given up on education, which is traditionally received from a child's grandfather. In the melting pot of Mbuji-Mayi, people are losing touch with their native languages, mixing the French brought by the Belgian colonizers, and the traditional languages of Lingual from the west and the local Tshiluba tongue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People have also discarded efforts at agriculture, farming almost entirely on a subsistence level in a region that missionaries say once produced corn for the entire country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even Zairean products are becoming more scarce, in part due to the lack of adequate roads to import goods. Many goods are brought in from abroad. The government has stopped direct flights from abroad to Mbuji-Mayi, requiring them to stop in Lubumbashi to the south, or Kinshasa, fearful that Kasains would no longer need the rest of the country for anything, raising the specter of secession. The southern Kasai region proclaimed itself the Independent Mining State of South Kasai in 1960, but it only lasted until 1961.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think the government is very wary of making the two Kasais (east and west) too independent,&quot; says Stephenson. &quot;They've got all the wealth (here) already. The last thing they need is for Mbuji-Mayi to be completely self-sufficient.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEEKEND OBSERVER, February 25-27, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The matriarch of the Kunta Kinteh family of 'Roots' fame, 80-year-old Mrs. Binta Kinteh, has said she has nothing against going to the United States, provided certain conditions are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Kinteh was commenting on plans by the U.S.-based tour operator, R.G. Gainey and Associates, to take her on speaking tours of American cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a release faxed to this paper on Tuesday, the president and owner of the tour company, Miss Rosetta Gainey, said her organisation will sponsor Mrs. Kinteh's first visit in to the United States, scheduled for September to October this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the release, Mrs. Kinteh is to visit several cities and speak at colleges, universities, and various organisations on the Kinteh family story and her meeting with Alex Haley prior to the publication of the widely-acclaimed 'Roots.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The release added that funds raised fro the speaking engagements will be used to develop and preserve Juffure, Kunta Kinteh's ancestral village in The Gambia. It concluded by stating that, &quot;the development and preservation of Juffure are activities that were never started or supported in the past; and activities greatly needed not only for the people of the village but for history&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Put to her, the old by firm Kinteh matriarch, surrounded buy three generations of family members, said that Mrs. Gainey visited the village twice in 1992, on July 30, and again in November, accompanied by a significant number of African-American tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Kinteh maintained that during her first visit Mrs. Gainey had promised to rebuild the Kinteh family home from its present derelict state.  She said Mrs. Gainey reaffirmed her promise on her second trip, when she organised a cultural festival in the village, and during the celebrations proffered Mrs. Kinteh a $500 cheque towards the reconstruction of the family compound. This she said, was later taken from her by Mrs. Gainey, with the promise she would give her a heftier cheque. This, however, never came. Mrs.  Kinteh stated that since then, they did not hear anything from Rosetta Gainey until November 29 last year, when her supposed agent, Mr. Modou Gassama of Brikama, visited the village bearing two signboards, one proclaiming &quot;Housing Project for Mrs. Binta Kinteh&quot;, the other &quot;Construction of a Multi-Purpose Youth Centre, Juffure-Albreada&quot;. Nothing transpired again, until mid December, when Mr. Gassama came once more, this time bringing a letter informing her of the proposed trip to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Kinteh said she and her family deliberated on the issue, and collectively laid down conditions which must be fulfilled before she is willing to leave for the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She declined to go into detail, but disclosed that the Kinteh family have agreed that before she leaves Juffure, a binding contract must be drawn up with Rosetta Gainey in person. She said the services of a lawyer will be sought. She also disclosed that the family did not favour the &quot;intervention of any middle-man&quot; in their dealings with Mrs. Gainey. &quot;We want to correspond with her directly,&quot; she stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said this was necessitated by unfortunate past experiences. &quot;We have been taken for a ride many a time in the past. Now we are resolved not to allow such thing to happen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alex Haley and 'Roots'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on Alex Haley, Mrs. Kinteh said she first met him in 1972.  This was followed by visits to Juffure in 1979, 1982 and 1987. He came with his family during the third visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She recounted the blessing of the 'Roots' immortalisation of her village as resulting tin th provision of pipe-borne water, electricity and gravelled roads. The place has also become a tourist attraction.  Nevertheless, Mrs. Kinteh recollected a series of promises, made to her by Alex Haley, that were never kept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among these, she particularly felt, were the promise of a trip to the holy shrine at Mecca, and the rebuilding of the dilapidated family home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The construction of a mosque was begun, but it is still incomplete.  Quizzed on whether Alex had bequeathed to her anything from his huge wealth, Mrs. Kinteh said they have not received a penny.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAILY OBSERVER, March 2, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Executive Secretary, Women's Bureau, Mrs. Isatou Njie-Saidy, has said that from an Islamic point of view, female genital mutilation or female circumcision is not a religious requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In her address at the opening of the Regional Workshop on African Women and Tradition, Culture and Religion, held at the Atlantic Hotel yesterday, Mrs. Njie-Saidy pointed out that as a representative of a country where Islam is the predominant religion, she and others have been educated to the knowledge that circumcision is neither encouraged nor advised by Islamic scholars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That leaves culture and tradition as being squarely responsible for this practice, whose wisdom is increasingly being challenged in various quarters,&quot; she declared. She pointed out, however, that not all of our culture and traditions are anti-development and unprogressive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Executive Secretary asserted that in an era when the drive towards greater social enlightenment has become all-embracing, the situation of a society divided between privileged and under-privileged based on sex, race or creed is an affront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In this workshop, we shall have the opportunity to exchange ideas on experiences and efforts being made, and progress attained in the struggle for the betterment of women in our various communities,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Njie-Saidy also briefly touched on what Gambian women have been engaged in during the last decade. She said that at the national level, there has been an increased awareness in the last decade or so about what really needs to be done, and how to go about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;About 14 years ago, the Government of The Gambia established the National Women's Council and Bureau by an Act of Parliament, to advise government on all matters affecting the welfare of Gambian women,&quot; she recalled. She pointed out that The Gambia's Women's Bureau, among other achievements, has been instrumental in creating greater awareness at all levels of women's problems and concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In all these development schemes and programmes, we are alive to the fact that, irrespective of what amount of legislation is put in place, the beneficiaries of the laws enacted, conventions signed, ratified and codified, can only be positively affected if they are part and parcel of the processes themselves, and people are convinced of their significance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Knowing rights, duties and obligations enables women, as mothers, housewives and carers, to know what is convenient as a family size and what is possible to shoulder in terms of rearing children, she asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We must, as organisations, individuals and community groups from various countries, commit ourselves, as never before, to ensure that decisions taken and affecting the welfare of women are put into practice,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his address of welcome, the director, African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies, Mr. Raymond Sock, said that the workshop is important because it gives African women scholars, activists and mothers, and indeed some men, a unique opportunity to explore some of the themes relevant to women's rights in Africa, prior to the regional meeting for the Fourth World Conference on women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He described the workshop as timely, as it provides a touchstone for some of the issues of burning concern to African women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although this workshop will concentrate on the effects of tradition, culture and religion on the realisation of women's rights in Africa, it is hoped that our discussions over the next five days will provide a catalyst for further investigation into other spheres of life militating against the advancement of women in Africa.&quot; Mr. Sock said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The workshop, which ends on Friday, is being attended by 25 participants from Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Cape Verde, Canada, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Tunisia, the United Kingdom and The Gambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE GHANAIAN CHRONICLE, March 7-9, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Journalists in war-ravaged Northern Region have dumped their pens and notepads in protest against censorship and manipulation of news on the ethnic conflict in the area by the government and editors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At an emergency meeting of the regional branch of the Ghana Journalists' Association (GJA) in Tamale last Thursday (March 3), the journalists resolved not to file any more reports on the four-week old conflict between Konkombas, and Nanumbas, Dagombas and Gonjas that has driven 2,000 people to their graves and 120,000 into refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A resolution addressed to the GJA headquarters and the National Media Commission, protested the blackout of the news they had filed on the war by their Accra-based bosses, especially those in the state-owned media.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said: &quot;The manner in which news on the current crisis and similar incidents in the region in the past has been treated by the editors has cast a slur on the competence and credibility of journalists on the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citing instances, the journalists said reports sent by local correspondents at the outbreak of the war on February 3, were not used. Much later, an official statement issued by the Number Two Brigade Commander in Accra was published as having been made in Tamale when nothing of the sort took place in Tamale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This was followed by the President's tour of the conflict areas which was also given wide coverage even though the news content was the same as that contained in earlier reports filed by local correspondents and which had not been used.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recalling the latest incident in Tamale on Tuesday, March 1, in which security men shot and killed 15 people, the journalists complained that editors decided to use an official statement issued in Accra instead of oven-fresh reports from their correspondents on the spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said while they were not averse to official statements issued to clarify or state the government's position, such statements should not be substituted with reports filed on the same issue by accredited reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Lives of reporters are put at risk as a result of confrontation with the public which thinks that we are unduly shelving reports on the situation, especially when incidents of lesser dimensions elsewhere are given prominence,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result of that and the fact that they are not insured, the journalists resolved not to put their lives on the line, covering such dangerous events until their editors assured them of using their stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We do not deny our editors their prerogative to edit our reports or even decide not to use them at all, but nobody can say it is not news when so many lives and property are destroyed,&quot; the resolution said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision of the journalists could affect the national appreciation of the real situation in the conflict zone. The mobilisation of national and international moral support and resources to cushion the victims of the war could also be hampered by the black-out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government has been sensitive about the nature of news reports, fearing that the content could inflame the still-volatile situation in the war zone. Critics say that amounts to blaming the message on the messenger.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, March 4-10, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the first documents to be presented to the government of national unity in June will be a draft women's charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Women's National Coalition last week brought two years' work to virtual completion when it presented the charter to a conference of over 300 delegates representing more than 80 women's organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Coalition is unlikely to demand the charter's inclusion in the Bill of Rights. Instead, it will be used as a political document to lobby parliament and organise women.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charter is detailed, offering something for all South African women. Flowing from Coalition research into women's needs, it includes sections on the economy, law, education, development, rape and battery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It speaks as much to urban executives through calls for equal taxation as to rural woman by stating that &quot;custom, culture and religion shall be subject to the equality clause in the Bill of Rights&quot; and by promising them a say in development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women leaders will find comforting its promise that no tier of government will be without women representatives. Many ideas in the charter aim to improve the lot of women in the informal sector while other working women are catered for by a package of proposals which includes equal access to education and training, equal pay and improved childcare facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charter dodges the issue of polygamy, promotes freedom of choice on abortion and calls for the legalisation of prostitution. These nettles may take time to grasp but changes likely to occur soon after the installation of a government of national unity may see higher numbers f women judges and magistrates, gender balance in the human rights and gender commissions as well as in the constitutional court. The charter also calls for state-funded counseling centres for women who are battered and raped, but does not promise free health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a move that took some by surprise, the ANC Women's League supported a National Party motion for the dissolution of the Coalition. &quot;Most regions felt that because the charter is ready, there is no reason for the Coalition to continue,&quot; said Thandi Modise, deputy president of the League.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference instead decided to extend the life of the Coalition to the end of June when the charter will be presented to the first parliamentary session of a government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New faces will lead the Coalition: some full-time staffers have left, while parliamentary candidates who also held leadership positions in the Coalition have had to step down,. The Coalition's steering committee is to meet soon to decide on replacements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUNDAY NATION, February 20, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Efforts are underway to stop the shipment of 160 barrels of toxic mercury compound from the United States, destined for the Thor Chemicals plant in Cato Ridge in the Natal Midlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shipment will arrive at the Durban harbour tomorrow and is expected to be greeted by a protest demonstration by South African environmentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shipment has been sent by US company, Borden Chemical and Plastics Inc., which has claimed that it is merely recycling &quot;spent mercuric chloride catalyst&quot; that it originally purchased from Thor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of the conditions of sale dictate that the product be sent back to Thor when much of the mercuric chloride is used up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thor then burns the catalyst in a high-temperature incinerator to extract any remaining mercury and use it to produce more catalyst, said Thor spokesperson John MacDonald.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But spokesperson for the Environmental Justice Networking Forum, Chris Albertyn, rejected Thor's claim, pointing out that the substance being shipped to Thor should be classified as toxic waste and banned from being imported in to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Albertyn also said that because Thor has not yet received a permit to operate the incinerator from the Department of National Health, &quot;Thor is sitting with two million kilograms of toxic waste on its premises that is not being recycled&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the waste poses a danger of seeping into the soil and groundwater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that even when the substance is incinerated, there is no way of preventing toxic substances, including mercury and chloride, from being released into the air from the incinerator smokestack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MacDonald said until a permit for the incinerator is granted, the catalyst from Borden is being kept in triple-lined ponds with alarm systems to detect if there are any leaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the United States' Environmental Protection Agency has declared that incinerating mercury-laden waste is the best known technology for dealing with the waste - which is banned in US landfills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MacDonald also denied that toxic fumes would be emitted and said: &quot;I am sure that there is more mercury emitted from an average South African braai than from Thor's incinerator smokestacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Thor has said it will stop mercury recycling by 1996, Albertyn said the amount of waste coming from Borden will be too much to handle by 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This may run into problems with a future ANC environmental policy opposing the import of toxic waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, if Thor is no longer reprocessing the waste, US laws will force Borden to stop exporting the substance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Borden has currently been allowed to export the substance under the auspices that it will be recycled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thor Chemicals has been dogged by controversy for allegedly failing to ensure safety procedures for its workers at its plant. Three senior executives are facing charges of culpable homicide in connection with the death of one worker from mercury poisoning. The executives also face 46 counts of breaches of safety laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, March 4-10, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC has suggested former British ambassador to South Africa Robin Renwick and former Nigerian military ruler General Olesegun Obasanjo as foreign mediators on South Africa's constitutional deadlock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sources said the ANC had also indicated strong support for a mediator from the US, but had not proposed a name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under local and international pressure, the ANC has grudgingly accepted foreign mediation in exchange for the Inkatha Freedom Party's provisional registration for the April election. The behind-the-scenes agreement was struck at a marathon eight-hour summit in Durban this week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prime mover behind Tuesday's Royal Hotel summit is understood to have been Tongaat Hulett managing director Chris Saunders. Previously a staunch ally of Buthelezi, Saunders has forged ties with Mandela since his release from prison. In the international community, one of the strongest advocates of foreign mediation has been the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi has in the past proposed mediation under the Commonwealth or the Organisation of African Unity., Sources said he had also proposed an Italian-based body called the Council of Venice. Apparently rightwing and largely unknown, this is seen as a non-starter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's acceptance of foreign mediation is a major victory of Buthelezi. It will return him to the international limelight, and he may use it to try and extract further concessions from the ANC, including a postponement of the April poll on grounds that the IFP needs time to gear up its election machinery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources revealed that the kwaZulu caucus agreed at a meeting on Wednesday that the IFP should &quot;provisionally&quot; register for election. And IFP central committee meeting scheduled for this morning is expected to adopt a similar position. The deadline for the registration of political parties is today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a tough round of negotiations lies ahead. In his latest gambit, Buthelezi has told the kwaZulu caucus that Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini is standing firm on his demand that a Zulu kingdom -- separate from the rest of South Africa -- be guaranteed in the interim constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But once foreign mediators intervene, Buthelezi could find pressure on him mounting to adopt a pragmatic stance and agree to contest elections -- or risk being exposed as a spoiler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview, the Commonwealth's special representative in South Africa, Moses Anafu, said the body was &quot;willing, able and ready&quot;: to send a mediation team to South Africa in a week's time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anafu said the Commonwealth could either engage in &quot;shuttle diplomacy&quot; or chair roundtable talks among the ANC, IFP, government and the Zulu monarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that a mediation team could include a traditional leader -- such as the king of Malaysia of the Sultan of Sokoto -- to handle the thorny issue of Zwelithini's demand for a sovereign and independent kingdom in kwaZulu/Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But other sources said the ANC has steadfastly rejected the Commonwealth offer, partly because it fears that Nigeria -- a strong proponent of federalism -- could wield enormous influence in the mediation team. Others countered that the ANC could rely on the support of countries like India and Zimbabwe to counter Nigerian influence and that the Commonwealth was bound to adopt and impartial stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources said that OAU, which also announced this week that it was willing to mediate, has also been rejected by the ANC, seeing it as a weak body which has failed to resolve conflicts in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources said the ANC preferred a mediator from Britain or the US, as having the clout to force the IFP to compromise and contest elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obasanjo -- who heads the New York-based Africa Leadership Forum -- is also a favoured choice as he has developed &quot;chemistry&quot; with both Mandela and Buthelezi. Now seen in some circles and an &quot;elder statesman&quot; of Africa, he led the Commonwealth Emminent Person's Group to South Africa on a fact-finding mission in the 1980s in a failed bid to find common ground between the then-banned ANC and the PW Botha regime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFRICA SOUTH &amp; EAST, February 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the Angolan peace talks lurch through round after round, a radical German humanitarian organisation is hard at work rolling back the deadly debris of decades of war. As a form of radical preventive health care, the organisation destroys weaponry to avoid having to treat its effects in deaths and injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cap Anamur -- essentially, German Emergency Doctors -- arrived in Cunene Province a year ago to find it crippled by conflict, with thousands of landmines and tons of leftover high explosive ammunition posing a daily threat to the weary civilian population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Working under the banner of &quot;Radical Pacifism, Radical Neutrality, Radical Humanitarianism,&quot; they set to work clearing away the danger. Using converted high-tech East German military gear including white-painted tans and trucks originally designed to withstand the Siberian winter, Cap Anamur and their Angolan sappers have cleared 7,500 mine. From unguarded and precarious dumps, they have removed 50,000 high explosive missiles and shells, 200,000 smaller shells and over 49 tons of assorted explosives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All the munitions are destroyed in massive controlled blasts. &quot;We are using the weapons of war to fight a war on war...a nice concept, don't you think?&quot; We love destroying arms,&quot; says project manager Hendrik Ehlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By supporting recovery of the infrastructure and making the province safer for vulnerable local people, Cap Anamur enforce their commitment to disarmament. Fields abandoned for 15 years are again being cultivated as mines are removed and confidence that they will not be blown up returns to the farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roads in Cunene are generally so bad that the few functioning vehicles avoid them and health care collapsed long ago, leaving some areas with no child vaccination. Water remains a commodity some must walk 40km to draw from a dirty river. In towns and villages, once-splendid colonial buildings are now piles of rubble, while the roofless shells of post offices, schools and hospitals rot away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Namacunde, just short of the Namibian border, American food aid is one of the few items on sale at the local market, where the Angolan Kwanza trades at 7,000 to one against the US dollar. Care International and the UN World Food Programme truck tonnes of food aid into needy areas of the province, where war and drought have depleted grain stocks. Military hardware and burnt-out tanks are interspersed with civilian vehicles destroyed by land mines along the sides of the rutted toads, while huge areas of wasteland bear testimony to exploded ammunition dumps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although there is relative peace in Cunene, travellers on some roads are still hijacked by bandits using landmines as a somewhat indiscriminate weapon in their armed robberies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mines don't have friends,&quot; says a military lieutenant in Cahama, an old site of battle between South Africa forces, the MPLA and Swapo. The deadly legacy of mines and ammunition dumps have cost scores of lives in the province, in a country with the world's highest amputee population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the enthusiasm of the Cap Anamur &quot;desminagem&quot; has made a real difference. The organisation also runs the only functioning workshop for 200km and use their former surplus military vehicles for bridge-building and the transportation of medical supplies in a region desperately short of transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All they know here is famine, warm shitty weather and malaria,&quot; says Edith Fischnaller, a Cap Anamur nurse who rehabilitated an old hospital in Oncocua in the remote southwest which now serves 100,000 people over a 300km radius. She arrived a year ago to find the hospital a shell destroyed in 1981 by South African forces, while untreated diseases devastated the largely nomadic population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Government has since sent three nurses and eight assistants, but few medicines reach Oncocua in addition to those from German public donations. When Fischnaller arrived, hundreds were dying of a measles epidemic. None have died so far this year. She has learned basic surgical techniques, performing amputations where necessary and with the help of a new doctor from Germany she recently delivered a child by emergency caesarian section, proudly showing off a healthy mother and baby who would otherwise have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cap Anamur don't pretend that volunteer efforts like theirs can clean up the whole country. That will require massive resources and an acceptance of responsibility from the militias who left behind their deadly weapons in th first place. And before that can happen, commitment has to be found to stop the fighting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SUNDAY NATION, February 20, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is buying 20 American-made aircraft for election monitoring - but no one in the commission is prepared to discuss the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The project is already under fire from politicians who argue that the IEC should either lease the planes or use the SA Air Force's surveillance aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democratic Party's (DP) Tony Leon said it was &quot;shocking&quot; to learn about such a deal while the ANC's Popo Molefe said he would have expected the IEC to lease airplanes &quot;if they need them so desperately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The criticism levelled against the deal is based on the fact that the 20 airplanes will cost the taxpayers approximately R77,8-million - yet they will only be used for about a month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission's chairperson, Judge Johann Kriegler, added to the controversy by denying the report. He refused to confirm the deal and could only say that a statement would be made &quot;at an appropriate time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The discussion with an irate Kriegler went this way: &quot;We are not buying them,&quot; and when asked whether they were leasing them: &quot;No!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when asked whether the IEC would use any aircraft during the monitoring of the election: &quot;We will use them but we are not buying them.&quot; And when asked where they would get them from: &quot;We will make an announcement at an appropriate time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Daniel Lewis, the marketing manager of Ayres Corporation - the manufacturing company - confirmed that the IEC had bought the aircraft. He also confirmed reports that 10 of them would arrive in South Africa on March 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The planes - known as Turbo Thrushes - are manufactured for use in the spraying of crops and fire-fighting. They have speeds of up to 200 kilometres an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They only take two people on board and can fly up to 880 kilometres without stopping. Orange Free State farmers hire it for spraying and pay R2,700 per hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to Sunday Nation from the corporation's headquarters in Georgia, USA, Lewis said the planes would fly from the United States to Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For such long flights, they use the tank which normally holds the chemicals...This tank is huge and the plane can fly for up to 12 hours,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surveillance equipment such as video cameras will be fitted by the buyer, Lewis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked to comment about Lewis' confirmation, Kriegler said: &quot;I am telling you that is not true, you should wait until we make a statement.&quot; He would not say when exactly such a statement would be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, according to Lewis, part of the amount involved has already been paid. He would not disclosed the exact figure or discuss the deal any further, saying that it was up to the customer - the IEC - to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports from aviation experts suggest it would prove difficult for the IEC to sell all these aircraft after the election. They said the company had only been able to sell 19 of them in the 1984 to 1988 period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lewis said the company had sold about 800 since the planes went in to production in 1976. There were less than 10 of them in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The buying of the planes was welcomed by the National Party's Daniel du Plessis, saying that &quot;with the high level of intimidation for which members of the ANC, PAC, AWB and other radical organisations are responsible, any step will be welcomed by the National Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">INTERVIEW</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">814 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Corporate Council on Africa, launched late last year by a group of major American companies, was established to promote U.S. business investment in Africa. Founding members include Coca-Cola, General Motors, Mobil, Equator Bank and AST Research. Other leading members include a former assistant secretary of state for Africa, Chester Crocker; former U.S.  ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young; C. Payne Lucas, president of the Washington, D.C.-based development organization Africare; and David Miller, a senior White House official in the Bush administration. Chrysler joined the organization last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council's board is chaired by Safi Qureshey, co-founder and chairman of AST Research, which has grown rapidly since its founding to 1980 to become currently the fourth largest computer company in the United States and the sixth in the world. Last year, the company took a big leap with the acquisition of Tandy's PC manufacturing operations. Qureshey, 42, is an engineer with degrees from both the University of Karachi in Pakistan and the University of Texas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Qureshey described the goals of the council in an interview, excerpted below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFRICANEWS: Is the Corporate Council on Africa primarily a grouping of companies already involved in Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SQ: Some of our members have tremendous experience doing business in Africa. They have plants and operations in Africa. Then there are newer companies such as AST who are looking at Africa with an open mind. We're not just bringing in the companies that have interest in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This a group of companies looking at the 590 million people in Africa as a potential long-term market for American businesses. We want to expose Africa to other businesses, to educate the business community to the opportunities that exist there, despite all the negative news we read day in and day out. To be engaged over there and not get discouraged by the difficulties that any new market may represent. To put Africa back on the map.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People talk a lot about the former Soviet Union, but that market has not grown as well as expected, despite all the changes that have taken place.  Africa has its own challenges, but its own potential. We believe the changes in South Africa can really turn around perceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: And your company is taking a look at Africa for the first time?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SQ: We have been looking at Africa in the last couple of years. As the world is changing, Africa is changing, and we want to be engaged over there.  Our involvement in the Corporate Council really is a way for finding out more, for playing a positive role in that part of the world also.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AST is a 14-year old company that has been in the fastest growing part of the computer industry. It has gone from three co-founders to 6,700 people around the globe. Besides looking at computers and their uses in North American market and European market, we are looking at some of the emerging markets such as China, where we do very well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are in the information tools business. A bank or a manufacturing company in Africa needs these tools to compete on a global basis. So as the world is changing, and economics is becoming more important, we believe we have something to offer to African businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What kind of reaction are you getting from the business community?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SQ: There is interest. It's a long-term process. It is a challenge to gain attention, because there's so much happening in other parts of the world. Africa has to compete for attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reception from the current administration has been helpful -- Secretary (of Commerce, Ron) Brown coming to our inaugural event. He also took a trade delegation to South Africa, and I can imagine another trip to Africa. The Corporate Council will be active in hosting the business and political leaders coming from Africa and trying to introduce them to the business community over here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Corporate Council on Africa can be contacted at: 1666 Connecticut Avenue, NW Suite 510 Washington, DC 20009 Phone (202) 667-7330.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, March 22-25, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudanese refugees have accused officials of InterAid Uganda of sparking a riot in Kiryangongo Settlement Camp by withholding food for over three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angry refugees visited 'The Monitor' last week and spoke of their months of hunger. They claim not to have received any of the tons of food which were ferried to the camp by InterAid, an NGO which deals with the refugees on behalf of the United Nations High Commission (UNHCR). To survive, they have had to do odd jobs for local villagers in return for one or two pieces of cassava.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On February 19, the refugees rioted. &quot;We broke into the food store because we were starving. Our food was in the store,&quot; the refugees told 'The Monitor'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The refugees believe that the InterAid Programme Coordinator, Andrew Hatch, colluded with the Camp Commandant, Joseph Oketch, to deny them food, although they are unable to substantiate their claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The riot marked the beginning of war between the refugees and InterAid officials. The refugees claim that on February 20, Mr. Hatch threw out all the patients in the dispensary. A patient, Wengish Onena, died which fuelled anger against the officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The refugees said that Hatch also closed the feeding centre, the water system and the grinding mill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the dispensary was later re-opened, it has no drugs or doctors. &quot;The water system is the only facility we have left but InterAid have also threatened to stop it if we continue refusing to work with then,&quot; the refugees said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The grinding mills have been closed since February 19 which means that camp residents can't make posho from the maize that they have recently received. &quot;We now cook the maize and eat it just like that,&quot; a spokesperson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The refugees were also angered by the policemen who were sent in to quell the riot; &quot;They went from house to house, recovering the good, beating up people and looting our property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twenty refugees were rounded up for spearheading the riot. According to the refugees who visited 'The Monitor,' Camp Commander Oketch has told them their friends will only be released if they accept InterAid back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The InterAid Director, Suzan Wong, criticized the refugees fro making false accusations against Andrew Hatch: &quot;They wanted to make the most out of the assistance given so they came up with lies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wong said that InterAid Uganda held discussions with government, UNHCR, and the refugees last week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, March 11-17, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa still has the most unequal distribution of income among countries for which national household income data is available, according to a recent study by the Human Sciences Research Council and the University of Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This contradicts the conventional wisdom that the income gap between rich and poor households is diminishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most common measure of income inequality is the &quot;Gini coefficient&quot;. Simply put, in this measure perfect equality equals zero and perfect inequality equals one. South Africa, with a Gini coefficient of 0,68, heads the list of 36 developing countries. Jamaica, Bahamas and Brazil are next, while Taiwan is at the bottom of the list with a Gini of 0,28.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1991 the poorest 40 percent of households in South Africa earned a mere four percent of the total income earned by South Africans: the richest 10 percent earned more than a half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That South Africa's income gap has not changed between 1975 and 1991 seems to contradict intuitive observations of black advancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The answer to this apparent paradox lies in the changes in incomes among specific sectors within population groups. The richest 20 percent of black households have increased real average incomes by almost 40 percent over the period, making them the most upwardly mobile race group, as black professionals, skilled workers and entrepreneurs benefited from the erosion of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time rising unemployment and several seasons of severe drought have decreased the incomes of the poorest 40 percent of black households by around 40 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The poorest 40 percent of the white population have also seen their incomes drop by a percentage similar to that of the poorest 40 percent of blacks. The incomes of the richest 20 percent of whites, however, have stayed the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This widening of the income gap among black s and whites has meant the overall gap between rich and poor is as wide as ever -- but the divide is no longer exclusively based on race. In 1975 less than 10 percent of the richest 20 percent of households were black. In 1991 this figure has risen to 26 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gini coefficient of the black population group increased from 0,47 to 0,62 between 1975 and 1991, indicating an alarming increase in inequality within black society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gini of the white population rose from 0,36 to 0,46 over the same period. This is in light of whites having a mean income and occupations similar to most first world societies, which have an average Gini of 0,39.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gini coefficients of the coloured and Asian communities remained fairly constant at 0,52 and 0,49 respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main reason for inequality in South Africa is inequality within population groups. Almost three quarters of total inequality can be ascribed to inequality within population groups. The remaining quarter is caused by inequality between groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between 1975 and 1991 population growth outstripped income growth so that the average South African household income decreasing from about R30,000 to R26,000 in 1991 rands. Despite this, a quarter of households managed to increase their incomes over the period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the incomes of the richest 20 percent of black households increased, the incomes of almost all Asian households and 80 percent of coloured households rose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The black share of total income has risen because of the big increase in the incomes of the richest black households. It is still comparatively small. The 1991 household census indicates blacks earned 28 percent of total income, through they constitute 75 percent of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whites, on the other had, comprise 13 percent of the population yet earn 61 percent of total income. Coloureds earn seven percent and Asians four percent of total income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disparity between whites and blacks is further illustrated by the average income of a white household being 12 times greater than the average income of a black household. In 1991 that figure had not changed from the figure in 1960, although it rose to 15 during the high growth years of the 1960s when whites enjoyed virtually all the benefits of economic growth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1960s saw a huge gap develop between the incomes of whites and blacks: the 1980s has seen a similar gap emerging within the black population group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gap between black and white incomes has certainly contributed to the social and political turmoil in South Africa over the past decade and more. The emerging income gap between rich and poor blacks may now threaten the survival of a democratically elected government, in the same way the reaction to the white- black income gap undermined apartheid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is reason enough for reduction of income inequality to become, or remain, a priority in shaping South Africa's economic development policies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH, April 4, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dear Member of Congress,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has come to my attention that Chief M.K.O. Abiola has urged the US Congress to consider several actions concerning Nigeria including the adoption of H.R. Res 151. I regard the adoption of H.R. Res 151 as unfortunate and unnecessary. I am deeply concerned about the wisdom and appropriateness of the current restrictions against Nigeria and cannot begin to understand the basis for any further US actions whether the proposed actions are symbolic or otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As I am sure you are aware, prior to assuming the office of Minister of Foreign Affairs, I was the Vice Presidential candidate on the same ticket with Chief Abiola, the Presidential candidate election in convention by the Social Democratic Party. Chief Abiola and I contested and won the June 12, 1993 election. You probably are also aware that former Head of State, General Babangida annulled the June 12, 1993 election and stepped down on August 26, 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The events surrounding the June annulment of the election caused significant upheaval and chaos. An unelected Interim National Government was installed led by Chief E.A. Shonekan. Chief Shonekan did not command the support and the mandate of the people of Nigeria, and was unable to secure the endorsement of any section of Nigerian society and accordingly was clearly unable to govern. Besides the irretractable political deadlock, the national was paralysed by daily civil disturbances, threats of disintegration and ethnic clashes during October 1993. By the end of October 1993, it was obvious that there was a clear and present danger to the continued existence of a united Nigeria. This instability posed a very serious risk to our national security and the stability of the entire sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of these developments, the widest possible spectrum of Nigerians, increasingly concluded that direct intervention was the only way to stop the drift and create an enabling environment for the resumption of the democratisation process. Chief Abiola and myself were among those who endorsed and actively canvassed for this military crisis with various military caucuses, including General Sani Abacha and his present deputy, General Diya. We were never assured that such an intervention would have restored the annulled June 12 Presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the collapse of the Shonekan government, all of us who fought for democracy and the restoration of the June 12 election met with Chief Abiola on November 21 at his home to consider our reaction to the new development. There were a few vocally expressed dissenting views, including Chief Abiola's, but the overwhelming majority decided that we should cooperate with and participate in the new government if invited to join. At the conclusion of the meeting, Chief Abiola stated that anyone who wished to participate in the new government should feel free to serve if invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was on this basis and after extensive consultation that I decided to accept the position of foreign minister. Dr. Onagoruwa, a frontline human fights activist, was also encouraged by his human rights organisation to accept the offer of Attorney-General. It should also be noted that other prominent members of the Abiola-Kingibe team have also offered their support of this government including Dr. Jonathan Zwingina, Chief Abiola's Presidential Campaign Coordinator, the party's staunch publicists and strategists such as Lateef Jakande, Ebenezer Babatope, Jim Nwobodo, Abubakar Rimi, Solomon Lar, and many other have joined this government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I value my long service to the democratic renewal process in Nigeria.  I was the executive secretary of the Constituent Assembly which reviewed the constitution of Nigeria in 1989 and was subsequently elected Chairman of the Social Democratic Party. While I had a personal interest in upholding of the election results, I like other democrats with impeccable credentials in General Abacha's government, accepted to serve because I felt that given the circumstances, the interest of the country takes precedence over everything else, including my personal ambition. We also believe that we should be in the best position to push the democratic agenda forward from within the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are very pleased to say that the actions we have taken since November 1993 have nevertheless, succeeded in claiming passions and in actively working towards complete national unity. It has restored full freedom of the press and provided opportunity for serious national dialogue.  We envision that through the Constitutional Conference, our people will design a clear direction for building a truly united nation as well as prepare the electoral calendar to end military rule. The inauguration of the National Commission on Constitutional Conference represents a concrete step in the democratic process. The Commission has already concluded its report on the modalities for convening the conference and public option supports these measures as lively debate on the political future of the nation is underway throughout the nation. Notwithstanding press reports to the contrary, the Constitutional Conference is going forward and will aid in the complete unification of our great nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I appreciate the keen interest in the democratic renewal in Nigeria demonstrated by the American people and their representatives in Congress and the Administration. Our government is doing all it can do to create a conducive atmosphere for dialogue and better understanding of our difficulties, hopes and aspirations. Once the programme of activities for the Constitutional Conference are announced, it should show sufficient commitment to the democratisation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, I fully appreciate the support of the United States for the continued unity of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as an indivisible nation.  Nigeria deserves the support of the American Congress, business community and other informed sectors of American society.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My Dear Fellow Statesmen and Stateswomen:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It gives me great pleasure to deliver this message to you to let you know that thanks to the Almighty God, I am alive and well. The struggle to actualise the Nigerian people's decision, taken at the election of June 12th, 1993, has been tough and fraught with danger. But in leading it, I am strengthened by the knowledge that we have the unflinching support of the political leadership of the democratic world, led by the United States. I thank you for the noble part you have played in this effort and humbly enjoin you not to relent in your efforts until the battle is won and the Nigerian people are allowed to install the government of their own choice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I would like you to know that the people of Nigeria have totally rejected General Abacha's military regime. All they want is to be given the opportunity to rule themselves like you do in the United States. On June 12, 1993, they voted as President, a man who presented them with a programme entitled &quot;Farewell to poverty.&quot; They want this programme to be implemented so that they can move forward with confidence into the twenty first century.  General Abacha thought he could confuse the people of Nigeria and let them forget their desire for democracy, by doing tow things as soon as he seized power on November 17, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, instead of handing over the government to me, the elected president, he instead enticed some of my supporters into his government, including my vice- president-elect, Mr. Kingibe, who was made foreign minister. But the Nigerian people realised that what he had done was like someone ignoring president-elect Bill Clinton's victory, capriciously annulling the 1992 Presidential election and proceed to form a &quot;government&quot; with the then Chairman of joint chiefs of staff in charge of it as &quot;Head of State,&quot; and inviting vice-president- elect Al Gore to become secretary of state in that government in an effort to achieve legitimacy and &quot;acknowledgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This ludicrous act of staging &quot;Hamlet Without the Prince&quot; has been roundly condemned as an insult to the intelligence of all Nigerians.  Accordingly, it must also be rejected in its entirety by all people who love democracy everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, General Abacha tried to throw dust into the eyes of Nigerians by proposing to hold a constitutional conference. (Nigeria has an excellent constitution, written in 1989, which has never been tried.) This proposal has been rejected as a waste of time by the intellectuals, human rights organisations, the trade unions, the students, the market women, and the masses of the Nigerian people. They see Abacha's constitutional conference proposal as nothing more than a dangerous ruse which could open a Pandora's Box that could lead Nigeria into untold bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even if a new constitution is promulgated, there can never be another election under it until the June 12 election is actualised. Many of the electors destroyed their registration cards in exasperation when the military annulled the June 12 election. And they have sworn to boycott any new registration, and to ensure that if their votes are regarded as of no consequence, they too will never allow anyone else's votes to count either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> World opinion must force Abacha to allow elected officials to return to their position without further delay. Otherwise, Nigeria is in for a long period of dictatorship, contrary to any claims by Abacha's highly paid public relations consultants and apologists at work in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, we urge your continued support of House Concurrent Resolution 151, introduced by Congressman Payne (D-NJ) in the version recently passed by the House Foreign Affairs, Africa Subcommittee. This would be of tremendous help toward the transition of power to the people's choice as president, in order to begin the long and difficult journey to economic stability and true democracy for Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yours in the service of democracy,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH, April 4, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At about 10 A.M. March 10, the office of the minister of foreign affairs, Baba Gana Kingibe, received an urgent message from the Nigerian embassy in Washington DC. It was brief: Switch on the fax machine for an important document. The document was faxed to the office at about 11.24 a.m. It was a one page letter, June 12 Must Stand, addressed to the president of the United States, his secretary of state and members of the US Congress. The letter was written buy Moshood Abiola and published also in &quot;Roll Call&quot;, which is said to be a newspaper published in Capitol Hill and is widely read by members of Congress, for a wider public consumption. However it looks like a newsletter published by lobbyists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola, presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, in the June 12 presidential election last year, is canvassing American support to force the head of state, General Sani Abacha, to relinquish power to him.  The letter, diplomatic sources in Abuja told &quot;Newswatch&quot; last week, was part of Abiola's campaign abroad to undermine the federal military government in his quest for power snatched from within his grasp when the presidential election which he is believed to have won, was annulled by the former president, General Ibrahim Babangida.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola urged the Americans not to waver in their support for his presidential ambition &quot;until the battle is won and the Nigerian people are allowed to install the government of their own choice.&quot; He said that &quot;the people of Nigeria have totally rejected General Abacha's regime,&quot; adding, that the head of state thought that &quot;he could confuse the people of Nigeria and let them forget their desire for democracy,&quot; Abiola who referred to himself as president-elect told the Americans that contrary to expectations, when Abacha seized power November 17 last year and sacked the interim national government headed by Ernest Shonekan, he refused to hand over the government to him but instead &quot;enticed&quot; some of his supporters &quot;into his government, including my vice- president elect&quot; in order to &quot;achieve legitimacy and acknowledgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola has once again predicted bloodshed in the country, this time after the constitutional conference. The first time he predicted bloodshed for Nigeria was when he went abroad to campaign for sanctions against the country in the wake of the annulment of the presidential election. He had predicted then that if he was not sworn in as president on the departure of Babangida August 27, a combination of what was happening in Somalia and Bosnia would be a child's play compared to what would happen in Nigeria. He described the constitutional conference as an attempt by the government &quot;to throw dust into the eyes of Nigerians.&quot; Abiola also claimed that the conference had &quot;been rejected as a waste of time by the intellectuals, human rights organisations, the trade unions, the students, the market women and the masses of the Nigerian people.&quot; He said there was nothing wrong with the 1989 constitution which had not been tried. He went on: &quot;Even if a new constitution is promulgated, there can never be another election under it until the June 12 election is actualised.&quot; There must be sustained pressure to force out Abacha, he said, otherwise, the military would institute &quot;a long period of dictatorship&quot; in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola asked the president and the Congress men and women to continue to support the House of Concurrent Resolution 151 introduced by congressman Payne and passed by the house foreign affairs, Africa sub-committee. The resolution proposed stiffer economic and other sanctions against Nigeria.  Abiola said their support for the resolution &quot;would be a tremendous help toward the transition of power to the people's choice as president, in order to begin the long and difficult journey to economic stability and true democracy for Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Newswatch&quot; spoke on phone with an American in Washington DC who identified himself as Randall Echols who said he had been working for &quot;the president-elect Abiola&quot; on the Hill for some time now. He confirmed that the letter was written by Abiola and that it was published in &quot;Roll Call&quot;.  &quot;Newswatch&quot; has learnt that Abiola has a number of lobbyists working for him on the Hill. They issue periodic newsletters to Congress on Abiola&quot;s struggle for power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Newswatch&quot; gathered that Abacha was shown the letter and he instructed Kingibe to prepare an appropriate response &quot;to counter Abiola's propaganda.&quot; In his response dated March 21, Kingibe debunked Abiola's story.  He described the letter to the Americans as &quot;unfortunate and unnecessary.&quot; Kingibe went on to argue that it would be unwise for the US Congress to consider further sanctions against Nigeria because &quot;the wisdom and appropriateness of the current restrictions&quot; are questionable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kingibe, in what was obviously his first major public comment on the Abacha coup, confirmed it was staged with the support and connivance of the politicians. He admitted they invited the military to take-over the government once more because opposition to Shonekan had made it impossible for him to rule and the political crisis was deepening. He said when it became obvious that the Interim National Government, ING, no longer commanded the acceptance of Nigerians, most political leaders &quot;concluded that direct military intervention was the only way to stop the drift and create an enabling environment for the resumption of the democratisation process.&quot; He said that he and Abiola canvassed for military intervention and discussed this with various military officers including Abacha and Oladipo Diya, the chief of general staff, CGS. Said he: &quot;We were never assured that such an intervention would have restored the annulled June 12 presidential election.&quot; He explained that after the collapse of the ING, people &quot;who fought for democracy and the restoration of the June 12 election met with Abiola on November 21 where it was decided that they &quot;should cooperate with and participate in the new government to join if invited.&quot; He claimed also that Abiola stated during the meeting &quot;that anyone who wished to participate in the new government should feel free to serve if invited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kingibe said it was on the basis of this agreement that he, along with Olu Onagoruwa, a human right activist, Jonathan Zwingina, who was Abiola&quot;s campaign coordinator and other prominent supporters of the Abiola- Kingibe ticket including Jim Nwobodo, Abubakar Rimi, Ebenezer Babatope and Lateef Jakande joined the Abacha government. He said those who chose to serve did so because &quot;the interest of the country takes precedence over everything else, including my personal ambition. We believe that we should be in the best position to push the democratic agenda forward from within the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Abiola's opposition to the proposed constitutional conference, the minister said such opposition was unfounded. He said the expectation of Nigerians was that the conference would &quot;design a clear direction for building of a truly united nation as well as prepare the electoral calendar to end military rule.&quot; Assuring that the military government is bent on creating the enabling environment for dialogue on Nigeria's problems and aspirations, Kingibe added: &quot;Nigeria deserves the support of the American Congress, business community and other informed sectors of the American society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his reaction to Kingibe's letter, Abiola told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that he was surprised that a confidential letter between friends could find its way into the news media. He promised to give a detailed reply to it this week.  He, however, denied that he approved of the military take-over or the appointments of Kingibe and other leading members of the SDP into Abacha&quot;s cabinet. He admitted that he was with Abacha on the night of the coup but denied submitting a list of ministerial nominees to him. Said he: &quot;When I was about to leave, Abacha asked me what I thought of his appointing Kingibe into his cabinet. I laughed. Kingibe never mentioned anything to me about his being considered for appointment until it was announced. He then came to my house to apologise to me. He told me that while waiting for June 12, some of them were finding it difficult to maintain their homes. I expected him to stand by me or resign. He didn't. Disbanding the political parties has nothing to do with the mandate given to me on June 12.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola maintained that at the meeting of SDP leaders in his house after the coup, all of the agreed to stand by June 12. &quot;I am a democrat. If they had said June 12 was dead, I would have abided by their decision. But nobody said so,&quot; Abiola said. He told &quot;Newswatch&quot; he believed Kingibe took up his appointment to maintain his family. &quot;Democrats see him as a turncoat. In the politics of poverty that we have in this country, some people will rather rule in hell than serve in heaven&quot; Abiola said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He maintained his stand on June 12 and wondered how anyone would expect him to support Abacha. &quot;It is rubbish. Abacha's government is not a legal government. It is another contraption like the interim national government. I abide by the mandate of my supporters. I am not part of the cabal that wants the military. Military government is a form of slavery for Nigeria. My position on this is clear. But if they call for a dialogue, I am prepared,&quot; Abiola concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The letter was delivered to each member of Congress by the Nigerian embassy in Washington. &quot;Newswatch&quot; gathered that the federal government would intensify its lobby to prevent the Congress from &quot;being taken in&quot; by Abiola. Foreign ministry officials said last week that the letters would destroy whatever links existed between Abiola and Kingibe, his former running mate. Said the source: &quot;It was never hidden, the animosity between the two men as a result of the presidential nomination which Abiola won. This will be the final break between them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFRICA NEWS SERVICE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On a continent better known for famines and failures than for successes, Africans may finally have something to boast about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A low-budget peacekeeping force composed of soldiers from eight other troubled African countries appears to be showing the United Nations a thing or two about stopping war. The success of the force that is bringing peace to this West African nation after four years of civil war could serve as an example for other trouble spots where U.N.-dominated operations have foundered, observers say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If you look at all the dismal flops in Somalia, Angola, Yugoslavia and elsewhere, it might be heartening to see some hope,&quot; said one diplomat, who asked not to be named.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russia has already looked at the African peacekeeping model for ways to settle the conflict in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, said Trevor Gordon- Somers, the Jamaican-born U.N. special envoy to Liberia who has been brokering the peace process with a stubborn determination that has won him few friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the U.N. is backing the operation, it was the 15,000 African peacekeepers who enforced the U.N. embargo against rebel leader Charles Taylor in November 1992 and defeated him on the battlefield under the leadership of a series of Nigerian generals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African peacekeeping force, backed by about 360 U.N. military observers, began disarming Liberia's fighters two weeks ago in line with a peace accord the factions signed last July to end the fighting that has claimed 150,000 lives. In addition, a new transitional ruling council representing a spectrum of political and ethnic groups was inaugurated and a transitional legislature installed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, problems remain. The factions have yet to agree on choices to head the government's four key ministries -- finance, foreign affairs, justice and defense -- and the political impasse is slowing disarmament. Two weeks after fighters began handing in their weapons, only about 1,500 soldiers out of an estimated 45,000 have been demobilized. Most belong to Taylor's National Patriotic Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, splinter groups of fighters have emerged from each of the three factions that signed the peace accord. Taylor has manipulated the attacks, portraying himself as the innocent victim, a move that could win him support at the ballot box in presidential elections scheduled for September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After an eight-month advance on the capital, Taylor had nearly tasted victory in 1990. The rebel leader sat for a month across the street from the presidential mansion, but was unable to deliver a final blow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This war was prolonged when the decision was taken that Charles Taylor had to be stopped by the West African community because taking power would mean instability in the West African region,&quot; Taylor complained to reporters recently. &quot;I was...waiting to take Monrovia within hours when I was asked to cease fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now recent positive developments have bolstered the nation's hope that the fighting -- which was marked by two particularly heinous massacres of groups of 600 and 700 civilians and the slaughter of five American nuns -- will soon end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the backing of the Economic Community of West African States, the peacekeepers installed an interim government. It ruled over a relatively calm but bullet- scarred Monrovia -- until Taylor attacked the capital in October 1992, reigniting the war and drawing the peacekeepers into battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regional force was recently reinforced with troops from Tanzania and Uganda, largely to appease Taylor who has refused to give up his weapons to the Nigerians because of their country's longstanding ties to Doe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the peacekeepers have been able to step in where Western observers failed. For example, when a power struggle within the leadership of one of the factions appeared to threaten disarmament, the peacekeepers and local elders cam e together to resolve the dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It shows that we cannot continue to depend on the United Nations,&quot; said Nigerian Maj. Gen. John Inienger, the peacekeeping field commander.  &quot;There is more cohesiveness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers, however, note that the peacekeeping effort is not entirely altruistic. Sierra Leone, for instance, was eager to stop the war that had spilled over its border. And many officers in the peacekeeping force are engaged in lucrative business ventures that exploit Liberia's resources of timber, diamonds, rubber and gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regional troops also participated in the looting of Monrovia's suburbs in 1992. Refrigerators, air conditioners and other goods were later shipped back to their own countries. And Nigerian fighter planes bombed hospitals, aid convoys and food warehouses during the peak enforcement period of the embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it was that embargo which was the key to bringing about the recent peace, observers say, and its execution by the African peacekeepers is an example of how the U.N. can more effectively carry out its mandate without becoming too involved as it has in Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will stay here until elections,&quot; said Kenyan Maj., Gen. Daniel Opande, the chief U.N. military observer in Liberia. &quot;But come elections, the day after the installation of the government, I don't think we will stay here even one day longer than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African Development Foundation (ADF) is a public enterprise set up in 1980 by the US Congress to support self-development initiatives by African populations. The major goal is to provide the resources needed by African grassroots populations to reach self-reliant development. ADF does not impose external development concepts on African communities. Instead, it encourages Africans to suggest innovative approaches to problem-solving, which will eventually lead to self-reliance and self-sufficiency in the local communities. Researchers are requested to explore problems directly related to grassroots development and to make concrete recommendations that can be of assistance to development project promoters in the community. ADF provides grants for research initiated and conducted by African academics, development specialists, students and community groups. Researchers are encouraged to be creative in selecting their theme and to focus their research on issues which are crucial to the development of their countries. In 1994, ADF will allocate approximately US $675,000 to research project funding. Four types of fellowships will be awarded: Gray postgraduate fellowships (deadline August 1, 1994); Be applied research fellowships (deadline August 1, 1994); Grants for transfer of knowledge (no deadline); Leland development fellowships (deadline January 1, 1995).

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six environmental heroes from around the world received the fifth annual Goldman Environmental Prizes on April 18 at a ceremony in San Francisco. Each of the 1994 Goldman Environmental Prize winners receives a &quot;no strings attached&quot; award of $60,000 from the Goldman Environmental Foundation of San Francisco.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only 1994 winner from Africa was Laila Kamel (Cairo, Egypt)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Volunteer Director of the Association for the Protection of the Environment (APE), Laila Kamel, 46, has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of Cairo's garbage collector population. Fleeing drought in the 1940's, whole villages migrated to Cairo from rural Southern Egypt. Unskilled and uneducated, they became garbage collectors of 'zabbaleen', eking out their livelihood collecting the household waste of the city's 16 million inhabitants and living amidst mountains of garbage on the outskirts of the city in the Mokattam Hills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> APE has pioneered several recycling projects in the garbage collector community with the goal of helping them turn &quot;trash into cash.&quot; At the neighborhood composting plant, organic waste is refined into high-grade fertilizer and sold to agriculturalists. Metals are melted and reworked. And at Laila Kamel's Rug-Weaving Center, garbage collector girls turn &quot;rags into riches.&quot; Using cotton remnants, girls learn to weave rugs on a hand-loom. The colorful rugs are later sold at handicraft fairs, and earnings are divided among the aspiring weavers. While learning to weave, the girls learn basic math and literacy skills. Each year 150 girls participate in this &quot;learning and earning&quot; project. Those who graduate from Kamel's program have the option of receiving a loom for their home to start their own cottage industry.  Kamel's center has brought opportunity to young women, most of whom would otherwise spend their days sorting garbage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SUDAN DEMOCRATIC GAZETTE, April 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 28 February the Egyptian foreign minister, Amero Musa, told the Arabic newspaper 'Al Hayat' of London that Egypt was totally against the right of the Southern Sudanese people to Self-determination and would never allow such a right to be exercised. He told the paper that Egyptian officials were in contact with the Khartoum regime to co-ordinate their efforts on how best to prevent such an eventuality. In addition, he revealed that Egypt was consulting other Arab countries in order to establish a common policy on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been clear for decades that Egypt does not act as an impartial neighbour when it comes to discussing the Sudanese conflict, in spite of the occasional overtures of goodwill towards the South, intended to fool the South into complacency. Ever since Sudan's independence in 1956, Egypt has sided with the Northern power elite in Khartoum against the South. Its interests have concerned the Nile waters rather than the people of Sudan, and so protection of those waters has been paramount in all its interactions with Khartoum.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The worst intentions of Cairo have become clearer over the past four years as it has singularly failed to take any stance against the most repressive regime Sudan has ever suffered. This is despite the presence of millions of Sudanese refugees in Egypt. Now it appears that Cairo hopes it can win over Khartoum by adopting a strong anti-Southern Sudanese stance.  Even if it succeeds, it will make little difference to the struggle of the Southerners because Egypt has never been one of their supporters. Most Southerners have always assumed that ultimately Egypt's power would be utilised by their oppressors in the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not too surprising to the people of Southern Sudan that Egypt has kept quiet and condoned all of the atrocities, killings and torture committed by Khartoum, only to speak out so strongly and so clearly today against the political interests of the South. Egypt may well be right that at present it will run no risks of repercussions for such a policy, in the face of a weak South bereft of external allies. However, it is definitely a serious political miscalculation as far as Egypt's long term prospects are concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is interesting that Cairo has chosen to deal with an African problem by referring it to Arab countries. This is in spite of President Mubarak being at this present moment the chairperson of the Organisation for African Unity (OAU). Other African states will note only too clearly where Egypt's real allegiance stands. Egypt is merely demonstrating the contempt with which it holds the rest of black Africa. The Egyptian authorities have not given a moment's thought to the peace initiative launched by the IGADD nations to find an African solution to an African problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Egypt's intervention in the debate is intended to negatively influence the pro-Egyptian parties of Northern Sudan against Self-determination, it is the 'Gazette's' sincere hope that some of these parties will see through the Egyptian position and realise that it is based on pure self-interest and not even the interests of the North. Only a Sudanese solution will resolve the conflict and that has to be based upon the wishes of the people and the execution of a referendum on Self-determination in the South. One wonders how much the North now regrets today's problems should have been avoided, including the exodus of Northern Sudanese into Egypt who are now being used as a political lever by Cairo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The call for Self-determination is both genuine and serious. It will not be sacrificed simply because the North now has the overt backing of Egypt. Self-determination for the South is now the only way open for the North to atone for its past crimes in the South. If that means the creation of a separate Southern Sudanese state, then so be it. The South will not be denied a free political choice. The 'Gazette' hopes that the representatives of the North will soon realize that Egyptian interference can only have a negative impact both upon themselves and the South. Whilst the Southern Sudanese accept external help in the mediation process, they will never accept the dictates of an external power concerning what is essentially a Sudanese problem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, March 29-31, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The venue is Lukolo village. The time is March 8, 1994. It is indeed a great day for the villagers who, for the first time have been honoured with the presence of big people from the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It came both as a surprise and like some sort of a joke when word started going round that in the whole of that district, Lukolo had been selected venue for the International Women's Day celebrations. Men were fast mobilised to oversee the preparations for this occasion. There were mixed feelings of anger, suspicion and anxiety among the males and minimal awareness among the females.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some men were particularly excited and looked forward to hear for themselves about this international madness of women.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Men like Kyasanku would not miss this opportunity to hear what these confused women from town had to say. He prepared to question them on why they thought, in this 21st century, water would start flowing uphill. However, if the worse came to the worst, these women might end up getting some disciplinary action from Lukolo men in their own husbands have stubbornly refused to dispense the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, some of the more reactionary type went as far as sending a high powered delegation to their RC II Chairman for clarification on &quot;activities threatening the stability of Lukolo homes&quot;. The RC man was cautioned that should anything go wrong he would be responsible and should therefore, expect a vote of no confidence and a probable banishment from Lukolo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anyway after long persuasion by the RC boss, tempers cooled down and for three complete weeks arrangements were amicably made for the 'great day'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kyasanku with four of his friends volunteered to put up a giant shed (ekidaala) and also took charge of the preparation of the local brew. Fro tarpaulins, banana leaves would do. The cutting and delivery of these materials to the ground was assigned to the women and children. This group would also cut grass and spread it in the shed when time came.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of who would attend the function was seriously debated. One group of men felt that as usual it was the men and their adolescent sons. The other group felt that they would allow some unmarried women (old girls) and widows and school children for their entertainment role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others had heard that this was a women's function. Women's function?  Whose wives were to be left to loiter just like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well, at the end of it all it was agreed that all women be given permission to attend; but with strict instructions to stick to singing and dancing to entertain the visitors. They were not to ask any questions and they would leave the venue as and when their husbands felt it was time they went to attend to their domestic roles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All drinking places were full of discussions about their 'day'. Men wondered what this Women's Day meant. Was it to instill town madness into their women? Was it an exchange of roles between men and women for that day?  Was it a revolution against culture? Many wondered how their good government allowed these women who had nothing to do in town, do it in Lukolo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The long awaited day came. The shed had been erected in the best way possible to reflect the excitement of the day. It was quite big. The men arrived in large numbers and much earlier than the women who had to attend to the family duties first. The men got comfortably seated in the chairs available. The atmosphere was general expectant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When they finally arrived, women shyly got their places on the dry grass, behind the men. Theirs was a mixture of uncertainty and fear. They talked among themselves in murmurs and occasionally a suppressed laughter was head here and there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The high table (on the side of the hosts) was mostly occupied by men apart from one RC lady who, from the look on her face, was far from comfortable. The school children and the women groups that were assigned to entertain the visitors were seated in one of the front corners, ready and waiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The awaited guests from town arrived. Formal welcome was done and immediately the day's programme started. The RC I Secretary for Women's welcome speech was short, simple and was just bare truth. The Lukolo women were happy to see their counterparts from town. They were still the women like their grandmothers had been, and they were all ears to hear what fellow women from town had to tell the. With those few remarks, she invited the chief lady guest to address the gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lady maximally used this opportunity to educate the gathering on the political economy, the economics of development of Uganda and the rate at which the Ugandan woman had lagged behind in as far as participation was concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She laboured to bring it to her audience's notice that even the returns a woman in this land got for her contribution towards national development were so meagre. She elaborately discussed the women's marginal propensity to save and all that went with it. Finally, the guest of honour handled this question of the population explosion and its effects on the economy of the country, and therefore, the ordinary woman in Lukolo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anyway, most of her talk seemed too hard for the Lukolo women to comprehend. But, at the end of it all, the women felt they somehow had their own view on limiting the family sizes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the visitors had been treated to all sorts of entertainment in form of songs, plays, poems and 11 types of dances including the 'Runyege, Bwola' and 'Nankasa' they bid farewell with a promise to pay another visit in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Life went back to normal in Lukolo and as the women went to their gardens to collect food for supper, others to the wells, and the rest to collect firewood; the discussion in small groups of three nor four centred on this 'family limit'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were a number of questions that the Lukolo ladies asked themselves. &quot;Has anyone ever realised that a village woman digs for the whole family, fetches water, looks for firewood, mends all the family clothes, attends to all the sick people in the home, plans for the family nutrition, nurses the baby and attends to her husband's endless needs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fair as it is to get fewer numbers, how does a village woman go about all the domestic chores without the help of her dear 'little ones'? At least if each child collects a sauce-panful of water, by the end of five rounds to the well, they will have filled a big drum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When you send them to the forest, if each one comes back with a small dry branch, that is already enough firewood to make a meal. How then could a Lukolo woman afford to limit herself to only; one girl. Girls age very quickly. Who will help around the house if she got married?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The good ladies further examined the fact that in many homes, husbands are shared. The only way one proves to her co-wife that the husband still loves her is by getting a child after another. Otherwise, the co-wife may think you have been long abandoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, in this locality, a woman's company is only guaranteed among her children. Men here, quickly realise the necessity to search for better company. The only company these poor women are left with is their children who will never find 'another mom'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another point raised was that the children of theses days are very unreliable behaviour wise. They do not hesitate to become disobedient. The ladies feared limiting themselves to one to two, to avoid disappointment at the end of the day when these few proved nuisances. This would be very regrettable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All in all, the Lukolo ladies only wish to wake up one morning and find that better technology has come nearer or even into their homes; food production and preparation has become less taxing on their time and energy; and they also feel that their scope is rather wide (mother-doctor-nurse-electrician-nutritionist-transporter-farmer...). A reduction in these roles, would allow them room to specialise, in some few.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOUTH, April 1-5, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Goldstone Commission's revelation of prima facie evidence that top police officers have been behind the hideous violence that has soaked this country in blood is no surprise to reporters who have covered the carnage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newspapers such as &quot;The Weekly Mail&quot; and &quot;Vrye Weekblad&quot;, and foreign correspondents such as John Carlin of &quot;The Independent&quot;, have published mountains of evidence pointing to police collaboration with Inkatha in the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have disclosed details of Vlakplaas and the CCB, of hit squads and gun-running and secret training bases in Natal and Caprivi. The fact that no prosecutions resulted from any of this pointed ineluctably to high-level intervention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have seen and heard enough to be in no doubt about police involvement in the violence. As long ago as August 29, 1990, after covering a series of attacks in the East Rand and the Vaal Triangle, I wrote in my column: &quot;Ask any reporter who has been in the townships through the mayhem of the past few weeks and he will recount instances of police bias in favour of the Inkatha fighters that he has witnessed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was Inkathagate in July 1991, when it was revealed police had paid Inkatha R250 000 to help it counter the ANC; the Trust Feeds trial which exposed police action in carrying out a political massacre in Natal and Goldstone's raid in November, 1992, on a renegade Military Intelligence element carrying out anti-ANC operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The accumulation of evidence is formidable. Now we have to look at the political implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, it is clear we cannot build a new South Africa without restructuring the police force. The authorities can't go on offering the excuse of &quot;a few rotten apples&quot; in a force that is basically sound. The rot is at the top. The police must be given a new command structure, starting with the commissioner who has himself been named as a major obstructionist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That brings us to political responsibility. At the head of the queue of answerable figures is Minister of Law and Order Hernus Kriel. If he knew what was going on in the upper echelons of the police force for which he was responsible, then he is as culpable as his generals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If he did not, he is incompetent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Either way he should go. That is the principal of cabinet responsibility honoured in all democracies. It has never been heeded by the Nat government, but we keep hearing this is a new NP committed to democracy.  Whether Kriel stays or goes is a litmus test of that claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even more important than Kriel's resignation from an expiring cabinet is that he should be withdrawn as the NP's candidate for premier in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is the one region the NP could win in the election, and it is unthinkable that its leadership might go to someone who may bear responsibility, albeit vicariously, for the terrible violence that has ravaged the country. If the NP wants to play a constructive role in building the new South Africa, it cannot have that as its cornerstone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next in the responsibility queue is Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a man who has long proclaimed himself to be the champion of non-violent methods of political struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said at the time of the Inkathagate scandal that he knew nothing about the payment of the security police money to his organisation. It happened without the knowledge of this man who is the dominant figure in his party and whom associates say has a personal hand in even its smallest decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now we are told the chief minister and Police Minister knew nothing about the gun-running to his own police force, through a Commissioner of Police seconded to him from the South African security police, at Judge Goldstone has revealed. A state of sublime ignorance pervades the entire IFP national executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Goldstone carefully points out the case has not been proven in court. But the prima facie evidence is there. The wheels of justice move slowly, but the political pace is running much faster and the Zulu people are going to decide how they feel about the evidence and who may have been responsible for instigating the most terrible civil war in their history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then there is President de Klerk. It is hardly conceivable that he could have been involved in trying to destabilise the process he initiated and on which his whole reputation depends, yet at the very least he has been naive in failing to heed the warnings that there were malevolent forces at work in the security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Time and time again his response was &quot;bring me the evidence&quot;, as though the possibility of systematic covering up of evidence within the police force never occurred to him. With an innocence that belies his political experience, he expected the police to investigate themselves &quot;to the bone&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Did he not know, or did he not want to know? That question remains unanswerable at this point. What is certain, though is that Goldstone's report blows to pieces the NP's claim to be the one party that has kept South Africa on a stable course through this transition period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scale of what has happened must not be forgotten. A total of 13 500 people have died in political violence since February, 1990.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HOW THE ELECTIONS WILL WORK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike the U.S. electoral system where voters select individual candidates, the election in South Africa will be based on a system of proportional representation. Under a system of proportional representation, voters are required to select the part and not the individual or their choice. Voters leave it to the parties to select the individuals who will represent them in the legislature. In South Africa, the process will work as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The National Assembly will have 400 seats. Also at the national level, there will be a 90-member Senate composed of 10 representatives from each of the nine provinces. There will also be provincial legislatures which will vary in size according to the size of the electorate in each province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Parties will hold nomination conferences at which they compile nomination lists for national and regional legislatures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * In developing the national lists, parties will be required to submit a combination of one national and nine regional lists. In particular, a single list of 200 names would be submitted as the party's &quot;national list&quot; and nine lists, each containing names drawn from specific regions would be presented as &quot;regional lists&quot;. Regional lists for the National Assembly are not to be confused with separate lists for the regional legislatures. So each party will submit a total of 19 lists - 1 &quot;national list&quot; (for the National Assembly); 9 &quot;regional lists) (for the National Assembly) and 9 lists for the provincial legislatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * However, the voter's only concern will be which party he or she prefers. In particular, the ballot form will list the names of all parties taking part in the election. Next to each party name will be the symbol identified with that party and a photograph of the party leader. The voter will be asked to place and &quot;X&quot; next to the party of his or her choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * A single balloting system will be used to elect both the National Assembly and the Provincial legislatures. The Provincial legislatures, once composed, would elect the 90-member Senate. If a dual balloting system had been chosen, a voter could select one party for the &quot;national&quot; portion of the National Assembly and another party for the regional portion of the National Assembly and the provincial legislature. Many of the parties advocating for the dual balloting system have strong support in certain regions but do not have a strong national following.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * After the votes are tallied, parties will be awarded seats in the National Assembly and Provincial legislatures that are reflective of the share of votes they got in the elections. So if there are 400 seats in the National Assembly and a party receives half of all votes cast in the election, that party would be entitled to seat the first 100 nominees appearing on its &quot;national list&quot; and the first half of the nominees appearing on each of the &quot;regional lists&quot; in the National Assembly. Similarly, that party would receive half of the seats in the Provincial legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Nomination lists are required to be prepared in priority order. So if a party's share of votes translates into 3 seats in the National Assembly, the first three names appearing on the nomination list will be chosen to fill the seats. Because of this requirement, the women's lobby in South Africa has secured an agreement from the negotiating parties that not only must nomination lists include a minimum of one-third women, a female candidate will be required to appear in every third position on the nomination lists.  Women advocates were concerned that parties would try to satisfy the one-third requirement by placing all of its female candidates at the bottom of their lists, thereby reducing female candidates' chances of gaining seats in the legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Once in place, the National Assembly will choose a Cabinet and President. The combination of the National Assembly and the Senate will form a &quot;Constitutional Assembly&quot; whose sole purpose will be to draft a permanent constitution for South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following parties will participate in the elections in April:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sports Organisation for Collective Contributions and Equal Rights (SOCCER)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reprinted by the DAILY OBSERVER from THE VISION, (Freetown, Sierra Leone), March 3-10, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a contradiction for the NPRC to proclaim the slogan &quot;Power to the People&quot; while restricting ownership of the independent press to vested and monied interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The press is a source of information, a forum for discussion and circulation of ideas amongst the people. Who owns and controls the media should be of concern not just to journalists, but to the entire society. In a period of democratic transition it is a vital political question!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Limiting ownership of newspapers to proprietors with at least Le6 million in assets is to deny access and control of the media to the vast majority of our people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Journalists, teachers, workers, small business people, etc., do not have those kind of resources. The sectors which do are usually those people with vested financial interests or selfish political objectives to promote and protect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Who will control the nation's papers after the new &quot;guidelines&quot; take effect? Mining companies which rape our environment but want to manipulate public relations? Lebanese businessmen with shady deals to defined? Ex-APC politicians seeking a new political lease of life?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly most small papers owned and run by journalists and reflecting a wide diversity of social orientation and views will not survive the Le6 million hurdle posed by the new &quot;guidelines&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even papers which do find a sponsor will be at the mercy of the proprietors' interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 'New Breed' for example lost its proprietor and its licence when its proprietor gained political office. The concept of editorial independence will certainly be sacrificed to political and financial ambition if the new &quot;guidelines&quot; are left in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the NPRC slogan &quot;Power to the People&quot; is to be applied to information policy then it should translate itself into state support for the widest possible circulation of information and the broadest possible collective ownership of the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NPRC could promote, through training and funding, co-operative ownership of papers by journalists, women's groups, trade unions and youth movements, for example. The neglected rural masses could be exposed to literacy campaigns and the outside world by local papers in our national languages, through co-cooperation between government, NGOs and the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists (SLAJ).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These and many other innovations can be achieved provided the NPRC regime is really committed to putting information in the hands of the people.  A revolutionary and democratic information policy is desperately needed at this time in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let us understand, with out needless hypocrisy, that the present policy is neither revolutionary or democratic. Indeed the reactionary and backward nature of these &quot;guidelines&quot; is clearly apparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For many years now the so-called &quot;elite&quot; has been complaining about an &quot;irresponsible&quot; press. By that they meant a press which uncovered their crooked contracts, exposed their fake academic degrees and generally snooped and interfered while this APC &quot;elite&quot; ran the country into bankruptcy. Some people even present the case as if journalists are the one responsible for the massive looting of national resources, smuggling shameful neglect of the masses' interests and all the major ills of this country since independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To control the press, make it more &quot;responsible&quot; (i.e. prevent it exposing their terrible crimes to the masses) -- this reactionary cabal used political licensing of papers, the 1980 Newspaper Act, detention, bogus libel charges, bribery and ultimately violence during the period 1968 - 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sierra Leone press today has been negatively affected by these measures. However, whatever ills afflict the press are the result not of too little, but too much government interference.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Letter to the Editor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Editor,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Government and people of Sierra Leone view with dismay your fabricated and is leading editorial of Thursday February 24, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is true that the NPRC &quot;promised to redeem the Sierra Leonean people from the corruption and oppression of the regime of President Momoh and his ruling All People's Congress (APC), which had dominated the country since 1968.&quot; This is well on course as the promise is steadily being made good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What happened on December 29k, 1992 was an event in the Revolution that emancipated the people of this country and brought to a logical conclusion 24 years of APC misrule and depravity. The rest should be left to historians and posterity to judge and give a verdict within the context of our socio-economic and political achievements in due course. You should not adopt an inquisitorial attitude in this matter, offensively prying into what you are ill-informed about, and assuming the role of a prosecutor and judge at the same time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your editorial failed woefully to give the true picture of the cordial relationship between the NPRC and the press in Sierra Leone. You may want to communicate your views directly to the press as they are keen to know your source of misinformation about the unrelated matters you raised in the editorial. The following is a resolution recently passed by the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists (SLAJ) on the issue of newspaper registration/re-registration and guidelines:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The press is fully in support of the NPRC's anti-corruption and revolutionary objectives. SLAJ sees itself as a partner in progress, a contributor to national development and a key institution in this period of democratic transition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We therefore deprecate any attempt to put a wedge between us by detractors. It is our nation that comes first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your assumption that newspapers were shut down and journalists jailed because they criticised the Chairman and Head of State was again fallacious and misleading. The truth of the matter is that when we had a mushrooming of newspapers and leaflets, there was a sudden emergence of cheque-book journalists everywhere, blackmailing law abiding and peaceful citizens. They were soon found out by heir own association -- SLAJ. One of these miscreant journalists was your Chernor Ojuku Sesay. His conduct was found to be inconsistent with the practices and ethics of the profession and he was consequently banned from practicing journalism for five years by his own association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Sesay submitted a public apology for some false allegations he made in his paper against an innocent citizen, which caused this citizen considerable torment. It is government's responsibility to protect its citizens. It is in the light of this that guidelines are usually provided as safeguards for the protection of our citizens against unscrupulous journalists and reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paul Kamara simply did not apply for registration. No one arbitrarily closed his paper. It was his own decision not to print against. The 'New Citizen' was neither &quot;closed&quot; under decree 6 nor because of what your paper referred to as &quot;irresponsible reporting&quot;. The editor was ordered to appear in court for publishing a newspaper without an imprint showing the name of the editor, proprietor and contact address. The implications for this act of omission you would agree would be far-reaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the issue of press guidelines the purpose is not to muzzle the press as you conjectured. An objective analysis could have highlighted the advantages these guidelines would generate. Among other things, high standards of journalism and responsible practices would be enhanced. Most of the editors of the newspapers in question have accepted these guidelines as sensible and reasonable. Government is still encouraging dialogue on the matter. Meanwhile, registration of newspapers is well under way.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Editorial, DAILY OBSERVER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Captain Valentine Strasser and his National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) are typical aren't they?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When they seized power in a military coup in April 1992, they promised to redeem the Sierra Leonean people from the corruption and oppression of the regime of President Momoh and his ruling All People's Congress (APC), which had dominated the country since 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But like all military leaders before him, and like so many civilian African leaders, Capt. Strasser and his group have, once tasting power, wasted no time in mobilising all the powers of the state -- and even the power which the state does not justly have -- against innocent and helpless people and institutions and, as a result, against the country as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This young soldier of only 28 years first shocked the world when he ordered the summary execution of 26 alleged coup plotters. Then he moved on the press, jailing and summarily shutting down the offices of any journalist who would dare to be critical of any of his brutal and ruthless acts. By mid 1993, barely a year after he seized power, most of the country's 31 newspapers had disappeared, leaving only 11, and these were also in a state of siege, thanks to the draconian laws instituted against the press.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under one of the laws, called Decree 6, the 'New Citizen' newspaper was closed in late 1993 for what the information ministry called &quot;irresponsible reporting&quot;. Its only crime: an editorial critical of the government's human rights record. Paul Kamara, editor of 'For Di People', who was invited by UNESCO in 1991 to attend the Windhoek Seminar on an Independent and Pluralistic Press in Africa, was jailed and his newspaper was closed. Earlier, Chernor Ojuku Sesay, editor of 'The Pool' newspaper, had been summoned by Lt. Solomon Musa, the then vice chairman of the NPRC, and brutally beaten until he became unconscious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now the Strasser government has come up with a new set of measures to control journalists and newspapers. Publishers now wishing to re-register their newspapers have to deposit one million leones as collateral and must have assets valued at a minimum of five million leones. The Sierra Leonean Association of Journalists (SLAJ) has quite naturally, strongly criticised these measures, aptly describing them as 'primitive, illegal and repressive and an interference' in press matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a country where less than 60 per cent of the population is literate, and whose economy, owing to over three decades of graft, corruption and mismanagement, has long been all but bankrupt, where in the world is a newspaper expected to raise that kind of money?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By attempting to muzzle the press, Strasser is employing the same old tactic that has led many African nations to chaos and destruction. For he seems not to realise that the media are the only link between himself and the people he claims to be serving. When he muzzles the press, he muzzles his people also, and creates a state of fear and trepidation in the country. But for how long?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How long does he think he can run away from truth -- that stubborn, indomitable, immovable originator and monitor of all human and natural substances and events in the universe? Can Strasser run away from God? He is Truth Personified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We submit that Mr. Strasser is too young for that. If he really loves his people and wants them to love him in return, he should leave them alone to express their opinions about anything in the country, including the way their government is run. How else can he know how well -- or how badly -- he is doing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the end, the press would be his friend, not his enemy; for it is the one instrument in society which can tell him the truth -- the truth that can surely make him and the country free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nothing else can, certainly not his guns and bayonets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH, April 11, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following are excerpts from an interview in 'Newswatch' magazine with Brigadier-General David Mark, a former government minister under President Ibrahim Babangida. He is one of 17 senior officers who were forcibly retired in November after General Sani Abacha ousted the interim civilian-led administration that was appointed to run the country following Babangida's resignation in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the interview was published earlier this month, the Abacha government reacted angrily. Ray Ekpu, founding editor of 'Newswatch', was detained, along with four other journalists from the magazine: names. Ekpu, who was on vacation when Agbese was arrested on April 8, was himself picked up at Calabar airport, in the east of the country, when he arrived to fly to Lagos to assist his colleagues. All were released on April 18 and charges were dropped. The magazine and the detainees have sued the government for damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: It is said that you were involved with the military's return to power on November 17 with General Abacha as head of state. What do you say to that if indeed as you said you are for democracy?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark: It is not yet time for me to say who was involved and who played what role but suffice to say for now that Abacha's regime qualifies for a space in the Guinness Book of Records as the greatest betrayal of the century. It is a betrayal of the military officers involved, it is a betrayal of the CD (Campaign for Democracy) and CLO (Civil Liberties Organisation) people and it is a betrayal of hope and aspirations for all Nigerians. It is a betrayal of democracy. It was not a coup against the ING but as it turned out it was a coup against democracy; supported and nourished by politicians who behave like chameleons. Surprisingly it was Abiola's close associates who were urging Abacha to take over. They dined with Abiola in the afternoon but in the night urged Abacha to seize power and forget June 12. I never believed that human beings could be so treacherous, unprincipled, and shameless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: Can you elaborate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark: It is a betrayal because what the administration is doing now is the exact opposite of what we agreed and what we set out to do. It is a complete turn around. I am so disappointed that I had to write a letter to General Diya on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: What happened?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark: When we saw that things were getting out of control in the country and it had become obvious that the interim government could not hold an election and the ship of state was drifting precariously, we reluctantly decided that the military should again intervene. When we met we considered three possible options. The first option was to give Shonekan and his team the teeth to be able to bite and conduct the presidential election successfully as was in the transition programme. The second option was to go for a short but full military regime for six months and conduct only; th presidential election thereafter. And the third option was a mixed grill, a diluted military regime for no more than one year, culminating again in a presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of us favoured option one for obvious reason. We believed that Nigeria at that time, was not in the mood for a military regime. People were no longer prepared to tolerate the military. In addition, most of us were acutely aware that the entire world was moving toward democracy. The dramatic effects of the last few years -- the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the rise of democratic movements are around the world clearly galvanised that point. Besides we had covered considerable distance in out tortuous march towards democracy; to do otherwise would amount to reversing the hand of the clock. The CD and CLO had gained so much popularity that it would be difficult for the military to rule effectively without bloodshed. The military had been seriously fragmented, disgraced and politicised so much so that Nigerians no longer trusted its impartiality nor respected its air of authority. The military needed to return to the barracks to put its house in order, and address the much neglected welfare problems of the troops. Sadly, our soldiers live in slums. They are totally ill equipped and untrained, in spite of all the money gulped buy the Ministry of Defence. The reasons for these were no far fetched. It was an open secret among soldiers and soldiers' wives, unfortunately, to the embarrassment of the officers, whose conditions were not nay better. These, amongst other, informed our decision in favour of option one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: How were you to accomplish this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark: We were to accomplish option one by openly telling the nation that the military was strongly behind Shonekan and his team in their effort to complete the transition programme successfully. General Abacha was to make the announcement and warn the State Governments that were not cooperating that they risked being removed and state of emergency being declared in their states. We were to be emphatic and unequivocal in our support for Shonekan and his team. But surprisingly the Governors did not want Shonekan to succeed. They made Abacha's home their pilgrimage point and urged Abacha to take over power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second option was a short full fledged military regime for six months -- we discarded this for obvious reasons, some of which I have already told you. This option presented more problems than we could handle at that time. The problems included possible economic sanctions from the western world, head on collision with the international monetary and financial institutions; if at that late stage in our march towards democracy we returned to military government attain, it would completely undermine our leadership role in the African continent. And more importantly there was the possibility of being disgraced out of office by a civilian uprising. We were not even sure that the soldiers in the barracks who had also witnessed the move toward democracy around the world, would be supportive. Why should they anyway when their condition is worse off in a military regime? And we realised sadly too that the solution to our economic and political problem could not be solved by simple military decree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third option, which was a longer one, was a diluted military arrangement for no more than one year. Within this one year we were to conduct al the elections from local government chairmanship to the presidential. After all, Obasanjo and Yar'Adua did their elections in one year therefore there was no reason why we could not have done the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all the three options, there were a few constants. The two political parties were to remain, although they could be renamed it the politicians so desired, government was to stop funding the political parties.  Parties were to fund themselves, the parties were not to be treated as government parastatals. The parties were to refund N100 million each back to the government. Independent candidacy was to be allowed in all the elections and as much as possible each of the two political parties was to nominate a southern presidential candidate for obvious reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: By southern Presidential candidate do you mean a Yoruba?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark: No not necessarily, I mean a candidate from the southern part of Nigeria. He could be Igbo or any southern minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: You did not appear to have settled on any of the three options. What we now have bears no resemblance to all the careful calculations. What happened?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark: Yes we did settle on an option. At the end of a stormy debate, we favoured option one while General Abacha and Diya favoured option three with modification in the duration. Abacha and Diya wanted the regime to remain in power for a minimum of five years and a maximum of eight years. The younger officers in the group objected vehemently because they maintained, and rightly so, that it would be impossible to sell Abacha to the nation or the international community for one day let along five years. They maintained that it was impossible to separate Abacha from Babangida. This marked the beginning of a major disagreement within the group. Eventually, General Abacha and Diya reluctantly agreed but with the proviso that Diya &quot;would sound out the CD, CLO, Yoruba leaders of thought, the elders, and the Obas to see if option three would be acceptable.&quot; Diya confirmed that he sent Onagoruwa to meet the Ala'afin and to tell him that the Ooni was opposed to a military regime in hope thereby to vet his support, since Diya knew the two traditional rulers rarely agreed on any one issue. He also added that he had discussed with Jakande who was prepared to abandon Abiola if he was offered the position of Minister of External Affairs or Finance. Diya maintained that most Yoruba leaders would settle on any other Yoruba man, apart from an Egba man, as a presidential candidate. He eventually assured us that after an extensive consultation with Gani, Beko, Falana, Onagoruwa, the CLO, CD the elders, the Obas, and the leaders of through they agreed to support a total military regime for no less than five years to put the economy right. He then arranged for Onagoruwa to go and thank all those involved as well as seek the support of other eminent Yorubas...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ...Newswatch: Did you have a programme for option three?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark: We had but they do not want to implement it because they are spending all their time and energy trying to find how they will remain in power for five years. Their whole effort is geared towards that direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government was to undertake some specific programmes. The priority programme was education. The federal government was to concentrate heavily on improving the universities and other tertiary institutions all over the country. The federal government was to takeover the payment of teachers' salaries form primary schools to universities. Voluntary organisations were to be allowed to run schools up to university level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second priority was road networks. The federal government was to dualise the roads form the north to the south through the west and from north to south through the east. It would also complete the dualisation of the west-eat southern roads through Patani to Port Harcourt and Calabar. The federal government was also to take immediate steps to signpost all federal roads. It is indeed amazing that we spent so much money to build dual carriage roads but we cannot signpost the roads. All federal government interstate roads were to be centre paved with reflectors. The idea was to concentrate on projects that have immediate had direct impact on the ordinary Nigerian. In any case there is a limit to what could be done in one year.  There was no point in biting more than we could chew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the swearing in ceremony of the administrators they were to be given specific tasks which were to cover the following areas: construction of roads within the states, erecting standard secondary schools buildings (not ramshackle structures), providing science equipment for al the science subjects and the provisions of potable drinking water to every community within the states. They were to concentrate on repairing all potholes, constructing covered drainage and walk paths an all roads in the state capitals. They were to ensure that the roads were usable all the year round not like Awolowo Road that is passable only; in the dry season and becomes a swimming pool with the first rain. It was to be compulsory for state governments to provide a twenty-four hour ambulance service in all the state capitals. The were also to fun to a limited extent general hospitals as efficiently as it was possible. They were to provide drugs for only common diseases such as malaria and snakebites etc. They were not to undertake the building of prestigious and white elephant project like stadia, government guest houses, or theatres of any kind. The essence of these was that government would make impact on the lives of the ordinary Nigerian on the streets. It was designed to bring government closer to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local governments were to concentrate on constructing proper buildings for primary schools and equip them with chairs, tables, blackboards, and chalk. They were to run rural health clinics, provide potable drinking water to every community in the LGA, and where possible construct rural roads.  Above all it was to educate the grassroots on their civic responsibilities so that they don't sell their votes when the politicians eventually come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian police, the judiciary and the military were to receive special attention. The police force was to be reorganised to be more efficient and responsive, to become friends instead to goes. Every policeman on patrol was to carry a walkie-talkie. We were also to increase police foot patrol, purchase as many motor cycles as we could to increase police area patrol in the major cities. We were to change their vehicles from Land Rovers particularly for those in urban areas to faster vehicles like the Peugeot cars. We believe that the police are very poorly paid at the moment and we were to increase their allowances and improve on their accommodation. Only the police and the ambulance were to be allowed to use sirens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We were also to improve the judiciary. We were to increase the salary of every supreme court judge from whatever it is presently to N500,0000 per annum. We were convinced that the number of supreme court judges was small enough for the government to accommodate that level of annual salary easily.  This was to stop the accusation rightly or wrongly of corruption in the judiciary. We were to graduate the salaries down with the least in the judiciary hierarchy receiving N350,000 per annum. We were also to provide all the courts and judges with state of the art court reporting equipment. We were also to improve the standards of the courts, upgrade the building s and facilities such as air conditioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like the police we were to do a total surgical operation on the military. At the moment for lack of words to adequately describe the situation in the military it is a &quot;group of disorganised cowboys.&quot; Our soldiers don't have boots. Where they have boots, they don't have socks.  Where they have socks they don't have a complete uniform. You could go on endlessly. They don't have the equipment and where they do have the equipment they don't function. You can go on endlessly. The military was to be our main focus. We were to ensure that they are properly accommodated and their welfare is given top priority. Their pay was to be reviewed upwards immediately. That our soldiers have not revolted like the Zaireans is a demonstration of their high discipline indeed they remain the most disciplined soldiers of the African soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also as a part of the programme the minister of education was to be tasked within the first one week to draw what would constitute our national values. These values were to be taught in primary and secondary schools as well as in higher institutions. Indeed it was to be a deliberate policy of indoctrination. We believe that education is a primary vehicle in democratisation, technological development, and fundamental human rights in the world today. We had to place a lot of emphasis on education to lay a solid foundation for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: Your plan did not seem to include on of the cardinal programmes of the Abacha administration, the constitutional conference. Did it ever feature in your discussion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark: There was no mention of a constitutional conference on l;y a national conference and even that was a controversial point. When Diya first introduced it, he said it was the only basis on which CD/CLO and the Yorubas would support the military government and that the very first announcement must emphatically state that there would be &quot;a national conference.&quot; We accepted it because on the face value of it, we didn't see nay problem with a national conference, but when we wanted further explanation, in fairness to him, he confessed that it was to be used as a smoke screen for the government to buy time for five years. He circulated a paper in which he said the national conference would take nine months to a year to set up, the committee would then be given one year to complete its task and the government would take six months to study their submissions and recommendations before producing a white paper. The government would take six months after accepting the white paper to register the political parties. The conference was to be teleguided to recommend that the elections be spread over two years. That would be a total of four years and nine months or five years but it would be approximated to six years. The hidden design is for the regime to end on a historic note on the 31st December, 1999. At every stage of the discussion he tried desperately to convince us to accept 31st December, 19999 as the handover date but we remained adamant that if we didn't take option one then one year was the maximum time acceptable for option three. We became more resistant when we discovered that all issues to be discussed by the national conference were either already covered in the Political Bureau report or were contained in the constitution, unless, of course, we were going to allow room for secession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, what has come out is a constitutional conference instead of a national conference. From the original national conference, it is now a constitutional conference. What is the constitutional conference going to address? Nothing. Diya wanted the conference to determine the duration of the stay of government. How can the conference that does not know what the government agenda is, decide how long the government should stay? It is ridiculous and unbelievable. It is a delay tactic and a ploy., And that is what Diya wanted it to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: If you objected to the conference, how did Diya have his way?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark: We did no object to the conference per se but we objected to the fact that the conference was to be used by some perpetualists as delay tactics. This is the reason why nobody appears to know what the conference is to over. It is an open ended conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diya had his way because we are note there now. That is the more reason why they wanted us out of the way. So that they could have their way and take the nation for a ride on a directionless roller coaster. Whether it is a national or constitutional conference it is not going to address any new issues. As long as the conference is on, Abacha and Diya will remain in power and that is what they wanted...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ...Newswatch: What is the way forward?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark: I have already sent a note to the Head of State on the way forward. You can get a copy from him. The summary is that he must find a way to have by 31 December 1994 to a nominated national government to speedily conduct an election or come out with his political programme immediately which must end within one calendar year. We cannot decree democracy overnight; we must allow it to grow as a part of our culture. In the course of growth we are bound to miss steps on the way. That should not become an excuse for any overtly ambitious military man to stop the process. We must be allowed to get up after every fall and try again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African Development Foundation (ADF) is a public enterprise set up in 1980 by the US Congress to support self-development initiatives by African populations. The major goal is to provide the resources needed by African grassroots populations to reach self-reliant development. ADF does not impose external development concepts on African communities. Instead, it encourages Africans to suggest innovative approaches to problem-solving, which will eventually lead to self-reliance and self-sufficiency in the local communities. Researchers are requested to explore problems directly related to grassroots development and to make concrete recommendations that can be of assistance to development project promoters in the community. ADF provides grants for research initiated and conducted by African academics, development specialists, students and community groups. Researchers are encouraged to be creative in selecting their theme and to focus their research on issues which are crucial to the development of their countries. In 1994, ADF will allocate approximately US $675,000 to research project funding. Four types of fellowships will be awarded: Gray postgraduate fellowships (deadline August 1, 1994); Be applied research fellowships (deadline August 1, 1994); Grants for transfer of knowledge (no deadline); Leland development fellowships (deadline January 1, 1995).

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe's Ministry of Education has just launched what is believed to be the most comprehensive Aids education programme in Africa. Its aim is to inform young people of the dangers of Aids before they become sexually active, as HIV is spreading rapidly among Zimbabwean teenagers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between 600,000 and 1.5 million people in Zimbabwe are believed to be infected with HIV. In March, the National Public Health Laboratory reported that over 400 teenagers had been diagnosed with Aids, 90 percent of them girls.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first step in the new schools programme was the publication of a book, 'Let's Talk', aimed at 11-12 year olds in their final year of primary school. Books for older schoolchildren are planned from 1994. Unicef and other donors provided funding for educational materials. At the book's launch, education secretary Isiah Sibanda said the aim of the new course was to help teenagers &quot;resist exploitative sexual relationships.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health Minister Dr. Timothy Staps told provincial head teachers that the blame for the prevalence of HIV among schoolgirls lay with &quot;sugar daddies&quot; -- older men who seduce young girls. Describing them as &quot;lethal weapons,&quot; he accused them of taking advantage of the accelerating economic crisis by offering to pay school fees in return for sexual favours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Let's Talk' does not refer directly to sugar daddies, but covers the theme in a chapter about &quot;Tanya,&quot; a nine-year-old schoolgirl. Coming home from school, she meets one of her uncles at the bore hole, but runs away when he attempts to molest her. Children are encouraged to discuss how they would have reacted in a similar situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book tackles Aids through direct and indirect messages and also touches on other issues of importance to young people -- including smoking, alcohol, and bullying. Poems and songs are used to get the message across.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Helen Jackson, author of the prevention manual 'Aids: Action Now,' things the government is right to prioritise Aids education. She approves of the book's approach to condoms, which are mentioned but not stressed since the target audience is children. &quot;I don't want anything that encourages early sexual experiment,&quot; she says. Condom use is dealt with more explicitly in Jackson's book which is aimed at adults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Condoms have proved to be a difficult area for Zimbabwe's Aids educators. After adverse comment from Vice-President Joshua Nkomo, a television condom commercial was dropped recently. Church circles oppose any mention of condoms -- but since many schools are church-funded, their support is essential fro any successful education campaign. Sibanda expressed a government hope that churches and educators would &quot;work together.&quot; And the country's Scripture Union has for some time been running its own schools Aids programme using visiting teams of young people -- an approach which allows for much greater frankness than is normal in the classroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another problem is the strong cultural aversion to talking about sex.  Traditionally, instruction in Zimbabwe was given to girls buy their aunts, and in some remote areas girls were subjected to virginity tests. The tests were still being conducted as recently as 1976 at one mission in Mutoko, where a quarter of all girls said their aunts had tested them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jackson wonders whether school teachers can cope with the huge task of adjusting to the post-Aids era. &quot;There is a need to demystify a great many sexual issues,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An earlier attempt at a schools Aids books in Zimbabwe stressed the possibility that Aids could be spread by sharing a -- giving the false impression of a highly infectious illness and possibly contributing towards people with Aids. This time the emphasis is on sexual transmission and convincing teachers that the virus is not spread by, for example, mosquitoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To back up the book, a series of workshops is being organised throughout Zimbabwe. Three-day courses are being run for the 150,000 teachers involved in the first phase of the programme.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US-based company Population Services International is attempting to Influence sexual behaviour through innovative social marketing programmes designed to make condom use attractive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PSI launched its first programme in Zaire in 1988, at a time when many countries were reluctant to acknowledge the existence of the Aids pandemic.  Before the programme began, 300,000 condoms were being sold annually in the country. By 1991, PSI had sold 18.3 million of its Prudence condoms, at an affordable price to citizens.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the only international non-governmental organisation marketing condoms for Aids prevention, PSI works through the private sector, relying on donors to help fund marketing programmes which deliver essential health products to low-income families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice-president Judith Timyan says PSI always sells condoms, rather than giving them away. &quot;Giving them away creates a stigma,&quot; says Timyan. &quot;It tells people to use them because they have no choice. The brilliance of our marketing effort lies in treating people as consumers rather than beneficiaries. You give them choices, take away the stigma and make it a cool product.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PSI's programme in Zambia was launched a year ago on World Aids Day.  Since that time, sales of &quot;Maximum&quot; condoms have exceeded 4.4 million -- the highest per capita sales in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PSI has been helped in its efforts by community groups in Zambia who have rallied behind Aids prevention programmes at a time when some feel the government has been slow to act. The involvement of churches has also been significant. The church-supported Kara Counselling Programme on Aids in Zambia is recognised as the most successful in the region. Now money has been set aside for a mass media condom marketing campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By contrast in Botswana, where PSI launched the &quot;Lovers' Plus&quot; brand in June 1993, government involvement has been substantial. But PSI Botswana director Renee Romanowski said some of the government efforts trod a find line between persuasion and dictation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;By putting up billboards saying: Aids is your problem too -- use a condom, they are presenting a rather dour message. PSI brands the product and creates an attractive image for it so that people will actually choose to use a Lovers' Plus condom,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have a limited budget in Botswana, but we are aiming to make good use of the mass media. We conduct condom training sessions at events around the country to teach the correct way to use a condom. In our first three months of operation, we've reached out to a whole range of sales outlets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botswana and Zambia share an open approach to the discussion of Aids/HIV in public fora. But a lack of openness about the problem, coupled with the reluctance of foreign donors to provide funds before constitutional change, have been major obstacles for PSI in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the pandemics not as advanced in South Africa as further north, the incidence of HIV is doubling rapidly. By the year 2000,m it is estimated that 20-30 percent of the population will be HIV positive. PSI director in Durban, Mitchell Warren said people in South Africa had not recognised Aids as a problem yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In Zambia, almost everyone has buried a friend or family member who has died of Aids. The disease hasn't had that impact here yet,&quot; says Warren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Racially-divided communities labelled Aids as a &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; disease and therefore not their problem. Advocacy of condom use was linked in the minds of the black community to long-standing attempts by the apartheid regime to control black population growth. And in a highly repressive society, attempts to regulate sexual behaviour were seen as an encroachment on one small remaining area of personal autonomy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Warren believes the perception of condoms is now changing fairly rapidly. Despite an awareness that any new South African government will face a massive agenda of problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Warren is cautiously optimistic. PSI South Africa has recently secured funding from the Anglo-American Corporation, and pledges of support from two other corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are selling a fair number of condoms, but not as many as in Botswana and Zambia. The sad fact is that it won't be until we have seen more Aids deaths that behaviour will begin to change significantly. Getting the message into the townships is also difficult, when people there are facing a daily battle just to get basic foods.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botswana has launched a campaign to change national attitudes towards people with Aids. The &quot;A friend with Aids is still my friend&quot; theme will run in tandem with the World Health Organisation's 1993 slogan &quot;Time to act&quot; as part of the Botswana Aids/STD Unit's aim to address the discrimination faced in the country by people with HIV/Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Up to an estimated 92,000 people in the country (around 7 percent of the total population) may be HIV-positive, but awareness of the pandemic has lagged behind that of other African countries and the majority are unaware that they are affected. And the majority of those who do know won't tell friends or family for fear of discrimination at home or at work.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Aids Control Programme (NACP) head Dr. Matshidiso Moeti says these fears are justified -- people have lost jobs, friends and families as a result of disclosing that they are HIV-positive. &quot;Such reactions, and the stress they cause, can actually make a person with HIV more ill, and could possibly hasten death,&quot; said Moeti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;By preventing people from coming out, the best Aids educators -- those who have the virus -- are prevented from getting involved in the campaign against the disease. Botswana is one of the few countries in the region to have no person with HIV/Aids publicly involved in Aids prevention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because the general perception of people with Aids is negative at all levels of Botswana society, there is a fear of testing, and misconceptions about how the virus is contracted and the ability of HIV-positive people to continue working are widespread. A 1993 study suggests that although 90 percent of the population have some knowledge about the disease, the attitude towards people with Aids is predominantly ambivalent or negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Botswana, infection is concentrated in the 20 - 40 age group, with a much more even spread between urban and rural areas than in Central Africa, where the problem is predominantly urban. 34 percent of HIV-positive people are in the northern town of Francistown. According to Dr. Karl-Olaf Wathne, a WHO epidemiologist, the weekend movement from towns to rural areas and vice-versa is responsible for this spread pattern. But Wathne is optimistic about one thing: &quot;The attitude towards condoms is much more positive than two years ago, and the change has happened so quickly. The Botswana central medical stores distributes six times as many condoms per month as two years ago...around one million a month compared to two million a year. This is a positive sign that people are changing their sexual behaviour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since June, Botswana has been implementing the social marketing of the &quot;Lovers Plus&quot; brand of condoms, under the auspices of Population Services International (PSI) funded by USAID. PSI country director Renee Romanowski describes social marketing as selling the condoms at normal retail outlets at a subsidised and hence affordable price -- in Botswana 50 thebe for a packet of three. &quot;But wholesalers and retailers will still make a profit and therefore be motivated to distribute the product widely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botswana has identified three Ministries (education, labour and home affairs and local government, lands and housing) as key sectors in planning to respond to the epidemic, and is also involving non-governmental organisations in the campaign. President Ketumile Masire told a September (1993) briefing: &quot;The only weapons available to fight this deadly disease are education and behavioural change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country's Ministry of Health has drafted a national policy to ensure that HIV-positive people who come out do not suffer such negative consequences as being dismissed from work or expelled from school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposed legislation will prevent employers from sacking HIV-positive workers simply on the grounds that they have the virus. Doctors cannot reveal that their patients have Aids -- although people in the more advanced stages of the disease and suffering from an Aids-related complex of illnesses (ARC) still risk dismissal on medical grounds through repeated absenteeism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are groups of people with HIV who are considering coming out ,&quot; says Moeti, &quot;and we hope this campaign to change public attitudes will help them to come forward. It will help communities appreciate the problem and show that people with HIV are ordinary people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFRICA SOUTH &amp; EAST, January 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All over the world, Aids educators are trying to convince people that they should think before they act. Sexual behaviour -- the use of condoms, varieties of sexual activity, celibacy, fidelity -- has become the focus of attention, and depending on the cultural traditions, lifestyle, religion and age of their constituents, educators have chosen three major messages: stick to one partner, have safer sex (use condoms, non-penetrative sex) or abstinence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But despite increasing levels of information about HIV/Aids, behaviour change is happening more slowly. Researchers are beginning to isolate the reasons for this.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Male dominance. In most societies, it is difficult, if not impossible for a woman to refuse her partner sex. And men are often reluctant to use condoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Poverty. Many women in the developing world are forced into prostitution simply to support themselves and their families. &quot;You tell me I might die of Aids in some years. But if I do not work on the streets, my children will stave this week,&quot; one Zimbabwean sex worker told a newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Fatalism. People with strong traditional beliefs (or those who have bought the negative message of some early Aids propaganda) believe there is little that can be done to avert death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Availability of condoms. In some countries, condoms are hard to obtain, or expensive. There may be misconceptions about their effectiveness or a reluctance to use them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Lack of information on Aids/HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As it becomes increasingly clear that women are more and more the main victims of Aids, research is focusing on the empowerment of women within relationships as a vital factor in stemming the spread of the disease.  Medical workers are also trying to develop a non-contraceptive virucide for HIV, which women could use without having to seek male permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Burundi, the HIV-infection rate is about 15 percent in urban and peri-urban areas, and at least 1 percent in the rural areas where the bulk of the population lives. Research in 1987, 1990 and 1992 suggests that there have been behaviour changes. While most respondents said they were choosing fidelity, condom use has risen from 27.5 percent in Bujumbura in 1990 t almost 50 percent in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Uganda, where infection rates range between 5-29 percent, a 1992 survey of 4,500 young people between 15 and 24 suggested that there was good knowledge of the basic information about HIV. However, knowledge was not yet affecting actions. Although most respondents knew condoms prevented sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) including Aids, most also had a negative attitude towards condoms. 21 percent of mend and 8 percent of women reported having had an STD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Malawi, Dr. George Liomba, Head of the Malawi Aids Control programme estimated and adult HIV infection rate of at least 10 percent, probably much higher in the urban areas. A survey done in rural Thyolo district by Deborah Helitzer-Allen and Mercy Makhembera revealed that young women know Aids ca kill, but most think it will not kill them. They have heard -- through radio, church, or word of mouth -- that Aids is only spread by &quot;easy&quot; partners such as bar girls and truck drivers and that people with Aids are easily identified because they look ill. They did not identify their own partners as &quot;easy.&quot; The young women have a hard time changing their own behaviour. More than half of those interviewed said they were &quot;often&quot; forced to have sex; 66 percent had accepted money or gifts for sex. And in Thyolo, condoms are distributed through the district hospital, a round trip of 25 miles for many or sold in very limited numbers through a few commercial outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Tanzania, 40 women were interviewed about negotiating sex with their partners as the first phase of a WID/Aids in the Workplace project.  Almost all of them claimed to be ore careful about sex because of Aids. Half of them had used a condom for some sexual encounters, but only 24 percent used condoms regularly. Although 72 percent of the women said they could say &quot;No&quot; to a partner wanting sex, only 39 percent had ever refused to have sex if a partner would not use a condom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Ethiopia, surveys are now revealing alarmingly high HIV-infection rates, 17-18 percent among pregnant women in some areas and up to 75 percent among sex workers in the capital. Ethiopia's Organisation for Social Services for Aids (OSSA) believes earlier under-reporting related to the country's extreme poverty. &quot;If people who are malnourished become infected with this virus, they will not live long enough to develop Aids. They will die earlier, their lowered resistance falling prey to opportunistic diseases...This makes our statistics misleading,&quot; says OSSA's Abba Tsegaye Kenneni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aids education targeted at sex workers has become a priority. &quot;Our work is starting to have an effect,&quot; says Negussie Yitbareq, Head of Aids Information in the Ministry of Health. &quot;The number of clients for bar-ladies is decreasing and women are refusing to work in bars to the extent that some bars report they cannot get enough staff.&quot; Hotels in Addis are also starting to provide condoms in their rooms and souvenir shops. Ana Aids information hotline, training for counsellors and teachers and home-based care for people with Aids are also planned, as well as Aids education for the country's large refugee population. But poverty, overstretched health services and inadequate condom supply pose huge problems for Aids educators.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAILY OBSERVER, April 4, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Representatives of various government agencies and non-governmental organisations met at State House last week under the chairmanship of Ajaratou Lady Njaimeh Jawara, to discuss the setting of a National Society for the Development of Women and Children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Society would be The Gambia branch of the proposed African First Ladies Association for Women and Child Development.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposal for the First Ladies Association came from Mrs. Suzanne Mubarak (wife of the Egyptian president) who, during last year's OAU Summit in Cairo, hosted a seminar on the status of women and children in Africa, attended by Lady Njaimeh and several other First Ladies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening the meeting at State House, Lady Njaimeh said the Association of First Ladies would be a non-governmental organisation affiliated to the OAU and working as a pressure group on matters dealing with women and children. She said it would be totally non-political and called all patriotic Gambians to give it their full support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lady Njaimeh has chosen a committee of 11 people to serve as the executive of the Gambia branch. She briefed the meeting on the decisions of the Cairo Seminar of First Ladies last June, and on a letter from Mrs.  Mubarak making a number of suggestions regarding the proposed association.  One of these is a proposal to set up through voluntary contributions, a special fund to help upgrade the Women's Unit at the OAU Secretariat in to a division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lady Njaimeh is to hold further consultations before the next OAU Summit when the First Ladies are due to meet again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFRICA NEWS SERVICE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Port Harcourt, Nigeria -- American relations with Africa's most populous nation reached a new low last month with a State Department decision classifying Nigeria as one of the world's four top drug trafficking countries. Nigerian couriers import 35 to 40 percent of all the heroine coming into the United States, U.S. officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision adds new sanctions to a succession of economic and political penalties imposed on Nigeria by the Clinton administration, in response to a stalled democratization process and lax airport security. This latest action puts Nigeria, a loyal Cold War ally, roughly on a par under U.S. law with pariah states like Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The continuing conundrum Nigeria poses for U.S. policy is apparent in this coastal city, lit by the hissing flares of dozens of oil rigs. Petroleum from the surrounding Niger River delta and the deep-water wells offshore is shipped directly across the Atlantic, where it provides the bulk of the unleaded gasoline and much of the diesel and aviation fuel used on the east coast of the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent years, Nigeria's rank on the list of U.S. oil suppliers has fluctuated between second, after Saudi Arabia, and fifth. And because Nigeria produces light, low-sulfur crude, which burns cleaner and is cheaper to refine than most Middle East oil, Nigeria's output is prized for its quality as well as its quantity, government and industry experts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Modern refineries in Philadelphia and New Jersey, owned by the two largest American producers in Nigeria, Chevron and Mobil, are specially engineered to take advantage of the environmental and economic superiority of West African crude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The designation of Nigeria as an international drug trafficker prompted heated debate, according to administration officials involved in the discussions. Opponents argued that it was neither credible nor prudent to group Nigeria with Iran, Myanmar (Burma) and Syria, the three nations already on the State Department's list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The inclusion of Nigeria automatically halts all non-humanitarian economic assistance to the west African country and requires an American vote against loans to Nigeria at the World Bank and other multilateral financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Actions against Nigeria began last June, after the country's military leaders annulled a presidential election that was to return the country to civilian rule. The Clinton administration ended contacts with the military, expelled Nigerian officers from U.S. military training institutions, prohibited visits to the United States by senior Nigerian officials and their families, and suspended several aid projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In August, the U.S. Department of Transportation barred direct air service to and from Lagos, Nigeria's principal city, after ruling that inadequate airport security procedures &quot;threaten the safety of passengers, aircraft and crews.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest moves against Nigeria mark the first time that a country friendly to the United States has been penalized economically for failure to cooperate in anti-drug efforts. In the past, such nations routinely received presidential waivers, a kind of warning slap on the wrist, as was done this year for Afghanistan, Bolivia, Laos, Lebanon, Panama and Peru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nigeria is a poor African country that nobody likes, which is the only reason it appears on this list and the big Latin American drug-dealing nations do not,&quot; one official who participated in the decision said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Nigeria is neither a drug producer nor a significant consumer, this year's annual State Department survey of international drug activity says Lagos-based networks &quot;move large quantities of heroine from Asia,&quot; manage &quot;sophisticated money laundering&quot; schemes, and traffic in cocaine, primarily from Brazil to Europe. &quot;Official corruption remains a serious obstacle to effective counternarcotics efforts,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While drug policy is the latest arena for conflict, the overall deterioration in bilateral relations is a direct result of political deadlock in Nigeria. The current government, headed by General Sani Abacha, which came to power last November, replacing an interim civilian administration set up to run the country in the aftermath of the June election cancellation, has promised a return to democratic rule but has proposed no timetable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The continuing political confusion has precluded the bold measures that would be needed to rejuvenate Nigeria's battered economy. Plummeting world oil prices reduced government revenues by 60% in the early 1980s and have remained depressed. Heavy borrowing to avert economic collapse has saddled the country with a foreign debt now exceeding $30 billion, roughly equivalent to the gross domestic product. And widespread corruption has made many Nigerians cynical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among both prominent Nigerians and gross roots activists, there is apparent consensus that the country's social and economic ills can be addressed only by a democratic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bashoran M.K.O. Abiola, the multimillionaire businessman who was the acknowledged victor in the June 12 election, said tackling the economy would have been his first priority. &quot;The economic crisis is turning us into a nation of drug peddlers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former head-of-state General Olusegan Obasanjo, the only Nigerian military leader to cede power to an elected government, argues that the days of any regime that tries to rule without a popular mandate are numbered. &quot;The people of Nigeria can put an end to military rule,&quot; he said. &quot;We can force them out if we decide to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One small group living in and around this city built on oil has gone to the barricades already. The Ogoni people, who number about 500,000, out of a population of some 100 million, have used a combination of public protest and civil disobedience to block operations by Shell, the country's largest petroleum producer. Other ethnic groups in the oil-producing region are threatening similar action against oil operations in their areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The oil is stolen property,&quot; said Ken Sara-Wiwa, a well-known novelist and leader of the resistance campaign, during a tour of several Ogoni villages to point out spillage and contamination still evident from drilling as early as three decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While crude oil worth $30 billion has been taken from Ogoni soil, he said, local people have been left with substandard houses, inadequate schools and health facilities, and poisoned land. &quot;People in the United States who use so much of our oil,&quot; he said, &quot;should know we are determined to stop it.&quot; The message the Ogoni are sending, he said, is that if democratic change in Nigeria is stymied, Nigerians won't pay the price alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Claude Ake, a leading Nigerian intellectual and head of a think-tank at the University of Port Harcourt, said he remains optimistic that Nigeria's social and economic woes will sort themselves out, &quot;once the political incoherence is dealt with.&quot; He criticized Western aid programs for putting economic priorities ahead of concerns about accountable government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What we don't need is new initiatives to restart economic growth,&quot; he said. &quot;What we need is genuine support for democracy. That will allow not only peace and stability but also development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SIDEBAR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos -- Nigerians first noticed Funmilayo Oni-Okpaku in February when the 53-year old justice marched into the headquarters of the national drug enforcement agency to supervise the burning of a huge pile of confiscated heroine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although her appointment last year to head a tribunal investigating drug offenses drew little attention in a country with considerable skepticism about government promises to crack down on wrong-doers, she has recently captured headlines as a tough, front-line warrior in the drug battles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When she was asked last year to make the temporary move from Benin City, where she is a high court judge, to Lagos, friends advised her against it and her husband and four children expressed apprehension. While admitting to a belief that her new post is a dangerous one, she said she had no choice but to accept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;How could I say no?&quot; she asked during an interview in her office, housed in a bedraggled concrete structure. Nigerians are &quot;appalled&quot; that &quot;drug trafficking has reared its head,&quot; she said, and are embarrassed that Nigeria has been labeled as a major player in the international narcotics trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm not a crusader,&quot; she said. &quot;I just believe people should do things correctly so we can have a decent society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The creation of special tribunals to try drug offenders is a government response to growing criticism at home and abroad. Oni-Okpaku concedes that her campaign has been slow to gather momentum. Most of the successful prosecutions so far have involved &quot;little minions,&quot; not the people planning the operations and making the huge profits, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian drug networks reportedly use hired couriers, who travel on commercial airliners to Europe and the United States after swallowing condoms filled with up to 400 grams of heroine, kept down with the help of anti-nausea medications and the thick stews that are traditional West African fare. Commissions are said to range from $1000 to $2000 for each gram successfully delivered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian government's largely ineffective enforcement efforts &quot;have focused almost exclusively on low-level drug couriers,&quot; a new State Department report on international narcotics control said. But the military regime that took power in November seized nearly 600 pounds of heroine arriving in Lagos from Thailand in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joe Brown Akubueze, who has been charged in connection with the huge shipment, is on trial in Oni-Okpaku's courtroom, the first &quot;baron&quot; to come before her, she said. The size of the shipment, concealed in water coolers and destined for redistribution via the courier network, is an indication that traffickers are getting bolder, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judge ordered the heroine destroyed after discovering during an inspection visit that eight packets had been stolen while locked in a storage room. When she returned two days later for the incineration and found four more bundles gone, she ordered seven top drug agency officials arrested on the spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the officials were later released, several lost their jobs this month in a house-cleaning by the military-led government, which has pledged to intensify its antidrug campaign.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African Development Foundation (ADF) is a public enterprise set up in 1980 by the US Congress to support self-development initiatives by African populations. The major goal is to provide the resources needed by African grassroots populations to reach self-reliant development. ADF does not impose external development concepts on African communities. Instead, it encourages Africans to suggest innovative approaches to problem-solving, which will eventually lead to self-reliance and self-sufficiency in the local communities. Researchers are requested to explore problems directly related to grassroots development and to make concrete recommendations that can be of assistance to development project promoters in the community. ADF provides grants for research initiated and conducted by African academics, development specialists, students and community groups. Researchers are encouraged to be creative in selecting their theme and to focus their research on issues which are crucial to the development of their countries. In 1994, ADF will allocate approximately US $675,000 to research project funding. Four types of fellowships will be awarded: Gray postgraduate fellowships (deadline August 1, 1994); Be applied research fellowships (deadline August 1, 1994); Grants for transfer of knowledge (no deadline); Leland development fellowships (deadline January 1, 1995).

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, April 15 - 19, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was an unusual week for Kampala. The city buzzed with talk of overthrowing the imperialist order policed by the United States of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After a slumber of twenty years the Pan African movement was flexing its muscles, to do battle for its own place in the sun. The Pan African Congress last met in Dar es Salaam in 1974. Then the world was being ruled from Moscow and Washington.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now only the voice of America matters. Metaphorically, the just-ended 8th Pan African Congress is the puny David swinging the sling against Goliath. But whether it fells the giant o not, the congress was an event worth remembering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OF SURPRISES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First the surprise. Kabaka Ronald Mutebi hosted the delegates to the congress a sumptuous cocktail party on Wednesday. As they toured the Bulange, many of those from the diaspora were moved to the point of tears to discover an ancient dynasty still ruling in the heart of Africa. &quot;Ebyaffe&quot; serves a progressive Pan African purpose, after all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Mohammad Farah Aideed stole the limelight from day one, Monday April 4. These days even Museveni does not get a two-minute's standing ovation on merely showing his face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As you may know, I and my people are engaged in a struggle against a new imperialism,&quot; Aideed begun his diatribe against the Yankees. And the crowd loved it all. Seeing the frail middle-aged man in the flesh, it was hard to believe he was the &quot;demon&quot; on whose head the Americans had put a price in their hour of despair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aideed made big waves when he called for a Pan African parliament in the next five years and demanded for compensation from the Americans for destroying over $1 bn of Somali property, 18,000 lives and 45,000 limbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Col. Dr. John Garang and Dr. Riak Machar, the commanders of the two feuding SPLA factions, the congress meant a lot. The &quot;Arabs&quot; in northern Sudan knew this and they fielded over forty pro-Khartoum delegations to &quot;outgun&quot; the southern Sudanese bushmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For both parties, it was a bitter war of words. Eritrean foreign minister Gebre Yemane poked the first stick in the Sudanese beehive. On Monday he read his president's analysis of the Sudanese civil strife and laid the blame squarely on the shoulders of the militant muslims of Northern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Up to the very last, the Sudanese question threatened to rend the congress apart. Everytime a pro-Bashir delegate opened his mouth to speak, SPLA Young Turks unfurled banners condemning the Khartoum government. The hostilities often broke into shouting matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thursday, the northern most; the secession of Southern Sudan, their footstool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For once, Garang and Machar sat side by side, and joined forces against their common enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Happy Otafiire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One man who must have regretted ever inviting the querulous Sudanese was Col. Kahinda Otafiire, the convener and chairman of the international preparatory committee of the 7th PAC. He had a tough time keeping the Sudanese from flying at each others' throats. And satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Friday, a smile almost split the colonel's face in two when the Sudanese warriors embraced and shook hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, the IGGAD initiative has yet to hammer back into place the weakest link in the chain of the Pan Africanist ideal. The relationship between Arab and Black Africa. Another trying moment came on the issue of reparations for slavery. Dr. Chinweizu who represented the Lagos branch of the International Committee on Reparations stabbed a finger at Arab slavery which is still going on in Sudan and Mauritania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So by implication, Arabs had to also pay for enslaving Africans. That sent a northern Sudanese mad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You are even whiter than myself and you have the nerve to call us Arabs!&quot; the indignant man with a heavy Arab accent told off Chinweizu who was actually lighter. The Libyan foreign affairs minister Abdul Moussa turned read when the issue came again in a plenary session. Which told volumes about this Pan Africanism &quot;katogo&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof. Ali Mazrui saved the congress from a split on this question, when he suggested that Arab slavery was a household affair. For the time being Arab and black Africans had to stick together to take on imperialism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the congress was wrapping things up, a bomb shell came from an unexpected quarter -- Ghana. Taata Ofosu of the Democratic Alliance of Ghana (DAG) put forward a resolution condemning Jerry Rawlings' government for humiliating and harassing the late Kwame Nkrumah's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DEVIL'S ADVOCATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Esiu Sutherland, an eloquent spokeswoman of the Ghanaian official delegation acted the consummate devil's advocate. She denied that the Ghana government had impounded the passport of Madame Fatiah, Nkrumah's widow, or confiscated her house. Till Gorkah Nkrumah, the son of the late Ghanaian president, spoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This government (Rawlings') has been the only government since the coup (which overthrew Nkrumah) that has withdrawn the passport of my mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You cannot claim that you are rehabilitating the image of Nkrumah while at the same time withdrawing the passport of his widow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You could have heard a pin drop. Then the outrage. The three Ghanaian government representatives sat dumbstruck as their regime was &quot;whipped&quot; for cruelty to the family of a pan Africanist. Gender sensitive speakers also gave a bashing to the trio for defending the wrong done to an African widow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Col. Otafiire had to step in to patch up things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wearing an embarrassed expression on his face, the ESO chief said that he was at a loss because the controversy had exploded when the Ugandan government was already &quot;whispering&quot; to the Ghanaian government. Though at the end, it was Gamal Nkrumah who saved the face of the Ghana government by pleading to the garrulous Ofosu to withdraw his resolution. As a compromise, the congress delegated Kwesi Pratt and Mohamed bin Abdallah, also Ghanaians, to ensure that Fatiah and her family got better treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNCLE SAM WORRIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American State Department officials, must have sensed that their government was going to come under heavily under fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> George Moose, the US Assistant Secretary of State for Africa is quoted by local media sources to have admitted that his presence in Kampala at the time of the congress was not a coincidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There should be many more Pan African congresses, outside Uganda. That seemed to be the prayer on the lips of Ken Lukyamuzi, the vocal multi-partyist who was viciously attacked by Maj. Ondoga ori Amaza for criticizing the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a congress of African opposition groups. They found a safe platform for damning their own governments. It was better than the OAU where only diplomatic niceties are exchanged between ruling parties and military juntas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ngugi wa 0Thiongo, the celebrated Kenyan author spat at Moi's regime on behalf of the clandestine &quot;Mwakenya.&quot; Malawian and Ghanaian dissidents also took the chance to rubbish their home governments. Be sure the next congress will attract all the briefcase opposition to Museveni if convened outside Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 7th PAC was a rebirth of third world radicalism. The buzzwords were liberation, revolution, workers' rights, south-south networking, a new economic and communications order, and the overthrow of despots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Yoweri Museveni's two speeches to the congress were a syncretic mix or revolutionary rhetoric and World Bank/IMF adjustment economics. The president rode his old hobby horse -- Africa's need for homegrown democracy, and his views on science and technology. No new thought has re-emerged on post-cold economics and politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over a hundred resolutions were passed. But the congress needs more than tough talk to see it through resolutions such as the demand on the US to life the Cuban and Libyan blockades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A tall order. But great revolutions begin as the dreams of a few mad men, don't they?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE GHANAIAN CHRONICLE, April 11-13, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already high temperatures at the just-ended 7th Pan-Africanist Congress in Kampala threatened to erupt after a group of Ghanaian delegates and participants at the Congress circulated a petition on the PNDC treatment of Madame Fathia Nkrumah, wife of Ghana's first president, Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spearheaded by Kwesi Pratt, Jnr., leader of the non-governmental delegation to the 7th PAC and chairman of Nkrumahist party, PPDD, in conjunction with several Ghanaian exiles attending the conference, the petition asked that the passport of Madame Fathia Nkrumah be restored to her; that the Nkrumah family house at Labone, currently occupied by the Speaker of Parliament, Justice D. F. Annan be given back to Madame Nkrumah and her offsprings; and that the Kotoka International Airport be renamed after Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The withdrawal of Madame Fathia's passport and residence by the PNDC government, which claims to be strongly Pan-Africanist and which erected a multi-million-cedi mausoleum in honour of the Great Osagyefo in 1989, according to the petition, has resulted in Madam Fathia living in &quot;a one room bed-sit in Cairo, Egypt.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hundreds of Pan-Africanists attending the Congress, which owed much of its early beginnings to the likes of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, were outraged when the petition hit the floor. A lady delegate from Nigeria, Ms. Abiola, immediately took to the podium after reading the petition and demanded that the petition be addressed as part of the larger issue of the oppression of women and widows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the fact that the petition was signed by more than 400 people attending the Congress, (P)NDC government loyalists still attempted to defend the shabby treatment of the Nkrumah family. Mrs. Esi Sutherland Addy, a former Deputy Minister for Education under the PNDC regime, asked delegates and participants to appraise themselves of the true facts of the case before jumping to conclusions. Briefly, the situation threatened to get out of hand when Taafa Ofosu, a victim of the PNDC government who now lives in exile in London, shot up to reiterate the position of the petition and called Mrs.  Sutherland Addy a liar. Mrs. Sutherland-Addy who together with ex-Culture Minister Dr. Mohammed Ben Abdallah, were part of a three-member government delegation to the Congress, is fairly respected by many Pan-Africanist women partly because she has the reputation of being an advocate for women's issues and because she happens to be the daughter of a respected veteran Pan-Africanist Bill Sutherland. Mr. Bill Sutherland also attended the Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a related development, seven Ghanaian participants to the Congress, including Zaya Yebo, ex-Minister of Youth and Sports under the PNDC government who now lives in exile in the Gambia; Kwesi Pratt, Jnr.: Akyaaba Addai-Sebo, who was shot by government functionaries and spirited outside the country in the early days of the revolution, circulated a statement condemning the Rawlings regime on several issues, including extra-judicious killings and the negative impact of structural adjustment on Ghanaians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Structural Adjustment was a big issue at the Congress with delegates and participants condemning IMF/World Bank stipulations in very strong terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Congress was hosted by President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and attended by Pan-Africanists and freedom fighters from across the Continent and in the diaspora. Notable among attendees were Somali faction leader General Mohammed Farah Aideed who was given a standing ovation when he addressed the Congress; Colonel John Garang of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA); Kwame Ture, formerly called Stockley Carmichael of the Black Panthers; Mrs. Betty Shabazz, widow of Malcolm X; Mrs. Graca Machel, widow of Mozambique's first President Samora Machel; author Ngugi Wa Thiongo and Ali Mazrui.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such interesting characters as President Jerry John Rawlings, Winnie Mandela, Col. Muammar Gaddafi, Nigeria's Alhaji Mashood Abiola, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, who would have undoubtedly added more fireworks to the already volatile Congress, were expected to attend but did not show up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, May 13, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's national working committee, the Nats and Inkatha, all put pressure on Nelson Mandela in his choice of cabinet. Farouk Chothia, Stephen Laufer, Chris Louw, Paul Stober report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNMISTAKEABLY bearing Nelson Mandela's personal stamp, the national unity cabinet announced this week emerged after days of juggling during which the president was forced to keep his eye on a number of balls tossed to him by the coalition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps most influential among the juggler's assistants was Mandela's own organisation, with the ANC's highest body, the national working committee, insisting on retaining control over several key portfolios despite massive pressure from the National Party and Inkatha for him to relinquish them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the cabinet positions the ANC was determined to hang on to were those related to security, including the defence, police, and justice ministries, and land, key to the party's reconstruction and development programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC members have also been named as deputies in key ministries the party relinquished to their coalition partners. Said one cabinet insider: &quot;We have a watchman in any ministry with relevance to the future.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Watchmen&quot; include trade union heavyweight Alec Erwin as deputy finance minister to the Nat's Derek Keys, ANC legal advisor Penuell Maduna as deputy to Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Valli Moosa at Provincial Affairs under Roelf Meyer, which will be key in the development of the federal system, and Thoko Msane at Agriculture, which is headed by the Nat's Kraai van Niekerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC can expect to instal a second level of &quot;watchmen&quot; when the directors general are appointed. These could include Cheryl Carolus at welfare, and John Samuel at education. Lawyer Nicholas &quot;Fink&quot; Haysom was reportedly offered the top South African Police position, but turned it down in favour of a counsellor's post in the President's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The appointments of Winnie Mandela and Bantu Holomisa as deputies in the education and environment ministries respectively relates directly to their standing in the ANC. Mandela appears to have found it impossible to ignore their popular followings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi's appointment to the Home Affairs ministry -- formerly Interior -- was criticised by Inkatha spokesman Ziba Jiyane as &quot;the only substantial ministry we got&quot;. He said Buthelezi &quot;was very hesitant right up to the last moment&quot;, but had told colleagues they could take cabinet positions if they wanted to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi had argued in Inkatha for an opposition role, saying the ANC would use the cabinet as a &quot;rubber stamp&quot; for its own policies, &quot;messing up the country&quot; and then holding everyone responsible. But the opposite view, that it was &quot;important to have a foothold in decision making on things that affect people on the ground&quot; prevailed, said Jiyane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the home affairs ministry is regarded as a very senior portfolio and Buthelezi's appointment is a clear sign that Mandela intends to continue with his policy of national reconciliation, ANC insiders insisted the Inkatha chief would not be allowed to run future elections. Although this function has traditionally resided within the interior ministry, several senior sources said a permanent independent electoral commission would be established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP argued strongly for the defence, correctional services, justice, and police portfolios, saying the appointment of one or more senior Nats who enjoyed the trust of the security forces would smooth the transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the ANC's top committee was unwilling to relinquish the ministries, arguing that the NP's human rights record made it impossible to give them the justice portfolio. Similarly, reservations surfaced on the Nats' willingness to root out the &quot;third force&quot; inside the security forces.  &quot;They want the security forces to know right away who is boss,&quot; said one Nat source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Added to the equation was the ANC's intention of leaving General Johan van der Merwe in charge of the police and General George Meiring at the head of the military for the time being. They are seen as powerful leadership figures, particularly for white members of the security forces who need to be led gently to integration and transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Balance required ANC people to head these ministries as long as the old guard stayed in uniform, argued the NWC. While Sydney Mufamadi's appointment to head the law and order ministry -- renamed &quot;safety and security&quot; -- was almost universally welcomed within the SAP and the ANC, former MK commander Joe Modise's nomination to the defence portfolio was more controversial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior SANDF officers made their preference for Modise clear, but ANC members have criticised his endorsement of the generals' demands for an end to defence cuts. He has also not fully lived down criticism of his failure to prevent human rights abuses in MK camps in Angola in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Modise enjoys the loyalty of the MK hierarchy, many of whom can expect to take senior uniformed and defence ministry positions in the near future. His conduct of the integration negotiations and TEC defence subcouncil have been positively received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The appointment of Inkatha's Joe Matthews as deputy minister of safety and security is both a concession to Buthelezi and a calculated strategy by Mandela, who is keen to show the kwaZulu police that their long-term interests are best served by integration into South Africa's future security establishment. A former ANC member, Matthews is seen as intelligent and flexible, and ANC security experts believe it will be possible to establish a good working relationship with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's insistence on retaining the main security portfolios -- correctional services ultimately went to Inkatha's Sipho Mzimela -- cost constitutional affairs expert Kader Asmal a key position as provincial affairs minister. The portfolio, vital to shaping the federal relationship between central and regional government, went to the NP's Roelf Meyer in return for Nat aquiescence on the security ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The land portfolio was almost lost to the ANC when the NP insisted on heading the agriculture ministry, which has traditionally included land matters. Mandela was reportedly preparing to withdraw his nomination of Derek Hanekom last Friday when the NWC stepped in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saying the ANC was the only party with a coherent policy on land, and pointing to its central importance for the party's reconstruction and development programme, several NWC members insisted on splitting land and agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hanekom's nomination to the portfolio was also contentious, with some arguing that a ministry responsible for the emotive issues of resettlement, land redistribution and compensation should go to a black. Former ANC Women's League general secretary Baleka Kgositsile was mentioned as a possible minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although regarded as a political heavyweight, Kgositsile was felt to lack experience in land issues. Hanekom, whose expertise and struggle credentials are unquestioned, was championed by several NWC members.  &quot;Competence won out over political correctness,&quot; said one participant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inkatha is understood to have had its eye on at least one senior security position as well as health and housing. The two departments are key to improving basic living conditions, and represent areas in which there is potentially much political hay to be made in the runup to the 1999 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recognising their importance, Mandela stuck to his original choices of Joe Slovo for housing and Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma for health.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, May 20, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FORMER state president FW de Klerk ceded control of a third of the land in kwaZulu/Natal to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini in a highly secretive deal the day before he was voted out of office last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The transfer of three million hectares scattered throughout the province was effected in terms of the kwaZulu Ingonyama Trust Act, passed by the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly and assented to by De Klerk on April 25 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In terms of the legislation, King Goodwill Zwelithini, the sole trustee, will administer all tribal land in the province -- with the cost of administration being borne by the new regional government. It covers all the land for which the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly was established in 1971 and land acquired by the kwaZulu government under various proclamations and laws since then.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It appears that under pressure from the kwaZulu government, De Klerk moved to prevent kwaZulu- administered tribal land from falling under state control -- the automatic effect of the new constitution, which kicked in on April 27 -- in an apparent sop to the Inkatha Freedom Party in exchange for its participation in the April poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A source close to Andre Fourie, the former minister of regional and land affairs, said the land transfer had been part of negotiations between the National Party government, the ANC and the IFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa, who played a key role in the negotiations leading to the IFP's participation in the elections, denied this: &quot;The Ingonyama Trust doesn't mean a thing to me; I'm hearing about it for the first time. I doubt very much that Nelson Mandela would have known about it.  You are drawing a blank from me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Nelson Mandela's office was yesterday unable to comment, as was the office of Zwelithini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC leaders in kwaZulu/Natal also appeared dumbfounded when approached this week. Regional supremo Jacob Zuma said he knew nothing of the transfer, and knew of no one else in the ANC who was aware of it. &quot;It is surprising that this happened just before the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in a furious reaction, ANC Midlands spokesman Blade Nzimane said: &quot;The fact that this was done behind the backs of people and through an illegitimate bantustan structure seems to indicate that was aimed at undermining any constitutional accommodation of the king by the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It seems to have been aimed at ensuring that kwaZulu retained actual control of the land even if it was disbanded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also unaware of the transfer was Roelf Meyer, the NP's central constitutional negotiator; Coenie de Villiers, director-general of land affairs -- who said &quot;nobody consulted me about this Act&quot; -- and the new Minister of Land Affairs, Derek Hanekom, who said he was &quot;shocked&quot; by the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Effectively the land that was kwaZulu is no longer state land,&quot; Hanekom said. &quot;It's in private ownership, held in trust by the king.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added: &quot;My ministry will be raising the issue politically and will be carrying out a full investigation to find out on whose ultimate authority the transfer was effected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have consistently tried to get a moratorium on the transfer and sale of state land, but we never thought bantustan land would be transferred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are potentially grave political implications and we're deeply concerned.&quot; He hinted that the National Assembly might overturn the legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some IFP sources described the formation of the Ingonyama Trust as a &quot;house-keeping arrangement&quot; between Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and De Klerk's governments before their demise -- and an attempt to protect the monarch from possible ANC rule in kwaZulu/Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The chances of the land ever being alienated (from the king) are now remote in the extreme,&quot; said an IFP source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zuma insisted the formation of the Ingonyama Trust was not part of the agreement that brought the IFP into elections. &quot;We made an elaborate proposal for the monarchy so far as kwaZulu/Natal is concerned which we still have to iron out in the provincial constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers believe the legislation has far-reaching implications: it means that future governments in the province will have to gain Zwelethini's permission -- or the permission of his chiefs or any other representative he charges with decision-making responsibility over the trust land -- before engaging in any development on the land in question. It means that land earmarked for redistribution in terms of the ANC's land reform plans is no longer available to the central state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barely 300 000ha of state land is now available for redistribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The formation of the trust also consolidates the relationship between Zwelethini and chiefs, as they will now be reliant on him for development in their areas -- and will reduce the prospect of an ANC-led government in kwaZulu/Natal winning major support among IFP-aligned traditional rulers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lawyers contacted yesterday stressed the land deal had not gone before the Transitional Executive Council which had overthrown other land decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also said that a challenge to the land transfer could be mounted.  In terms of court precedents, changes to the ownership status of state land could not be made without consultation with the affected parties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAILY OBSERVER, April 11, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa seems to be overpowered by the evil spirit of destruction and death. Throughout the continent, a never-ending spiral of destruction, and death by the tens of thousands, is taking place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tragic plane crash in Kigali, Rwanda, last week demonstrated that we have become so good at mass destruction and fratricide that we are now killing two presidents at a time. Nothing, absolutely nothing on the entire continent seems to be good enough to let be, to encourage, to help along, to improve upon. No. Nothing. Everything must be destroyed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Take the relations between the two sister republics of Senegal and The Gambia -- two countries comprising blood relatives on either side of the border, of the same languages, culture and religions. The Senegalese government and the Senegalese media seem to be engaged in a war of nerves will little Gambia, accusing her of all kinds of things. All of this was sparked off first by the arbitrary closure of the border, denying Gambian businessmen the opportunity to transship their goods through Senegalese territory to landlock Mali and other neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Senegalese have said they took the action to prevent smuggling of goods from The Gambia into Senegal, which Dakar claims was &quot;undermining&quot; the Senegalese economy. Talks have been going on between the two nations, at ministerial level, but until now the problem persists. But, of course, the Senegalese border is wide open to allow Gambian groundnuts into Senegalese factories. The transshipment trade has traditionally been one of the main sources of revenue for The Gambia; so quite naturally, the Gambian economy has been hard hit by the border closure. And Senegal seems to be enjoying every minute of it. Two months ago a Senegalese newspaper said social unrest was brewing in The Gambia because the country had fallen on hard economic times, due to the border closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now the Senegalese media is harping on an extraordinary new theme: that The Gambia is arming Cassamance rebels! The Senegalese ambassador in The Gambia has, of course, denied any knowledge whatsoever of these allegations and insisted that they did not come from his government, but from a private newspaper. But clearly, some segments of that country's media are nursing Dakar's anger with Banjul and are bent on taking it to jingoistic proportions. But to what end? Do they want to see the Gambian economy come to a complete standstill? Do they want to see The Gambia de-stabilised? How can trouble in The Gambia help Senegal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We urge The Gambia Government to invite the Senegalese government and the Senegalese media to send a fact-finding mission here to investigate theses allegations and report their findings to the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gambia is a peace-loving country, trying its utmost to live at peace with all her neighbours, especially Senegal, whose friendship and co-operation she has always cherished and cultivated. At the same time, The Gambia is striving very hard to cope with the consequences of the border closure and all the other economic, political and social difficulties that afflict the sub-region and the entire African continent. Meanwhile, the country is endeavouring to maintain the democracy, peace and stability that have earned her, small and weak though the country is, the respect and admiration of the world. But this seems not to be good enough. Here is our big sister across the border hitting persistently at us, throwing stones she knows we cannot bear, for reasons known only to herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet The Gambia can never be a threat to Senegal., After all, she &quot;is&quot; our big sister, 8.8 times bigger in population, 18.4 times bigger in land size, and 23.9 times bigger than The Gambia in Gross National Product (GNP).  It is like Germany, Europe's most powerful nation, with 80.6 million people and a GNP of US$1.8 trillion, hitting at Luxemburg, a tiny country with 350,000 people and a GNP of a meagre US$9.6 billion. No! Far from it, Germany sits at the same round table with Luxemburg, both as equal and sovereign member states of the European Union, helping each other in every possible way. Why on earth can't Africa learn that it is through hate and wickedness toward on another that we have robbed ourselves of what was billed as &quot;the African century&quot;, and flushed out, for the foreseeable future, our own liberation, self-reliance and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the name of Allah, we call n Senegal to stop kicking her little sister who is trying to remain a good and friendly neighbour. Let her remember, too, that Allah is a God of justice, and has His own way of protecting the weak from the strong.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The First Lady, Mrs. Janet Museveni, broke down and wept on seeing the sickly looking kids, maimed and with the look of horror in their eyes. Many of the kids were themselves crying.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Museveni even gave up her earlier plans to talk to journalists.  She left the airport still in tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The kids had arrived in a convoy of mini buses from Rwanda's Gahini Hospital and Muhura orphanage in Byumba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Captain Mike Mukula of Speedbird Aviation, who coordinated the operation, was himself in a sombre mood as he paced up and down to see off the kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The children were between two months and eight years old. The children who arrived in Uganda by road were picked up from Entebbe by an Italian Boeing 737. They were headed for an orphanage in Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The kids were a most pitiful sight. Even onlookers brave enough not to shed a tear, could not help muttering in anger under their breath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One kid, Budeyi, told &quot;The Monitor&quot; that he had been picked from a heap of decomposing human flesh where he had been for four days. He said when the &quot;Interahamwe&quot; (MNRD's youth-wingers) struck at dawn, his parents were dragged out and hacked to death. His mother was killed first. Then the baby on her back. The his father...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was all chaos as people tried to run for their lives. A bullet his Budeyi in the arm and he fell. Other bodies mowed down by gunfire or machetes fell over him. The children were escorted from Rwanda by RFP's prime minister designate, Jack Bihozagara. He said more orphans will be picked and taken to the Italian orphan NGO &quot;Together For Peace Foundation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The kids were received by Mrs. Mariapia Fanfani, the Foundation's director and wife of former Italian premier, Fanfani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The next time round Mrs. Fanfani shall pick 30 of the remaining 80 children also maimed, but still in Byumba.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TELL, April 18, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If wishes were horses, Cameroun would have probably caused the month of March to last for more than &quot;only&quot; 31 days. March was the month when France, its colonial master, took its turn to occupy the Presidency of the United Nations Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Cameroun's design was to take advantage of the French Presidency at the council to press its quest for global intervention in its festering border stand-off with Nigeria, over the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, Cameroun's two letters persuading the security council to convene an urgent meeting on the border row could not draw any responses from the UN body before the expiration of French Presidency March 31.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a last ditch effort, Paschal Bilo Tang, the country's permanent representative at the UN, transmitted to the Security Council, the full text of a communique issued by the conflict resolution organ of the Organisation of African Unity, OAU, which met in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on March 24, this year, with a view to getting the matter listed by council an urgent crisis while France held the body's presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the communique, the OAU central organ on the mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution expressed grave concern about the implication of the escalating border crisis and noted with satisfaction, the willingness of the two parties to engage in a negotiated truce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This strategy (of pressurising the UN) may not achieve much as the Nigeria-Cameroun conflict is currently not on the agenda of the Security Council as a threat to International Peace and Security a diplomatic source in the Nigerian Mission at the UN assured the News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Cameroun has remained relentless in its efforts to snatch the oil-rich island from Nigeria. For now, the battle ground has shifted to the International Court of Justice at the Hague, where it has filed a suit against the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cameroun is praying the World Court to rule that it has sovereignty over Bakassi Peninsula and that Nigeria has violated International Law by using force against Cameroun to take full possession of the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cameroun further asked the court to order Nigeria to withdraw its troops stationed at the Peninsula and pay reparations to Cameroun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although no date has been fixed for hearing, the two countries have signed written declarations to accept the verdict of the legal arm of the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their undertaking to accept the court's jurisdiction came in the wake of apparent failure of the directive from the OAU conflict resolution committee, that both parties pull out their troops from the border to pave the way for a truce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Paul Biya is scheduled to embark on a string of diplomatic shuttles to Britain, France, USA and China, in order to drum up what he considers necessary diplomatic support capable of swaying world court opinion in favour of his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although details of the global tour and itinerary were yet to be released at the time of going to press last week, the game plan, according to foreign affairs analysts, is to exploit to Cameroun's advantage, current cold relations between Nigeria and Western democracies following the annulment of June 12 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of its diplomatic posturing, security sources further say that Cameroun is secretly consolidating its military position as a last resort in the border feud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just as France was stepping out the presidency of the Security Council, the Nigerian army alerted the global community that it had uncovered the clandestine motive behind the joint Franco-Beninois military manoveures between March 6 and 11 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Okon Edet Okon, a colonel and army spokesman, said in a statement, that the five-day joint military exercise was in fact, an operational rehearsal to prepare ground of eventual French involvement in support of Cameroun in the event of an outbreak of war with Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the army spokesman, French participants in the exercise, drawn from the highly motivated Rapid Deployment Force, RAR, came with sophisticated weapons and armaments, few of which were left behind in Benin and majority of which have been diverted to Cameroun for possible attack on Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Of great significance is the fact that the defence adviser to Benin republic including that of Nigeria were invited merely to the closing ceremonies, rather than the actual scenes where French forces and equipment were used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But exactly how innocent is Paris of these scorching charges? The French ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Garrique Guyonnaud was said to have travelled home when TELL called for his comments at the French Embassy last week. The embassy's information officer said over the telephone that only the ambassador can comment on the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, speculation is rife in security circles that a significant percentage of the 304 millions US dollars or about 1.75 billion CFA Francs recently allocated by France to finance education, health and job creation projects in Cameroun will, indeed, be channelled to fund joint Franco-Cameroun military adventure in the volatile Bakassi Peninsula.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH, May 2, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a warm and moving scene for staff of Newswatch Communications, Ltd., NCL, and its subsidiaries April 18 when their three directors returned from Ikoyi prison where they had spent six long days. Recollecting the reception, Dan Agbese, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Newswatch&quot; said: &quot;I was overwhelmed. I felt really encouraged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the trio, Ray Ekpu, the chief executive officer, CEO, of NCL, Yakubu Mohammed, the deputy CEO, and Agbese, their prison experience will remain indelible in their memory, not so much for what they suffered but for what they saw. The injustice and lawlessness in the country shocked them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the three had all been detained before, their six-day stay in Ikoyi prison was their first stint in jail. It was like a rite of passage and as Agbese put it &quot;it opened the biggest unknown in my life, which is jail and which everybody is afraid of. Having been in there an out, the last wall of fear has been broken down.&quot; The prison is no longer an unknown world to them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the directive of Sani Abacha, the head of state, had been obeyed, the three editors would have spent just two nights in jail. On Thursday, April 14, Abacha had ordered that they be released but the prison authorities would not let them go. They had no written order from the government to effect the release. It seemed Olu Onagoruwa, the minister of justice, who should have taken the necessary steps for their release was not in a hurry to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gani Fawehinmi, their lawyer, anticipating that government will resort to unnecessary bureaucracy in releasing them, had issued a statement April 15 outlining how the presidential fiat could be effected. Four days later, he, along with a team of lawyers, trooped to the federal high court in Lagos and prayed the judge to grant them an order restraining the government from further detaining the editors. They also made an application for the immediate release of the editors. At exactly 2.10 pm, April 18, the three directors became free men again. Less than an hour later, they reunited with their staff and later with their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The road to prison started from the Calabar international airport for Ekpu as he was waiting to board a flight to Lagos. He was whisked away by the state security service, SSS, agents at about 6.35 pm. April 18 on the excuse that the SSS director wanted to see him. But when he arrived the office, the director was not there. He was put in a small room furnished with a chair and serviced by a stinking toilet that had no water and no tissue paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the room, Ekpu had to struggle with mosquitoes. The mosquitoes won and chased him out. &quot;They were rather big,&quot; Ekpu chuckled last week when he talked about his room-mates. Nobody thought of giving him food and when he requested for something to eat, somebody went to town in search of food but returned two hours later with nothing. According to the security officer, he could not find food to buy in Calabar, a town noted for its delicacies. The following day, after a brief meeting with the SSS director, Ekpu was sandwiched in a station-wagon to Lagos, straight to the Awolowo Road detention camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Compared to his cell in Calabar, what he got in Ikoyi was a palace.  There were three chairs, a table and an airconditioner that generated heat and noise rather than cold air. The mosquitoes had already colonised the room and he had to wage a war against them with mosquito coils. Unlike in Calabar, he was also provided with food. At meal time, somebody would &quot;bring N15 and ask me what I wanted.&quot; The first day, he asked for bread and groundnut. In subsequent days, he ate &quot;mama put&quot; (food sold by roadside food vendors).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from a glimpse he caught of Agbese on Sunday, April 10, Ekpu was not allowed to see his colleagues until Wednesday, April 13. The reunion was brief but barely an hour later, the three became inmates at Ikoyi prison.  Ordinarily, only Agbese should have been arrested since the issue that led to their arrest was an editorial matter, but Ekpu and Mohammed were hurled along as well although they had stepped aside from the editorial department of NCL.  &quot;They apparently wanted to make it look bigger than it was,&quot; Ekpu observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prison life reminded the chief executive that &quot;all military regimes have the same complexion. None is humane.&quot; It also sensitised him to the need to fight for democracy that will make all freedom possible. He is convinced that outside a civilised system, there can be no free press and &quot;that is why the press must join human rights groups and other people to fight against military rule.&quot; Would he allow the kind of interview that got him and his colleague into trouble to be published again? &quot;Sure,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a good interview. It gave chapters and verses and the government has not contradicted anything David Mark said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the federal government reacted to the interview which laid bare the secret agenda of the Abacha government was not a surprise. Mohammed, former managing editor of &quot;Newswatch&quot; and how deputy CEO of NCL, expected government in 1994 couldn't do better.&quot; The best way to handle the matter, he said, would have been for government to address the fundamental issues raised and to allay the fears of the public. Instead, it resorted to trading abuses and the usual clamped-down on journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Mohammed, his troubles with security men started on Friday, April 8. He had just left the office of the Kogi State administrator in Lokoja when Chris Okolie, a lawyer and magazine publisher, told him about the arrest of Agbese. As Mohammed was about to follow Olusola Akanmode, secretary to Kogi State government and his friend and school mate at government secondary school, Okene, to his office, a security agent stopped him. The agent said the SSS state director wanted to see him. Mohammed was then accompanied by four security agents to see the security boss. He was detained by the security operative in Lokoja. The following day, he was driven to Lagos to join Agbese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As traumatic as the experience was, Mohammed says he holds nothing against the security agents. &quot;They were nice, they were human beings,&quot; he insists. Although he was confined to a room where mosquitoes held sway, he says it was not the fault of the security operatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike Ekpu who was isolated, Mohammed later shored a room with Agbese, but they still had to content with boredom. &quot;It is difficult to handle boredom if you have been busy all your life,&quot; he realised during their detention. He describes the nights they spent in detention as &quot;our longest nights.&quot; They were nights when they could not sleep because of mosquitoes, heat and dysentery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ikoyi prison gave him a reprieve. There he could go to a mosque built by Umaru Shinkafi to pray, play games and interact with other prisoners.  Although he lost a game of table tennis, he was able to defeat Agbese in the game of Ludo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Looking back two days after he walked into freedom, Mohammed said his faith in God kept his spirit up. &quot;I remembered that they (Abacha and his junta) were not God although they could pretend to be. They were not God. &quot;He has already put his experience behind him and is not regretting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agbese too does not regret having his name on the list of those who have been hosted by Ikoyi prison. After seven difficult days in SSS detention camp, the five days at Ikoyi prison were not so bad. From the first night at &quot;Hollywood&quot; detention centre somewhere in Ikoyi to the last day at the Awolowo Road cell, he had to sleep on the floor. &quot;It was rough, very rough,&quot; he recollected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the time he was moved from the security cell, he had blotches all over his body from mosquito bites. He was not surprised when he had malaria in prison. A daily bath which he used to take for granted, was a luxury while he was in detention. In seven days, he bathed only twice because there was no bathroom and no water. The two times he bathed he had to beg for water and had to do it openly, in the dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move from detention camp to the prison yard was swift. The three editors were simply whisked to the Igbosere magistrate court on April 13, and within 10 minutes the magistrate had ordered that they be remanded in prison custody for two weeks to give him time to decide whether he should grant them bail or not. Agbese thinks the high-handedness displayed was to teach them &quot;who is the boss, who is stronger and to prove that even if the pen is mightier than the sword, the sword can still hold sway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were many things to show that the sword was momentarily mightier. He had no access to paper or pen. He could not write and often he could not sleep because of the heat. For three days, he was alone and was denied visitors. Two books, &quot;The Prize&quot;, which he describes as an interesting story of oil, and a Bible were his only companions until Mohammed joined him.  In prison, the three directors were put in one cell which made their five-day stay bearable. Apart from reading and playing games with other prison inmates, they also had unlimited time to chat. Ekpu was in charge of mosquito control, Mohammed was responsible for supply of water while Agbese took care of brewing tea and keeping the cell tidy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike their detention days, the editors slept on proper beds, Ekpu and Mohammed were assigned to a double decker. When Ekpu tried to climb on the bunk, the bed threatened to fall apart, so he had to relinquish the top to his deputy. He slept under. In prison, they also had access to water which was a luxury while they were in detention. After days of going without a bath, they were able to bathe regularly again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Agbese, the 12 days he was locked up helped him to appreciate a few things including water. He was reminded that the hazard of journalism is real, that &quot;you don't have to be a criminal to be treated like one&quot; and that the level of injustice and lawlessness in Nigeria is more serious than he ever thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the editors recollect their days of imprisonment, what will stand out may not be their ordeal but the ordeal of the inmates they met and left behind. Agbese said what he saw in prison was a shame to Nigeria. In a prison meant for 800 people, there are 1,600 people crammed together. Three quarters of them are awaiting trial and some have been there for 10 years and their cases have not even been mentioned let alone tried. The editors were shocked by the large number of juvenile offenders, some as young as 13 years who were arrested for hawking and charge for attempting to commit felony. The three editors left prison with the determination to fight for prison reforms. &quot;I hope to be able to sue both my personal resources and the magazine to fight for reforms,&quot; Agbese promised. The other directors are behind him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If they succeed then their detention would have served a useful purpose.</SPAN></P>

Researchers are requested to explore problems directly related to grassroots development and to make concrete recommendations that can be of assistance to development project promoters in the community. ADF provides grants for research initiated and conducted by African academics, development specialists, students and community groups. Researchers are encouraged to be creative in selecting their theme and to focus their research on issues which are crucial to the development of their countries. In 1994, ADF will allocate approximately US $675,000 to research project funding.  Four types of fellowships will be awarded: Gray postgraduate fellowships (deadline August 1, 1994); Be applied research fellowships (deadline August 1, 1994); Grants for transfer of knowledge (no deadline); Leland development fellowships (deadline January 1, 1995).

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SUNDAY NATION, MAY 22, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Self-Defense Units have played a sterling role in the protection of our communities in the past three to four years.  They succeeded where the formal law enforcement agencies failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, their very existence was made necessary by the gross incompetence on the part of the police to protect communities against the bloodletting pursued by political retards who were determined to stall the inevitable democratic victory we scored so recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The role of these SDUs was indeed noble.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when noble imperatives such as the defense of our communities are shoved aside in pursuit of narrow group and even personal objectives, society needs to step back and take serious stock of itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when the pursuit of these narrow selfish objectives result in senseless carnage of the type we saw in Thokoza last Friday, society needs to step in and bring the full weight of its moral being to bear on the guilty.  What is amply apparent is that the SDUs have, in some cases, decayed into bands of criminals masquerading as defenders of our communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it has until now been difficult, if not impossible, to rip off the mask from the criminal elements in the SDUs and expose them to the communities they have begun terrorizing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conditions have, however, changed dramatically in the past few weeks and we can no longer tolerate explanations and excuses that in the past justified the secrecy behind which these criminals thrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two priorities must therefore be pursued with great vigor if we are to deny these criminals the space to further terrorize our communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First and unquestionably the most important is the need to introduce the element of transparency.  To achieve this objective we must move with all haste to begin building a culture of community policing in which the authority of victims of past excesses will reign supreme.  In the process, the SDUs must be brought above ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, we must disarm the SDUs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neither of this will be easy. There is still a great deal of suspicion, and justifiably so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of SDUs have in the past been forced to operate clandestinely mainly because of the threat they faced from the formal police units themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is no secret that an open war raged between the Internal Stability Division of the police and the SDUs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Identifying an SDU member under these circumstances was tantamount to passing the death penalty on such a person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Removing these fears will take a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And this will impact on the willingness of SDU members to surrender their weapons and subject themselves to the authority of the communities they serve in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Be this as it may, we can no longer delay the process of immobilizing the criminals festering in the SDUs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Transparency and accountability to the community is the only guarantee against criminals pursuing narrow selfish objectives at the expense of township residents; if we fail, a repeat of the Thokoza executions is a certainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the responsibility of ensuring transparency is, in great part, also a responsibility of the new government, which must ensure that the police are kept on a short leash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only this will help erode the suspicion that will otherwise continue to provide the justification for the continued existence of clandestine defense units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Disregard for the law, whatever quarter it emanates form -- the police or the SDUs -- must therefore be dealt with firmly and without compassion.  However, in advocating the disarming and disbanding of the SDUs, we must also stress that they have an important contribution to make towards developing a new policing culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than anyone else, the SDUs have developed an understanding of the needs of their communities and their preferences when it comes to policing.  This is an experience that must be incorporated into cultivating the culture of community policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The possibility, therefore, of incorporating members of the SDUs into a new police force must not be rejected out of hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The temptation to do so will, however, be great given the Thokoza experience.  But if we discarded the SDUs altogether, we would have also failed in our desire to weed out and isolate the criminal factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jackboot culture of the SAP alone will not help a great deal in developing a new set of law enforcement imperatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We must also warn that if we fail to rein in the police and the SDUs, safety and security will remain empty slogans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consequent instability will not help mend the social fabric that has been all but destroyed by apartheid violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And this in turn will render all our efforts at reconstruction and development sterile.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, May 24-27, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem at the heart of Rwanda's tragedy was captured by a subscript at last weekend's mass burials of some of the thousands of bodies from the carnage in the country which have been washed over Lake Victoria into Rakai and Masaka districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> British High Commissioner to Uganda, Mr. Edward Clay, said the Rwanda massacres, in which up to 500,000 non-combatant civilians are estimated to have been killed, was a shame to the people of Africa and an indication of backwardness and underdevelopment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yes, the last 30 years have been dog years. Democracy has all but disappeared from the continent. The more common form of government are one-party, or military dictatorships.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearly all the African governments have turned into rule by a single tribe, and made corruption a model of government. The results are everywhere; bankrupt treasuries, famine, abject poverty, disease, ignorance and bloody fights over the national cake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But you would never have guessed that the savagery in African politics is created by fights over the dwindling national cake, if Col. Kahinda Otafire -- CA delegate, Chairman of the Pan-African Movement and Chief of the External Security Organisation had also not spoken at the same occasion where Clay unveiled the shame of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otafire said the madness in Rwanda was an African tragedy with &quot;historical roots in world politics.&quot; In other words colonial policy of countries like Britain, which thrived by institutionalising division among the African people, must also shore the blame. It sounds like an old-fashioned Pan-Africanist argument, but it is still valid nevertheless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otafire also warned that the Rwanda tragedy is also born of governments adopting policies of &quot;identifying a section of its population as a national enemy.&quot; There are a few Ugandans who can now sleep soundly after hearing a top NRM man say that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We think that the genocide in Rwanda was the result of extreme prejudice, fear and too much anger. This happens when the rulers try to justify and cling on their privileges by invoking the superiority of their tribe, clan or ideology -- and by demonising those who hold a different opinion from theirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Or when the oppressed revolt, driven by a sense that everything the oppressors touched, the women they married, the children they bore are an evil to be wiped off the face of the earth -- and that it's their historical destiny to execute that task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None of these grave shortcomings cannot be cured by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">democracy: Allow the people to profess their faith, to proclaim their political beliefs without undue obstruction, to work and to make a profit without the government stealing it from them, to enjoy access to national resources irrespective of their tribe, race, religion or political party. In case anyone had forgotten the consequences of the failure to do this from our recent history, there is now the macabre reminder from Rwanda. It could have chosen no better a time than when we are discussing the new constitution to come.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following speech was delivered to The African-American Institute in New York, NY on May 24, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Friends,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN Officials,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your Excellencies,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and Gentlemen,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you very very much for this opportunity to speak today with you about Africa and its future. There is simply no subject on earth that is more important. As Ms. Derryck so correctly mentioned, it is a continent of contrasts today. In South Africa, after decades of racial separation, vast inequities, inequalities, conflict, there is a reaching out of hands in the spirit of unity and reconciliation. We join in applauding these historic accomplishments. Then, there is Rwanda, where we witness with horror the degeneration of ethnic conflict into barbaric acts of destruction and mayhem.  We must condemn these atrocities in the strongest possible terms. I fear that the international community has merely watched as this horror has unfolded into genocidal proportions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever is done there, it will almost certainly be too little, I fear, and it is already too late. Three days before the place crash that killed the Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, Oxfam reported that more than 850,000 people -- one eighth of the population of that country -- urgently needed food to prevent starvation due to the drought. Six months before this occurrence, UNDP had met with the country's main donors and urged them to relax conditions that would have enabled us to proceed with a program of demilitarization and resettlement. This agreement was not achieved. Virulent ethnicity and virulent fundamentalism flourish under conditions of rapidly declining opportunity. Where the State is the primary and sometimes the only source of social power, prestige, and comfortable lives, it will be fought for fiercely, often to the death. Where true power resides with military authorities, we can expect that on occasion they will use the means at their disposal. And the means have been increasing unfortunately. One diplomat on the scene in Rwanda was quoted as saying, &quot;Blood has been in the air for months&quot;. But, still, the arms kept flowing in. Since the end of the cold war, affluent nations' arms merchants have compensated by dumping arms into the developing world, including Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The events in South Africa and Rwanda epitomize the contrasting situations across Africa today -- hope and despair, progress and destruction, decency and depravity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One might say that history has not been fair to Africa, and that is, indeed, true. Two externally imposed experiences -- the slave trade and colonialism -- interrupted the process of indigenous state formation and the development of the several great empires of the region and introduced artificially imposed systems of administration and production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We conveniently forget Africa's history. We forget the transatlantic slave trade that robbed Africa of about 12 million of its able bodied men and women. We forget the colonialism which followed the slave trade introduced a system of exploitation of Africa's natural resources to feed the industries of the West. We forget that the Colonial Conferences of Berlin which crudely balkanized and divided Africa into geographic areas of control by the West, with scant regard to the ethnic boudaries and groupings. We even forget that during the period of the cold war's geopolitical fight for spheres of influence, Africa became a focal point for the ideology and the arms that today contribute to the havoc we find in Rwanda and Burundi, in Zaire, Angola and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even independence, which restored self-rule and self-determination to Africa, was unable to counter these long-term effects of history. It could not reverse the character of Africa's state systems that resulted from an arbitrary forging of nations from disparate tribes and ethnic groups. This set the stage for the many conflicts that we see today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet for two decades, improvements in Africa were in fact impressive.  Particularly for a region that for the most part became independent states only thirty five years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gains in education and health, in communication and roads, and in housing and water supply were no less than those achieved by other regions at similar stages of their development. From 1960 to 1980 average Gross National Product growth rates exceeded those of population growth rates. And the period 1967-1974 was a particularly successful one for African growth, with average GDP growth rates of 6 percent. Even greater improvement occurred with regard to social indicators. Primary school enrollment nearly doubled from 41 per cent to 79 per cent during this period. Under five mortality rates dropped from 300 to 200 per 1,000 between 1960 and 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even in the area of democracy and political pluralism, progress has occurred. In the last three years, twenty-four African countries have embarked upon programmes to improve the national climate of politics and governance. This year alone, twelve countries are scheduled to hold elections in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, despite the gains, the challenges Africans face today are truly unprecedented by any standard. Today the total wealth of Africa, which has twice the population of the United States, is little more than that of Belgium. At the World Bank's projected growth rates for Africa, Africans will have to wait two generations to reach even the standard of living they had in 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In too many countries, poor governance continues to impede reform and development, thereby reducing domestic savings and discouraging domestic and foreign investment. Too many Africans remain marginalized in their own countries. Too many face repression and deprivation and torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The economic performance of the region in the sixties and seventies was not sustained, and, in fact, real per capita incomes fell during 1981-93 at over 1 per cent a year. It is estimated that half the people in Africa south of the Sahara will be living in absolute poverty by 2000. Despite its capacity to feed itself, Africa is the only region to produce less food per capita today than at the beginning of the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The developing world received about 32% of direct foreign investment in 1992. Africa received 2%. Evidence of the brain drain out of Africa is equally alarming. In Ghana, for example, it's estimated that 60% of the doctors trained in the early 1980s have left the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then there's the social challenge -- the need to bring under control the rapid population and urbanization growth, which contribute to the grave social conditions that give rise to the many jobless unemployed who are ready participants in civil unrest. The statistics are telling. The maternal mortality rate in Sub-Saharan Africa at 700 per 100,000 live births is the highest in the world. Average years of schooling at 1.6 in 1992 was the lowest in the world. Life expectancy at birth at 51 years in 1992, is still the lowest in the world. The number of chronically undernourished in Africa continues to increase, from 100 million in 1969-71 to 168 million in 1990.  And this figure is projected to double by 2010 when perhaps a third of the African people will suffer chronic undernutrition, according to FAO estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, at this critical juncture in the continent's history, we should ask ourselves what steps should Africa be considering, and what can the international community do to encourage African initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a given that the primary responsibility for the development of Africa rests with Africa itself. As Professor (Adebayo) Adedeji has written, &quot;Africa must grapple with the reality of developing itself primarily through reliance on its own resources, no matter how difficult that might be.&quot; In this regard, Africa's tenacity in staying the course of appropriate economic reforms, thereby laying the foundation for growth or expansion in production, should provide the base for an increase in the jobs and incomes that are necessary for development. But economic reforms alone will never be enough; nor will a myopic fixation on aggregate indicators of national economic growth and performance. Governments must not worship at the altar of GNP.  It's the quality of life for people and the quality of the environment on which the people depend that truly matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa can therefore move a step further, I believe, adopting those policies and programmes that center on people and on sustaining the resource base. In UNDP, we call this goal sustainable human development. It's development that doesn't merely generate growth, but distributes its benefits equitably. It's development that regenerates the environment rather than destroying it. It's development that empowers people rather than marginalizing them. It's development that enlarges people's choices, enlarges their opportunities, providing for the participation in the decisions that affect their lives. In short, it's development that's pro-poor, pro- jobs, pro-nature, and central to all of that, pro-women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To achieve sustainable human development, economic reforms, economic adjustments must be complemented by equally powerful initiatives to ensure that economic growth benefits the poor more than the rich, that it is job-led growth, and that the environment is protected. We at UNDP are committed to working with African countries in an urgent search for this package of complementary initiatives -- not a one-sided macro-economics-only agenda -- but a balanced agenda for the people. We will work with Africa to try to ensure that this more complete agenda receives as much international support as economic reforms and ajustments have received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The good news is that Africans are insisting on political liberalism and better governance in their societies. Many have already begun to take the hard measures to mobilize and efficiently allocate domestic resources. I believe this new approach is consistent with Africa's own prescriptions and initiatives as called for in the Lagos Plan of Action, The African Charter for Popular Participation in Development, the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community, all of which point in the right direction. They need now to be transformed into living programmes of action, with the full support and the unstinting backing of the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And now to the international community -- what should we do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let me suggest that as great as it seems, the needs of Africa are moderate and well within the means of the international community. Helping Africa to succeed is a do-able proposition! For example, the $30 billion in annual flows called for by the New Agenda for African Development (UN-NADAF) represent less that 1 per cent of the GDP of the smallest economy of the G-7 member states. We have yet to achieve this since the New Agenda for African Development was launched in 1991. In fact, the trend suggests a slight decline. After a peak of $25.7 billion in 1990, ODA flows fell to $25.1 billion in 1991 and $24.8 billion in 1992. Enhanced and assured flows are needed to consolidate African development gains. And it would be unfortunate in the extreme if, in the push for the legitimate needs of other regions, Africa's urgent call for development assistance is crowded out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The quality of assistance, and not merely the quantity, to Africa has also got to improve. In the May 1994 issue of &quot;The Economist&quot;, in noting the transfer since 1960 of some $1.4 trillion (in 1988 dollars) of aid from the rich countries to the poor, &quot;The Economist&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">asked: Has this aid been properly used? Has it relieved poverty? Has it stimulated growth? And our &quot;Human Development Report&quot; at UNDP has raised similar questions. And the data are not encouraging. In sub-Sahara Africa in the 1980s, only $1 of development assistance went to primary school pupils compared with $575 to each university student. And I might add, at UNDP, we know we must do a better job in our capacity building work in Africa and elsewhere, and address our own shortcomings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I must, therefore, take this occasion to issue an urgent plea to the OECD donor countries to review their priorities, with the goal of elevating dramatically the support given to international development cooperation in general and the support given to Africa in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Together we've got to tackle the very, very difficult job of rekindling public support for development assistance. Logically, it shouldn't be that hard a job, for non of the goals that the world community is addressing today -- not peace, not human rights or democratization, not environmental protection, not reduced population pressures, not disease control, -- none of these can be achieved except in the context of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, despite the centrality of development to the concerns that capture the political energies today, international support for development is under attack and is threatened, perhaps as never before. The threat comes from many sources, including aid fatigue, competing domestic priorities, sluggish economies; perhaps above all from a lack of public understanding in the donor countries. The resources being devoted to peacekeeping, to humanitarian relief, and to support for political and economic reforms in the former Soviet Bloc are all increasing; the support for development assistance in the poorer countries is hardly increasing at all. If you adjust for inflation it's about about holding constant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armed conflicts and humanitarian emergencies fill the daily headlines and attract resources, and for good reason. Yet, underlying many of these tragic events are the silent crises of underdevelopment, of chronic and growing poverty, of mounting populations pressures and widespread environmental deterioration. And as efforts to respond to acute crisis through peacekeeping, humanitarian relief, assisting refugees grow larger, so must our efforts to respond to the silent crisis through the promotion of sustainable human development. It is far cheaper, more humane, more effective to act preventively, to address the root causes rather than the tragic symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Which brings me to the urgent requirement for the international community to assist African in the area of peace building and conflict prevention. Civil war and strife have been major constraints for the development of many African countries. Already one third, or sixteen, African countries are involved in one form or another of civil conflict. There are over six million refugees in areas beyond their own borders. An additional 17 million are internally displaced. There is simply no way that development can proceed under these conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conflict and wars claim resources that would otherwise be spent on education and health and housing and other areas of development. An estimated per capita public expenditure on the military in Sub-Saharan Africa averaged $11 in 1990, compared with $13 in education. In one African country, the military budget was five times that of the budget for health and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A large part of the blame for this trading in death rests with the industrial countries who, while giving aid on the order of some $60 billion a year, earn an estimated $125 billion per year from the military expenditures of the developing world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the poor countries in Africa, for the poor people in Africa, this madness should be brought to an end. Therefore, I would like to propose the phasing out of all arms trade and military assistance to Africa, over the next three years. This call might form the basis for UN-sponsored talks on how this phasing might be achieved. We should start with a focus on the countries that risk being on the verge of conflict, perhaps Burundi, Zaire, Cameroon, Algeria. Reversely, those states that promote peace, security and development within their borders should be rewarded by the international community with substantially higher levels of development assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Africa, action to change the situation, to address the potential and the emerging conflicts within countries, is, fortunately, already underway. At the June 1993 Annual Summit of the Organization of the African Unity, African Heads of State established a management mechanism in the OAU Secretariat to address such internal conflicts. The mechanism underscores regional ways of preventing political tensions from escalating into armed conflict. Specifically, the mechanism provides for the anticipation and prevention of conflicts, the undertaking of peace-keeping and peace-building activities, including the deployment of civilian and military missions of observation and monitoring in identified crisis-prone countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the OAU lacks both the resources and the capacity to act on these intentions and this good plan. The international community must therefore help, and this means urgent contribution to the OAU Peace Fund which was established for this purpose. Already, the international community has spent $3-4 billion on conflict resolution in the region, and the tab is rising. I believe that a mere 10% of this amount, or $300 to $400 million, provided to the OAU for its Peace Fund would do much more, would get better mileage than the international community has been able to get thus far. I therefore propose and recommend to the international community a $400 million African Peace Fund. The key in this regard is to provide the resources up front -- now -- to enable the OAU to effectively mount pre-emptive responses to potential conflicts. It's not enough to scramble when a conflict is full swing as we have found tragically in the case of Rwanda. We should act preventively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNDP, which is already assisting the OAU with the implementation of the African Economic Community, and assisting several African countries in various governance interventions, would be prepared to help the OAU develop this programme and the terms and conditions to enable them to discharge the responsibilities related to the operation of this important Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More importantly, although facing financial constraints ourselves at UNDP, we are prepared to contribute to this preemptive Peace Fund by providing three million dollars to be used as seed money to strengthen OAU's capacity for the development of the programmes to operationalize the activities envisioned for the Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I would also like to propose that the international community do more to address the issue of African debt. One cannot address the African crisis without addressing the debt issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question of debt relief for Africa has been under consideration for several years, and there have been significant responses on the part of the international community. Some creditor nations have unilaterally canceled a significant portion of the debt to the poorer African countries; and others have provided relief through Paris Club arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, more is required to remove this major constraint on African development. According to the latest report of the OECD, the ratio of sub-Saharan Africa debt stock to GNP was on average 109 per cent, compared with the average of 37 per cent for the developing world as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the least, therefore, the international community, as a first step, should urgently endorse the G-7 Trinidad Terms, which represents the most far- reaching debt relief mechanisms, for application to all African countries, big or small, poor or not so poor. Essentially, these terms would imply a cancellation of two-thirds of all official bilateral debt and a rescheduling of the balance over a longer period of 25 years including a five-year grace period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such an across-the-board approach would provide the necessary breathing space for Africa to launch its sustainable human development strategy and to halt dangerously declining living standards. Moreover, UNDP is considering a mechanism, referred to as the Poverty Dividend Account (PDA), which would require recipient countries undergoing debt relief to commit at least 25 percent of the value of debt relieved towards poverty reduction programmes, aimed at the poorest segments of their population. This proposal would result in a longer term and more comprehensive debt reduction strategy than the ad hoc approach now being used, and importantly, would link debt relief to performance criteria for improving the living standards of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My final word has to do with South Africa. While rejoicing in the political changes that have taken place there, the international community must move quickly to help South Africa succeed in its economic transformation by providing the means to address development needs of the vast number of its citizens who were by-passed by the apartheid system. In doing so, we will not only help South Africa and the people of that nation, but we give impetus to the development of an important growth pole for the entire African subregion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary General recently indicated that UNDP, along with other UN agencies, would be gearing up to respond to South Africa's needs and priorities. We are reviewing our ongoing programmes there, with the Government of South Africa and we expect to present a country programme in South Africa which is directed to meeting the needs of the majority population, whose per capita income is roughly estimated to be no more than $100 compared with the $2,300 officially listed by the World Bank as the national per capita income figure. UNDP will also within six months be co-sponsoring with other donors an international donors' conference that will focus on and mobilize resources for South Africa's human resources development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In closing, let me say that Africa remains for UNDP a region of the utmost importance. Nearly half of our resources are directed towards the region's development and, to a large extent, UNDP's own success will depend on Africa's success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Helping Africa is a doable proposition. Providing annual official flows of assistance of $30 billion is doable. Mobilizing $400 million to support programs aimed at preventing conflict is doable. Implementing a more comprehensive debt relief program is doable. Curbing the arms trade to African nations is doable. Helping South Africa to consolidate its political program, its development goals is doable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I hope that these suggestions will find a positive reception in UNDP's program countries and our donor countries, and I stand ready with my colleagues at UNDP, led by Ms. Johnson-Sirleaf, to work even more assiduously with African governments and African institutions and with the African people in the realization of their development aspirations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you very much for this opportunity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, June 3, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first court challenge to a Publications Appeal Board ruling since 1987 -- by the producers of two safer sex education videos banned 18 months ago -- has raised the curtain on renewed debate about censorship in the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pretoria Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved judgment after stormy argument, mostly technical, about the process by which the Publications Appeal Board (PAB) last year decided to uphold an earlier decision by a Committee on Publications to ban the videos Safer Sex, a Lovers' Guide and Safer Sex for Gay Men and Men who have Sex with Men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Publications Act allows the supreme court only to review the process by which the board reached its ruling, and not the merits of the videos themselves -- whether they are in fact too explicit and transgress the freedom of expression guarantee in the new constitution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Jeff van Reenen of Reel Communications: &quot;What makes this case important is that it centres on a ruling made by the Directorate of Publications in the old South Africa. Today the censor board and the Publications Act are in violation of the new constitution. Ironically, the supreme court may have to uphold this violation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Advocate Gilbert Marcus, representing the producers, said there could be strong grounds for a hearing in the constitutional court if the supreme court challenge fails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Legal argument on Wednesday centred on whether the PAB had given sufficient consideration to the likely audience, and on its treatment of expert evidence submitted to it by Professor Reuben Sher of the South African Institute for Medical Research and Mary Crewe, chief Aids educator of the Johannesburg City Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sher and Crewe endorsed the videos as a step in the right direction by treating Aids education in the context of eroticism and emphasising the pleasures of safer sex rather than staid lecturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was common cause that the board had accepted the expert evidence on the videos' educational value. Marcus argued that the board had not sufficiently considered the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">evidence. Advocate H de Wet, for the board, retorted: &quot;At the end of the day (the board) still has to judge the vehicle in the light of the morals of society.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, June 3, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Goldstone Commission has information linking the new minister of police in kwaZulu/Natal, Celani Mtetwa, to illegal gun-running for Inkatha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources inside and outside the commission confirmed this week that they have information tying Mtetwa to the receipt of weapons from the network alleged to have been set up by renegade South African Police members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police portfolio in the Natal cabinet has been at the centre of this week's battle between the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party in Natal over regional executive positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has also emerged that the government of national unity is keeping new details of the involvement of key former South African Police and IFP officials in political violence under close wraps for fear of the political repercussions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail &amp; Guardian has been leaked the second report of the Transitional Executive Council task group on hit squads in the kwaZulu Police, which names IFP PWV leader Themba Khoza, IFP PWV parliamentarian Humphrey Ndlovu, and 16 senior kwaZulu (KZP) policemen who are said to have taken part in hit squad activity. No action has been taken on this, although it is dated March 29. And a new Goldstone report, which was expected to have been made public, has been sent to the international team investigating the involvement of IFP and SAP officials in &quot;third force&quot; activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This report, dealing with covert operations against anti-apartheid activists, corruption and other criminal activities by policemen, was expected to be released three weeks ago, according to sources in the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources in the commission have confirmed that such a report was drawn up. &quot;There was going to be a report but it was decided it was inappropriate for Goldstone to have his own report now that the international team was investigating,&quot; said a source close to the minister of safety and security.  Goldstone is understood to have discussed the report with the minister, Sidney Mufamadi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Richard Goldstone confirmed his commission had handed over the relevant information to the international team. &quot;All information has been submitted to the international team,&quot; he said. Asked if his commission would produce further reports on the matter,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he said: &quot;It depends very much on what comes out of the international investigation. There may or may not be, I really can't say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second report by the TEC task group investigating hitsquads in the kwaZulu Police recommends the immediate suspension of the deputy commissioner of the KZP, Major General Sipho Mathe, on grounds that he aided and concealed the activities of hit men in the KZP. Among other things, he is accused of &quot;disgraceful conduct&quot; by failing to investigate hit squad claims against three senior Inkatha members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report paints a frightening picture of the systematic concealment, failure to investigate and conniving at hit squad activity in the KZP by senior officers. It recommends the suspension of two KZP brigadiers, CP Mzimela and BL Ndlovu, and a district commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sipho Mdluli. It also calls for charges of defeating the ends of justice to be investigated against LA Hlengwa, a former policeman and currently an IFP head office official in Ulundi. Also recommended is the suspension of two majors, two captains and a lieutenant and the investigation of a brigadier, a major and two captains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The TEC report says an investigation into a massacre at Nqutu, Natal, by a kwaZulu policeman, Lieutenant Mbatha, &quot;revealed that the rest of the suspects were members of a hit squad that operated from hostels in East Rand and that Themba Khoza and Humphrey Ndlovu were involved in the planning of the massacre&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reluctance to take firm action against &quot;third force&quot; suspects reflects differences in both the ANC and the government about how to deal with criminal rightwing elements in the security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the ANC, there are those who are urging a &quot;softly-softly&quot; approach, in an attempt to win these elements over. They appear to have the backing of State President Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others feel the quick removal of those who were involved in orchestrating violence is the only way to finally stop those involved in political destabilisation and get to the bottom of the political violence which has rocked South Africa since 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate around indemnity is also crucial. The authors of the TEC report urge the TEC to grant selective indemnity to witnesses who are prepared to give further details of &quot;third force&quot; activity. They warn that without being able to offer potential witnesses indemnity, there is &quot;little or no prospect of rooting out those orchestrating this significant cause of political violence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has made no substantial moves towards addressing this particular indemnity issue. Senior former South African Police officers are pushing for a blanket indemnity for all political crimes after a cut off date, without disclosure of the crime. They apparently hope this will prevent lower ranking officers from testifying against their seniors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC and human rights activists have been pushing for the full disclosure by those involved in political violence to help them with their investigations At the moment, the government is taking the view that they cannot defy the generals without destabilising the security forces -- something they are not prepared to risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, all Judge Goldstone's witnesses -- the mystery &quot;Qs&quot; who were sent to Denmark for safety in the wake of the release of the &quot;third force&quot; report -- were brought back to South Africa three weeks ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SUNDAY NATION, May 22, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jessie Duarte, MEC in charge of safety and security in the PWV region, which includes the volatile East Rand, says addressing the SDU issue is not an easy matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But she says that, before anyone begins to address the debate, they should examine the background against which the SDUs emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One must understand that the SDUs were set up in a situation in which there was no protection. Communities could not rely on the formal protection units, the South African Police, at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The only protection communities could rely on was that from the SDUs and the South African Defense Force.&quot; Duarte concedes that some of the SDUs now pose a threat to communities. But she hastens to add that rogue defense units -- those infiltrated or set up in the mold of vigilante groups -- are in a minority.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The challenge now is to take all SDUs along in the creation of a new policing culture. Changed conditions now allow for communities to be empowered in the area of policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One entry point for SDUs into the new culture, says Duarte, is through the constitutional provision which provides for the creation of Community Police Liaison Forums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is an opening to bring about a closer link between professional police and the desires of the communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We see the SDUs playing an important role in fostering that kind of community-police liaison,&quot; Duarte says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But she is also mindful of the resistance her department will experience from some SDUs. &quot;I think there are individuals in some of the SDUs who are not going to want to cooperate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This resistance could come from people who are aware that the power of the SDUs will be severely curtailed once they are above ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Duarte is not unduly concerned about such individuals, saying that they will marginalize themselves through their resistance to the new order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another entry point is to formally join the police service, says Duarte. This will give SDU members who are genuinely committed to the protection of their communities the opportunity to ensure, from within, that residents get the kind of policing service they desire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Duarte does not believe that the SDU members -- even those genuinely committed to serving the community -- will make such a transition easily.  There would need to be some indication that the police themselves have shed the baggage of the &quot;old South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there may be some in the police services who feel they cannot share the ideals of the new government and might want to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is only if they commit themselves (SDUs and the police) to a common goal, that they will be able to work together,&quot; Duarte says. She adds that it will be a big loss if either the police or the SDUs decide to remain outside the structures of the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would be a great pity of we lost the professional experiences of the police and the SDUs' informal, but real, experience in community policing.&quot; Defense units have a very real operational understanding of the communities they have been protecting, says Duarte. And this understanding is necessary in building the culture of community policing. &quot;It would be disastrous if we lost that experience,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And I think the formal police accept that they (the police) lack that experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If these two areas of experience are combined, Duarte believes the region could emerge with a formidable public safety and security network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But the ISU (Internal Stability unit) has to change its orientation if we are to succeed. You have 8000 highly skilled police people. But their orientation has to change, and we are say ing that to them quite openly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is very true that the communities saw the ISU as negative, and that goes for the whole fashion of policing -- the knocking down of doors, the breaking of windows, the assaulting of people suspected of crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have the assurances of the generals in the police that they are continuing with their work to reorientate their force, taking in the view that community policing is community protection, rather than instilling fear into the communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While bridging the gap between police and SDUs could see Duarte's vision of a new police force being realized, the challenge of resolving tensions within the defense units remains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Past attempts, such as the January Daveyton Accord, have failed. This makes the challenge more difficult. but Duarte is not perturbed by this failure. She says it is important to recognize the circumstances in which the Daveyton attempts failed. And much of that had to do with the tensions between political organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While conditions have changed, says Duarte, it would be naive to assume that these tensions have disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But there is now a recognition among most political organizations that the arena in which to fight their political battles is in fact the parliament and the provincial legislatures. Very few still believe that these battles have to be resolved by getting people on the ground to kill each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Duarte says it will take a great deal of effort to ensure this recognition that the new terrain of struggle has shifted away from violence.  And much of the responsibility for this rests with the newly elected MECs and parliamentarians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;ANC people at a regional level will soon be meeting with the SDUs to discuss this new reality and the new role that the defense units can play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For my part, I am going to meet every person employed by the police service in this province to ensure that they understand that there is a new perspective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While skeptical of the scale of the success of these efforts, Duarte acknowledges that there is no other option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She nevertheless draws some confidence from conversations she has had with SDU members, who have told her that they are ready for the change.  Police people she has spoken to have expressed the same sentiments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The practical thing to do is to bring them together so that they can talk to each other -- its already happening in some places.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week, Duarte met with a group from Vosloorus on the East Rand, representing the police, civic association and the SDUs, and listened to their proposals about how they could help realize the new vision of community-oriented policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Duarte says a similar meeting was also convened in Soweto, where representatives of the church, the civics and all the police stations in the township met to discuss the community police liaison committees. According to Duarte, the issues being discussed include ways to translate the theoretical vision of community policing into practical reality. &quot;One of the things they are saying is that the first thing to do is to get all people who belong to SDUs together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, given the tensions within and between SDUs, convening such a meeting is not easy. One immediate question, says Duarte, is who should get such a meeting together?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Duarte says there are SDUs from a range of different political affiliations. She says there are not only ANC SDUs, but also PAC and Inkatha defense units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have suggested that the civic assume the responsibility of convening the meeting of SDUs. Civics are not political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the same time, political organizations will also have to urge SDUs to accept the new political order,&quot; says Duarte. This will be important, especially in areas like the East Rand, which was characterized by intense territorial battles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If there is this territorial battle, we have to unite our communities before any meaningful progress can be made towards establishing a community police service committed to the singular purpose of protecting the community.&quot; And, once again, the civic must be the engine to drive this process, says Duarte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this in itself could ignite conflict, as was the case in the Vaal region, where SDUs went to war against each other on the question of who should ultimately take charge of the defense units. Some leaders were violently opposed to the SDUs coming under the command of the civic and were killed as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Duarte, however, says the focus of the debate has now shifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past 30 weeks before the elections, for example, &quot;we had a situation where people felt they needed to won particular areas of our communities, or particular structures.&quot; Political hegemony was so important that it gave relevance to the debates around who the SDUs should be accountable to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't think the se debates are relevant any longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Duarte is also mindful of the fact that debates on the future of the SDUs become irrelevant if police do not take the responsibility for protection of the communities. &quot;That is the bottom line -- who takes this responsibility. &quot;People in the SDUs were protecting communities as volunteers. Communities now need to push the paid public servants to take that responsibility and treat it seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another critical factor on which the success or failure of Duarte's efforts hinge is disarming the communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The importance of this comes into sharp relief given estimates of over a million firearms on the East Rand Alone, says Duarte. &quot;This means there is an average of one firearm in every home.&quot; At the core of the entire debate, however, is the need to accept the principle that the country can only have one formal police force, whose sole purpose must be to protect the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An acceptance of this principle presupposes agreement by the SDUs that they give up their arms and join the formal police force if they still have a commitment to the protection of their communities. Once again, this will not be easy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Food Programme, with considerable support from the Burundi government, today embarked upon an airlift operation between Dar-Es-Salaam and Bujumbura. The operation has been launched to ensure a continuous supply of relief food to the ever growing refugees and displaced population in Burundi, Rwanda and Eastern Zaire. Over the next three weeks, WFP plans to fly in a total of 1500 metric tons of various food commodities, destined to some one million people in the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today's deliveries of 37 tonnes of beans, arrived on a DC 8 aircraft chartered by the US Government on behalf of WFP. Starting this weekend, two Hercules L 100s will also make rotations between the two cities every day, increasing the daily food arrivals to 160 tonnes. Much of this food will be directly off-loaded by trucks and sent immediately to the refugee and displaced in Northern Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Significant quantities of relief food for the Burundi emergency are available in Dar-Es-Salaam port, from where it is usually sent via truck, rail and barge to Bujumbura. For weeks, however, both slow off-take from Bujumbura port as well as limited trucking capacity in the region, created bottlenecks which constrained the flow of relief food. Although the port has improved its handling capacity to 500-600 tonnes a day, an airlift is required to temporarily boost the food supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With was still waging in Rwanda, we can expect a wave of refugees arriving in Burundi and/or Eastern Zaire at any moment,&quot; says WFP Country Director for Burundi, Genimo Lodesani. &quot;Furthermore, food aid deliveries to Southern Rwanda are most easily conducted from here. A sufficient food stock in Burundi is therefore absolutely crucial.&quot; Already there are scattered reports of Rwandan refugees dispersed in the swamp areas along the border between Butare and Kirundo province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the outbreak of civil war in Rwanda, the population in the region in need of food aid has exploded: 75,000 Rwandan refugees and 175,000 Burundis, formerly refugees in Rwanda, have trekked across the borders into the northern provinces of Burundi; 5000 Rwandans along with 18,000 Zairians, who had lived in Rwanda for generations, have fled into Eastern Zaire - 60,000 Burundi refugees and 104,000 displaced are currently living under critical conditions in camps in Southern Rwanda; 600,000 people displaced since the 1993 October massacre in Burundi are still not self- sufficient.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH, May 16, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From Nzeogwu to Abacha, the battle cry is down with corruption, yet the cankerworm grows even fatter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For twenty-four years, the military has arrogated to itself the messianic task of stamping out corruption in Nigeria.  But this self-appointed mission has continued to be a mere wish.  This wish dates back to January 15, 1966, when Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu, a major, took the nation by surprise in his dawn broadcast from Kaduna announcing the first military take-over in the country.  Said he in the broadcast: &quot;...the country's enemies are the political profiteers, the swindlers, the men in high and low places that seek bribes and demand 10 percent, those that seek to keep the country divided permanently so that they can remain in office as ministers or VIPs at least; the tribalists, the nepotists, those that make the country look big for nothing before international circles, those that have corrupted our society and put the Nigerian political calendar back by their words and deeds.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Nzeogwu, it was the with of the military to establish a strong, united and prosperous nation, free from corruption and internal strife.  &quot;Our method of achieving this is strictly military,&quot; he warned.  Since Nzeogwu's coup did not record nation-wide success, it was, therefore, difficult to hold him to his words.  But Johnson T. Aguiyi-Ironsi, a major-general, who took over the reins of power as the most senior military officer around, never mentioned eradication of corruption as part of his agenda.  But in the former Western Region, the military administration seized the property of some former public officers which were said to have been acquired corruptly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six months into his administration, Aguiyi-Ironsi was toppled in a counter-coup of July 29, 1966, which paved way for the emergence of Yakubu Gowon, then a lieutenant-colonel, as head of state.  Said Gowon on assumption of office: &quot;As soldiers, my colleagues and I are ready to go back to the barracks any day.  But the work of national reconstruction must be completed; public confidence in our institutions must be restored; and civilian leaders demonstrate to the nation that they are ready to take over and project a better image of the country than it had just before January 1966.  There are five main issues which the federal military government will deal with in the course of national reconstruction.  The first is the reorganization and long-term re-integration of the Nigerian army...  The fourth is to continue the fight against corruption in public life and the fith is the preparation of a new constitution for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gowon gave his game plan to fight corruption.  Said he: &quot;Regarding the eradication of corruption from our public life, the federal military government will take appropriate action in the reports of the inquiries recently held into the Nigerian Railway Corporation, the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria and the Lagos City Council.  Similar inquiries will be held into other federal corporations.  The decree on the declaration of assets will be implemented and the investigations into the assets and liabilities of those who held public offices from 1960 to 1966 will be continued.  Those involved will include former ministers, chairmen of statutory corporations, board members, permanent secretaries and other senior civil servants, general managers and the executives of public corporations.  The government has been handling these investigations in a quiet way because it does not want to give the impression of witch-hunting.  Those found guilty of ill-gotten gains will be appropriately dealt with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gowon could not implement his wish because of the civil war which broke out a year later after what was then known as Eastern Nigeria attempted to secede from the rest of the country.  But after the war ended January 15, 1970, he renewed the intention of his administration to prosecute the war on corruption.  He drew up a five-year development plan which had a nine-point program.  One of the programs was the eradication of corruption from national life.  But Gowon did not prosecute the anti-corruption war.  Consequently, many of his lieutenants, both military and civilians, took advantage of this to enrich themselves at public expense.  Thereafter, Muhammed set up a commission of inquiry to probe the administration of the eleven governors and the administrator guilty of corrupt practices.  They were made to forfeit to the state the property they corruptly acquired.  In addition, the military governors were summarily dismissed from the services of the armed forces and the police.  Beyond the governors, many top public officers were probed and those found guilty were appropriately punished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Olusegun Obasanjo, then a lieutenant-general, who succeeded Muhammed after the February 13, 1976 abortive coup, pursued the policy of low profile and discipline in public life started by the administration.Like in January 1966, the military under Mohammed Buhari, a major-general, sacked the civilian government of President Shehu Shagari December 31, 1983.  In his maiden broadcast to the nation January 1, 1984, Buhari explained what informed the military take over and listed the goals of his administration.  One of the goals was a war on corruption and indiscipline.  Said he: &quot;While corruption and indiscipline have been associated with our state of underdevelopment, these twin evils in our body politic have attained unprecedented heights in the past four years...  We deplore corruption in all its facets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His riot act was clear and blunt.  &quot;This government will not tolerate kick-backs, inflation of contracts and over-invoicing of imports, etc, nor will it condone forgery, fraud, embezzlement, misuse and abuse of office and illegal dealings in foreign exchange and smuggling.&quot; Like Muhammed, Buhari showed the commitment and political will to prosecute the war, but Ibrahim Babangida threw spanners into his works and overthrew his administration August 27, 1985.  He also threw away the war against indiscipline launched by Buhari.  Said Babangida: &quot;The war against indiscipline will continue, but this time, in the minds and conduct of Nigerians and not by way of symbolism or money-spending campaigns.  This government, on its part, will ensure that the leadership exhibits proper examples.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Babangida never lived up to his words.  His eight-year rule has been characterized as a period when corruption became institutionalized in Nigeria.Like Babangida, Sani Abacha, whose government relaunched the War Against Indiscipline and Corruption, WAI-C, May 4, has promised to lead by examples.  So far, there are only precepts.  In fact, successive military administrations in the country have proved to be no less corrupt than the civilians they overthrew on allegations of corruption.  Will Abacha make the difference?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH, May 30, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the second time in five weeks, the government of Sani Abacha, a general, is facing a major crisis. The first crisis was over an interview with David Mark, a retired brigadier-general, which was published in the April 11 edition of &quot;Newswatch&quot; in which he said Abacha and Oladapo Diya, the chief of general staff, had no plan for democracy until 1999. Now, the government is in a quandary over the political programme which it hurriedly drew up as a response to that interview. Notable politicians are boycotting the ward election planned for this week. Instead they are asking Abacha to release the result of the June 12, 1993, presidential election and swear in the winner as president.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Thursday, the demand led to open confrontation between traditional rulers from the South-West and security agents. The traditional rulers had converged on Ijebu-Ode, in Ogun State, to discuss the boycott of the election. But by 7 a.m. on the day, the whole town had been taken over by armed policemen. Even the toll-gate was blocked by anti-riot policemen who searched every vehicle and everybody who was passing through. A senior police officer who led the operation told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that they had instructions from &quot;very high quarters&quot; to stop people from entering Ijebu-Ode. Festus Adesanoye, Osemawe of Ondo, Adebobayo Adesida, Deji of Akure and three other traditional rulers were refused entry into the town. When Adesanoye insisted on knowing why he and his colleagues were barred from entering the town, he was shown a letter titled &quot;Attempts to disrupt the Constitutional Conference Election.&quot; Signed by Tunji Sokoya, the secretary to the Ogun State government, the letter order the police to halt the meeting of the traditional rulers and other Yoruba leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some other personalities, however, managed to beat the trap and reached the palace of Sikiru Adetona, the Awujale of Ijebuland, venue of the meeting. There they met another shocker. The gate to the palace was blocked by another detachment of policemen led by Abiodun Asabi, an assistant superintendent of police. There, some of the traditional rulers who reached the gate were not allowed to enter the palace. Only those who were with Adetona by 8:30 a.m. entered the palace with him. Adeyinka Adebayo, a retired general and chairman of Egbe Ilosiwaju Yoruba, was the first person to break the rules. He drove in straight into the palace ignoring police signals that he should stop. Shortly after him came Salawu Adekoya, the Ayangburen of Ikorodu. When his driver was disallowed from entering the palace, he was visibly angry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adekoya: Why are you preventing me from entering?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asabi: We are under instruction not to allow anybody into the palace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adekoya: You are not serious. You cannot prevent me from entering the palace which is still in my territory. We will hold this meeting today. If you want to arrest us come and arrest us here. Go and call your commissioner of police to come and arrest us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In annoyance, Adekoya forced his way into the palace. The policemen trailed him into the palace. He turned round and said: &quot;If you follow me again, I will slap you.&quot; Knowing that the traditional ruler was serious, the policeman allowed him in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other notable leaders like Olu Falae, Segun Osoba, Bola Tinubu, Adesuyi Haastrup, former deputy governor of Osun State, were not allowed to enter the palace through the main gate. But they later found an unmanned one through which they entered the palace. Each pretended he was driving off but would drive to the back of the palace, park his car, and enter through the gate into the palace. By 11:00 a.m., the meeting had commenced, catching the police unawares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Expectedly, the traditional rulers threw their weight behind calls for total boycott of the proposed constitutional conference. Said the traditional rulers: &quot;The proposed conference can be for no other reason than to delay giving respect to the will of the people as manifested in the June 12 election.&quot; The traditional rulers quarrelled with the absence of a decree covering the conference, the choice of a constitutional conference instead of a sovereign national conference and the decision to nominate 96 of the expected delegates. &quot;This is not only undemocratic but unacceptable,&quot; they said, adding, &quot;the consultative committee agreed at the meeting to call on all Yoruba to reject participation in the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The danger signal for the May 23 ward election emerged on Sunday, May 15. After a two-day meeting at a private residence in Ikeja, Lagos, a new political group, the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, issued a statement asking Abacha to invite Moshood Abiola, believed to have won the June 12, 1993, presidential election to form a government of national unity.  Made up of such big names as Adekunle Ajasin, former governor of Ondo State, Anthony Enahoro, a former minister, Yohanna Madaki, former governor of Benue and Gongola states, Ralph Obioha, a prominent Igbo politician, Osoba, former governor of Ogun State, and Bolaji Akinyemi, former external affairs minister, NADECO gave the head of state until May 31 to effect its order.  Although, the group did not specify what it would do if the deadline is not met, NADECO described the proposed constitutional conference as a &quot;ruse&quot; planted to ensure continued &quot;military dictatorship, aided by the greed and opportunism of a political clique.&quot; The statement further added: &quot;The military government should stop forthwith all preparations and call off the ill-conceived constitutional conference that will be futile and prove a colossal waste of public funds at this time of untold economic hardship being experienced by the people of Nigeria, including a vast majority of armed forces personnel and the police who are not in government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NADECO also called for the formation of a national government which will restructure the Nigerian polity in order to establish a true federalism, introduce a more justifiable manner of power-sharing and revenue allocation, as well as encourage respect for the fundamental human rights of all Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The initial reaction of the government was to ignore NADECO's ultimatum. According to political experts in government, NADECO's formation and ultimatum may have been influenced by events in South Africa. Their argument, which pleased Abacha and his close aides, was the NADECO was composed of just a faction of the banned Social Democratic Party, SDP. NADECO members from the South-West are all members of the Afenifere, a political group which has its roots in the Egbe Omo Oduduwa. Among such men are Ajasin, Olabiyi Durojaiye, Akin Aduwo, Olufemi Olutoye, Osoba and Akinyemi. Members of the New Dimension like Layi Balogun, Omololu Olunloyo and Bamidele Olumilua, former Ondo State governor, who are said to be favourably disposed towards Musa Shehu Yar'Adua, are not in NADECO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From the Middle Belt, NADECO members are mostly made up of members of the Middle Belt Forum, MBF. They include Dan Suleiman, Jonah Jang, Steven Achema, Madaki and Moses Adasu. Members of the Middle Belt Congress, MBC, a break-away faction of the MBF which is led by Paul Unongo, a former minister of steel, are not members of NADECO. Also absent from NADECO's membership list are members of the Eastern Mandate Union, EMU, which is led by Dele-Cole. Also, no member of the defunct National Republican Convention, NRC, is a member of NADECO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This government was, however, jolted because from then onwards, events began to happen very fast, indicating that the government was losing control of the nation. Abiodun Adetiloye, archbishop of the Anglican Church in Nigeria, fired the first salvo in support of NADECO;s position. He wrote Abacha, asking him to &quot;bow out honorably,&quot; warning that &quot;if you cannot see the handwriting on the wall and bow out, the end may be inglorious.&quot; He said from all indications, Abacha's life-long ambition had been to rule Nigeria, adding, &quot;now that that ambition has been fulfilled, I hope you will not lack sufficient courage to take the right decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government was equally troubled by the decision of traditional rulers from the South-West to advise a boycott of this week's ward election. It was said to have been further alarmed by the formation of National Unity Promoters, NUP, which also has Yar'Adua as a member. The NUP, like the Association for Democracy and Good Governance, ADGG, is made up of friends who are unhappy with the trend of things in Nigeria, especially the acceptance of political appointments in governments by erstwhile proponents of the June 12 election. The NUP is led by Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria's former head of state. A member of the group which will meet on June 4 sees the call for a boycott of the election as &quot;rubbish.&quot; Whatever is the stand of NUP, government is alarmed because &quot;each time Obasanjo leads such a group, the government collapses in a matter of weeks&quot; Government officials were said to have used the last days of the government of former President Ibrahim Babangida as example, saying, &quot;government will either match its words on the ban of political groupings with action or be ready to be rushed out of office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While government was still contemplating how it should react to NADECO's ultimatum, security reports said politicians were gathering in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, for a conference. The two-day conference was to have been addressed by Obasanjo, Theophilus Danjuma, a lieutenant-general and former chief of army staff, Dele-Cole and many other prominent Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Port Harcourt meeting, it was learnt, was halted because of the political implications. According to Aso Rock sources, &quot;the government had been pushed into announcing a political programme because Mark had exposed their plans to stay indefinitely. That is why there is so much vagueness with plans for elections for the constitutional conference.&quot; The fear also was that the Port Harcourt meeting could be sued to further embarrass the government. Said a government source: &quot;In view of the type of people who were to attend that Port Harcourt conference and the call for a boycott of the ward and subsequent elections, then this government would collapse.&quot; But according to Dele-Cole, one of the conveners of the meeting, the conference would have allowed prospective participants at the constitutional conference to discuss serious national issues, especially problems associated with oil revenue, which could emerge at the conference. He asked: &quot;How can you have a system where you are going to discuss how to elect candidates into a forum to discuss the country's constitution and seven days from the election, you still have not discussed oil?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government's reaction to the botched Port Harcourt conference convinced some politicians that, as Mark claimed in his interview, government had no genuine intentions about its political programmes. Very many prominent politicians who had earlier collected nomination forms either refused to submit them or failed to appear before the Constitutional Conference Electoral Commission, CCEC, for screening. Initially, some of them said they would contest buy they would withdraw from the conference if it became obvious that Nigerians did not want it. Olusola Saraki, former senate leader in the Second Republic, who had said he would contest the election, did not present himself for screening. Other notable politicians also announced their boycott of the election. Falae, who was a presidential aspirant of the SDP, announced that he was no more interested in the election. He hinged his withdrawal from the election on two points: the opposition of NADECO to the election and the constitutional conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By Wednesday, last week, opposition to the conference had grown beyond the control of the government. Students of the University of Benin threatened to beat any electoral officer found at the university during the week's election. Their opposition, through, was against government's decision that only Nigerians 35 years of age or above were qualified to contest the delegates election. Five youths, Bola Aguda, 29, Akinboyede Akinola, 31, Bola Aidi, 30, and two others also went to a Kaduna high court challenging the age limit, saying it was a travesty of justice. Tinubu, T.O. Abuede, Rasheed Shitta-Bay, Femi Lanlehin and Busurua Alebiosu, all Lagos politicians, issued a statement supporting &quot;a boycott of the proposed conference&quot; and appealing to &quot;all Lagosians to do the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Support for the boycott also came from a strange quarter, the Catholic Church. Usually conservative in its approach and reactions to political matters in Nigeria, the Catholic Church stepped out of such passiveness last week. Albert Obiefuna, president of the Conference of Catholic Bishops of Nigeria, told pressmen in Lagos that the Catholic Church was in support of a release of the June 12 presidential election. Said he: &quot;The church must speak out when injustice is perpetuated. All we are concerned about is declaring whosoever that won (the election) and that is the stand of the church.&quot; Nigerians in the United States of America also lent their support to the restoration of democracy in the country. A group which calls itself the Nigerian Democratic Awareness Coalition said it was prepared to help in actualising the intentions of those crusading for democracy. In a statement signed by Oye Fasakin and Edward Oparaoji, the group said: &quot;We received with utmost excitement and encouragement statements on the current political impasse in our dear fatherland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At press time, various interest groups were holding series of meetings to adopt their respective line of action. The Afenifere, a political group in the South-West, met in Owo last Wednesday and restated its stand on the boycott of the conference, saying that what it wanted was a sovereign national conference. The Annang, the second largest ethnic group in Akwa Ibom State, as well as the Izon (Ijaw) also announced their withdrawal from the conference. The Annang are unhappy that only two of the nine seats allocated the state went to the group. The Ijaw National Congress, in a communique signed by F.T. Williams, secretary, and J.B. Fumudoh, president, said its members should boycott the proposed conference &quot;as it will not serve the Ijaws any useful purpose.&quot; Last week, Abacha sent Lateef Jakande, works and housing minister, and Ebenezer Babatope, transport and aviation minister, to the west to persuade Yoruba leaders not to boycott the constitutional conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt that the renewed political showdown with the Abacha regime has its roots in the installation of Nelson Mandela as South African president. Al Gore, the US vice-president, and other leaders who attended the ceremony shunned Abacha, preferring instead to hold parlays with Abiola. Most of these world leaders were said to have encouraged Abiola to seize the initiative and chase the military out of power. When he returned from South Africa, Abiola was again pressured by difference groups to form a cabinet and be ready to stake his life, as Mandela did on Roben Island for 27 years, in order to wrest power from the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On May 12, verbal messages were sent to some of the interest groups for a meeting in Lagos. To test public reaction to Abiola's plans, his aides leaked to the press information that he had, indeed, formed a cabinet. The reaction, according to an Abiola aide, &quot;was very encouraging. We were even surprised by the number of inquiries we received from Nigerians.&quot; Somehow, the first meetings of NADECO were infiltrated by security agents. But the final meeting which led to the issuance of a communique was held at a secret location. Some NADECO members who were to attend the meeting could not even find the venue. Abiola made a brief appearance at the meeting, assuring those present of renewed commitment to democracy. Abiola had said that he was happy that he was not sworn in as president on August 26 last year. His reason was the he &quot;would have run the worst government Nigeria ever had&quot; because most of the people he wanted to appoint ministers &quot;had a separate personal agenda.&quot; He lamented that those who advised him to write to former President Ibrahim Babangida were those who leaked the letter to the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added: &quot;They were only waiting for me to appoint them and they would have come with their own plans which would have torpedoed my government.&quot; &quot;Newswatch&quot; also learnt that most of the people who attended the meeting from the Middle Belt claimed they did so on observer basis. Said one of them: &quot;Our instruction was to attend the meeting, go back home and discuss the issues raised before a joint communique has been issued, what shall we tell them when we return? Supposing most of them are not keen on boycotting the election as enunciated in this communique?&quot; Some leaders of the South-West listed as having participated in drafting the communique claimed that they were not at the meeting. While Akinyemi said he attended only one of the meetings of NADECO but supported the boycott of the election, Balogun said he could not append his signature to a document he did not help draft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A member of NADECO who participated in drafting the communique, however, dispelled rumours of any division in their rank. He accepted the stand of the Middle Belt group that further discussions at the regional levels would have been welcome. &quot;We were, however, mindful of the time factor. If you allow too much time to pass, many people will change their positions, so we had to act fast,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the government, the on-going crisis is not a total surprise. In South Africa, Abacha himself had said he was embarrassed by the cold reception he received from world leaders. &quot;He felt lonely and sad,&quot; said a government official who was also in South Africa. &quot;He was only consoled by his public relations men who promised to present him to the international community as &quot;a sincere leader whose intentions have been grossly misunderstood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first suggestion was for the head of state to grant interview to international magazines and journals. This was abandoned when the head of state showed very little enthusiasm for it. It was then decided that he should react to international issues through paid advertisements. Last week, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published a statement by Abacha congratulating Mandela for his electoral victory. Targetted at the American audience, the one-page statement advocated &quot;peaceful change&quot; in South Africa. To assuage the feelings of many world leaders who reportedly told him during his South African trip to embrace democracy, Abacha also spoke of the need for &quot;the rest of us in Africa&quot; to &quot;move speedily to enthrone freedom and home-grown democracy.&quot; Although he did not elaborate on what his home-grown democracy means, the head of state said: &quot;This process is taking root in Nigeria with the Constitutional Conference which will define our march to full democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement, which cost Nigerian tax payers more than N1 million, came during what an Aso Rock source described as &quot;Abacha's season of anomy.&quot; In the economic and political sectors, nothing appears to be working.  Government officials were even working at cross-purposes. Take Don Etiebet, the minister of petroleum resources. He had addressed the press and hinted of an imminent increase in the price of fuel. But Jerry Gana, the information minister, who sat with Etiebet during his encounter with the press, quickly denied the story, saying there was no plan to increase the price of petroleum products. Another statement was issued by Diya's office denying any imminent fuel price increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For politicians, the call for a boycott of the elections was an anti-climax. Unsure of whether Abiola would stand up to the calls for him to form a cabinet or not, the politicians who had formed various political groups had made elaborate arrangements for the election. In the South-West zone, for instance, the election would have been a showdown between Afenifere and the New Dimension. Afenifere's position on the constitutional conference and other national issues were hazy until last week when it finally called for the installation of Abiola as president. Ajasin could not talk to &quot;Newswatch&quot; last week because he was observing a bedrest. Ige would not talk except by appointment. Adeleke said he would indeed to get clearance from all the group leaders to be able to talk on it. Initial indications were that although the group was maintaining its stance on the sanctity of June 12 and Abiola's mandate in public, it was ready to settle for a rotational presidency starting with the Yorubas. The group, using the old structures of former Action Group, AG, and Unity Party of Nigeria, UPN, seems to be very popular among the older generation in the states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The New Dimension is the brain-child of people who disagree with the approach and style of the west in former political dispensations. They claim to resent the politics of exclusion and secrecy of the AG and UPN days which they believed did not open up the west to national politics. The group is led by Oladosu Oladipo, former SDP governorship aspirant in Osun State. Other prominent members of the group include Bamidele Olumilua, former governor of Ondo State, and former chairmen of SDP in the western states, Tade Ipadeola, Oyo; Kareem Ajayi, Osun; Kayode Blessing, Ondo; Gbolade Oshimowo, Ogun; and Nuru Baruwa, Lagos. It has also been enlarged to include some notable former NRC stalwarts like Yekini Adeojo, Femi Coker, and Ayo Ogunlade, all former NRC governorship candidates in the 1992 governorship elections in Oyo, Ogun, and Ondo states. Other notable members are: Sunday Afolabi, former deputy governor of Oyo State, Adisa Akinloye, former NPN national chairman who is the &quot;father&quot; of the group, Yomi Akintola, son of late premier of the Western Region, S.L. Akintola, and the Wole Awolowo, son of Obafemi Awolowo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group's major achievement is the reconciliation of both the Akintola and Awolowo families, whose fathers fell apart during the AG crisis in 1962. The presence of former NPN and NRC chieftains makes it difficult to attach any ideological leanings to the group. Oladipo, however, insists it is made up of progressives since the core founders were former SDP members.  &quot;That there are members of former NPN and NRC among us shows that we have converted those people into the progressive fold,&quot; he told &quot;Newswatch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presence of Oladipo. Afolabi, Haruna Elewi and others who worked for Yar'Adua during the 1992 presidential election primaries has earned the group the tag Yar'Adua boys.&quot; They are said to be consolidating their political hold on the south-west so that the group can win th presidency for a Yar'Adua man. But Oladipo denies this allegation. Of course, any election in the south-west zone now will be a test of strength between Afenifere and the New Dimension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation in Oyo State is very interesting. The struggle is between Lamidi Adedibu and members of both Afenifere and New Dimension. In the state, leaders of the two groups like Kolapo Ishola, Afenifere, Rasheed Ladoja, a former senator, Afenifere, Yekini Adeojo, New Dimension, Olunloye, New Dimension, and others are challenging the political leadership of Adedibu in Ibadan politics. Acting under the umbrella of Ibadan/Ibarapa Movement, they have denounced Adedibu as their leader. The group is led by Balogun who incidentally does not belong to either Afenifere or New Dimension. Balogun told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that the group is to create a common leadership front that will have a kind of control on the state's indigenes no matter their political leanings. He said the group wants to ensure that credible people come out to contest elections rather than the usual handpicking of candidates for elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the constitutional conference, the Ibadan/Ibarapa Movement had lined up its candidates. For the two seats given to Ibadan, they picked Ladoja and Adeojo. The group has been campaigning for these candidates against those nominated by Adedibu. The boycott order may have now thrown a spanner in the works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the eastern states, it was not clear at press time if the boycott order would be effective. Eastern leaders did not speak with one voice on the boycott. Lulu Briggs, former deputy chairman of the NPN, has a few words for advocates of a boycott of the conference. Says he: &quot;People should send forth their first eleven because anything could happen at the conference. Decisions will be taken and they will be imposed on even those who were not keen on the conference.&quot; Okon Amana, a spokesman for the Akwa Ibom Forum on National Issues, AKFON, also advised people to embrace the conference so that vital issues of national integration could be tackled. Only the Ijaw, the Annang and the Ogoni had said they were boycotting the elections. Eric Aso, a former governorship aspirant in Rivers State, is against the conference &quot;because the basis of representation marginalises the people of Rivers State. So what are we going there to say?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference itself, for the minority groups of the east, presents an opportunity to seek justice and fair play. According to political leaders from the area, the annulment of the June 12 election raised fundamental questions about the role of each ethnic group in Nigeria. An unanswered question, according to Asikpo Essien-Ibok, a political scientist and a member of the SDP, is: &quot;If the big one cannot get its way, what future is there for the smaller ones?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This thinking, he said, has resulted in the formation of various political associations in the minority states. At the respective mini-national conferences which took place a month ago, each southern minority state called for the sovereignty of each nationality. Said Essien-Ibok: &quot;Of all the many associations that emerged in the minority states, the most potent that has clarity of purpose and intellectual vision of the new Nigeria is the Movement of National Redemption, MNR. Its membership cuts across all nationalities of every state. Its philosophy is universal and its ideology is the ideology of redemption from oppression, exploitation, corruption and mismanagement. Since it is national in scope, it assures a new form of progressive movement.&quot; The MNR is led by Enahoro, a former federal commissioner for information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are also the Oron Study Group and the Akwa Ibom State Centre for New Nigeria, AKSCNN. The two groups have made their positions known in their separate papers to the National Constitutional Conference Committee. Before submitting its memorandum, the Oron Study Group, comprising only the four local governments of former Oron Local Government, mandated O.O. Bassey, a professor and surgeon and his group, to work out a position for the people of Oron. Of course, the Oron people seem to favour federalism and are opposed to creating new zones as federal units. It favours a readjustment of boundaries of existing states based on rational criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the AKSCNN also wants the sovereignty of Nigeria discussed freely at the national conference. It insists that such debate must be based on the principle of equality of various nationalities or ethnic groups in Nigeria.  AKSCNN favours an arrangement whereby the southern minorities are allowed to exercise sovereign rights over their people, culture, tradition and mineral resources which fall within their territory. In other words, AKSCNN wants a loose federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People, MOSOP, seems to share the feelings of the AKSCNN although it goes a step further to demand independence for the minorities. Ken Saro-Wiwa, president of MOSOP, is very resolute in his pursuit of this goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beyond the groupings of various nationalities, there is also a resurgence of former political associations. The Eastern Mandate Union, for instance, is a grouping of the defunct Peoples Front of Nigeria, PFN. Its members in the east and southern zone are proteges of Yar'Adua. They include Dele-Cole, Chuba Okadigbo, a senator, and Arthur Nwankwo, among others. At the moment, it is more academic than real. As Essien-Ibok puts it: &quot;As far as the politics of the east is concerned, the main attraction will be the volume of resources pumped into it rather than the idea or the personality involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Unity Club is supposed to be a rebirth of the non-registered Peoples Solidarity Party, PSP. The name was coined and stamped in Owerri by a member of the group described by his colleagues as &quot;young and over-ambitious.&quot; It exists more in Imo State and on the pages of newspapers than anywhere else in the east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Eastern Forum is derived from Eastern Solidarity founded by the late R.B.K. Okafor and Essien-Ibok. It later matured into Oriental Club. The club was later reorganised by Steven Shekari, retired air vice-marshal and national caretaker chairman of the SDP. The Forum was a serious political proposition with a major defect. There was no centre of gravity; no material basis for unity; no new theoretical constructs to invoke a sense of belonging. Unlike Kaduna and Ibadan which were and still are the political centres for the former north and west respectively, Enugu is not the political centre for the former east, not even for the four Igbo states carved out of former East Central State, Enugu is now for Enugu State. Enugu does not prescribe and protect the interest of Akwa Ibom, Rivers and Cross River states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Politically, there is a yawning gap between the east and southern zone comprising Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Rivers states. The gap is based on distrust, and a defeated Domino theory. For instance, in May 1987, Tanko Yakasai, Okafor, Tunji Otegbeye, Essien-Ibok, Balarabe Musa, Ibrahim Gusau, Guy Ikoku, Lateef Jakande met in Okafor's residence for the first time after the demise of the Second Republic to formulate ideas which could lead to the re-awakening of the Progressive Movement. Those ideas led to the formation of the PSP. Claude Ake, a professor of political economy and Essien-Ibok, were the main ideologues of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When it came to power sharing, the post of national secretary of the party was zoned to the east. The eastern minorities sought the cooperation and support of the Igbos for the office. They received none. Rather, the Igbos grabbed it and advised the eastern minorities to wait for another opportunity. That position went to Ezekiel Izuogu. When the PSP transformed into the SDP, the post was once again zoned to the east. It was now the opportunity of the CAR states to produce one. Again, the eastern minorities were outmaneuvered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Times are also changing in the Middle Belt states of Benue, Kogi, Kwara, Plateau, Niger and Taraba. Until three weeks ago, only the Middle Belt Forum, an amalgam of various progressive elements in the area, was in existence. Its origin stretched to 1992 when it sought to present a presidential candidate from the area. Adebayo, Madaki, Jang, Suleiman, Adasu and Achema are some of the forum's prominent members. Their obsession and common linkage is their distaste for domination by the Hausa-Fulani group. In the past four weeks, the group's target shifted to only Yar'Adua. With the backing of Danjuma, members of the group have vowed to whittle down Yar'Adua's political influence in the Middle Belt area. Unable to change the course of events within the MBF, some Yar'Adua faithfuls in the Middle Belt thought of a bright idea - split the MBF. This has now led to the formation of the Middle Belt Congress, MBC, led by Unongo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether politicians in the Middle Belt will boycott this week's election will depend on personal decisions of contestants. So far, the Middle Belt as a group has not come up with any joint decision on the conference.  Although Achema and a few other members of the MBF attended NADECO's meetings, their mission was not to commit the group to any communique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, the far northern states have been silent on all the political maneuvers going on in Nigeria. No prominent politician from the northern states has said he is boycotting the national constitutional conference. The little effort made towards the constitutional conference was by Umaru Shinkafi, former presidential aspirant of the NRC, and Bashir Tofa, presidential candidate of the NRC in the annulled June 12, 1993, presidential election. Jointly, they had organised a conference: &quot;Nigeria for Our Generation.&quot; The group also tried to woo southern politicians like Sam Mbakwe, former governor of Imo State, Akinloye, president of Nigeria, and Ola Vincent, former governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yar'Adua appears to be the only star around which political events in the northern states, as in most other states, revolve. He is still maintaining all his old political structures and is said to be working ahead of the constitutional conference. &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt that Yar'Adua has also established strong links with notable northern politicians like Adamu Ciroma, minister of agriculture, Bamanga Tukur, minister for industries, Tofa, Shinkafi and Lawal Keita. The aim, according to a source, is to ensure his return to the northern fold. In the last experiment with democracy, Yar'Adua's support base was strong in the south-west than it was in the northern state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if NADECO's wishes are upheld, these political maneuvers may all come to naught. The question, however, is whether Abacha and his men would go ahead with the elections. Olisa Agbakoba, president of the Civil Liberties Organisation, CLO, told &quot;Newswatch&quot; last week that although his organisation was not consulted on the boycott order, it will be effective with &quot;A mass-based organisation.&quot; He said there had been a lot of noise-making on the issue of June 12, adding: &quot;The time has come for a pro-democracy movement that can deliver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indications at press time were that government may postpone this week's election. As one government source said: &quot;How can we go ahead with this election when many people are boycotting it? The lessons of the 1964 boycott of election are clear enough. Going ahead with it would be a disaster for the government.&quot; Indeed the Abacha government seems to be riding a tiger's back.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Special Assistant to the Executive Director of UNICEF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Tostan&quot; means &quot;the hatching of an egg&quot; in Wolof, one of the languages of my country, Senegal. &quot;Tostan&quot; has been used to name a successful literacy project in Senegal, as it carries the idea of &quot;breakthrough,&quot; that moment of discovery when a chick cracks open the eggshell or when a human being makes the connection between letters and ideas. Africa is waiting for an even bigger breakthrough, when the world discovers that Africa is not, as commonly considered, a continent of despair, but a continent where a better future is within reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The challenge has never been greater External debts of crippling proportions, falling commodity earnings, war, drought, high population growth, environmental degradation, and an epidemic of AIDS have reversed the advances made in Africa in the 1960s and 1970s. Governments try to ensure that the basic needs of their populations are met, but in times of trouble the first cutbacks are usually in health and education sectors. The victims?  Those whose need for support is the greatest -- children.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa has only 10 percent of the world's child population, but one third of the almost 13 million children who die every year are Africa. Over 30 million children in African are suffering from malnutrition. At least one African in three of primary school age is not in school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet two facts stand out that give cause for hope and optimism. We have the capability to succeed in creating a better life for all our children, as well as the conditions favorable to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Success is possible because we have the tools to counter disease, malnutrition, and illiteracy. Effective, sustainable, and low-cost interventions will improve the health and lives of the disadvantaged. The cost of providing clean water in Africa has been halved since the mid-1980s and now averages about $20 per person per year. Trials in all regions of the world, including Africa, have demonstrated that the incidence of child malnutrition can be halved for less than $10 per child per year. Basic education can be provided at a cost of approximately $20 per child per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many factors are helping to push the needs of children to the top of agendas for action and attention. The movement towards democracy is gaining ground. The breakthrough of past political ideologies has left a vacuum that can be filled by humanitarian guiding principles. Already, African governments have surpassed other regions in their commitment to the protection of child rights through their ratification of the &quot;Convention on the Rights of the Child&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have been concrete successes, but many were not considered &quot;newsworthy,&quot; despite the often extraordinary efforts made to achieve them.  By 1990 two thirds of African countries achieved the goal of immunizing 75 percent of their children against the six major diseases of tuberculoses, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, and polio. The challenges were many, including overcoming the logistics of keeping vaccines chilled between modern medical centers and remote, traditional communities. (Methods including strapping iceboxes on to the back of bicycles; traditional four-legged modes of transportation were also used.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the Bamako Initiative, launched in 1987 in the capital of Mali, communities in rural, underserved areas have worked in collaboration with their national ministries of health to establish affordable and sustainable basic health services that, to the extent possible, are locally financed and managed. The value of community-based health care is better understood when one learns that in sub-Saharan Africa, there is an average of one doctor for every 24,500 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wars have been halted for African children. In the Sudan in 1989, after bloody strife and associated famine had claimed the lives of some 250,000 civilians, mostly children and women, warring parties granted safe passage for the delivery of food and assistance to more than 2 million people. This practice of &quot;corridors of peace&quot; acknowledges that the future of a nation ultimately depends on the survival and healthy development of its children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concrete expressions of support and commitment to improving the well-being of African children have been made at international gatherings with players at the highest levels. In November 1992, a major conference held in Dakar, Senegal, united heads of state, government ministers, local government leaders, and non-governmental organizations from Africa, developing, and industrialized nations to focus on issues concerning African children. Convened by the Organization of African Unity with assistance from UNICEF, the countries of Africa represented at the International Conference on Assistance to African Children pledged to attain a set of intermediate targets by the end of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This commitment shows to what extent African social leaders, experts, and humanitarians believe in the ability of Africa to reverse the recent trend of decline. For they pledged to further raise immunization coverage levels, increase use of oral rehydration therapy to combat dehydration caused by diarrhea, virtually eliminate iodine and vitamin A deficiency disorders, and encourage breastfeeding, all by 1995. This represents tremendous mobilization in a relatively short period of time -- three years -- that could spell generations of life at higher levels of health and well-being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The importance of international support and commitment was underlined at the Dakar Conference. In 1990, world leaders at the World Summit for Children adopted goals ensuring the survival, protection, and development of children by the year 2000. The cost of achieving those goals in Africa, including the intermediate targets adopted at the Dakar Conference, is estimated to total US$12.7 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This may seem like a lot. Yet it is actually less than what Africa already receives in the form of official development assistance (ODA) -- the continent annually receives US$18 billion. However, only US$2 billion of ODA currently goes towards meeting priority human needs. A reorientation of social values and priorities is clearly necessary. Actions taken to reach the intermediate targets would save the lives of some 3,000 children every day -- 1 million a year -- and significantly reduce malnutrition and disabilities as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recent events have shown that care does not need to be confined within national borders. The children of Somalia are the concern of the global community, in spite of economic recessions and plunging profits. In addition, the growing interdependence among nations not only brings social responsibility for one another, but also an increase in cultural wealth and understanding. This is why I urge all Americans, especially Africa-Americans, to join in the 1993 Commemoration of the Day of the African Child on June 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The June 16 date was selected because it was on that date in 1976 that school-children were massacred in Soweto, South Africa. The Day of the African Child can have many meanings. For some, it will be a cause for celebration, an opportunity to report progress on promises that were made to Africa's children. For others, it will be a time for reflection on hardships experienced by the youngest and most vulnerable citizens of the continent.  This year, many African nations will focus on reaching the intermediate targets and the World Summit goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commemoration of the Day can help generate the breakthrough that Africa is waiting for, when the world community cracks the wall of misperception and discovers a continent where a better life for children is within reach and there is a strong will to attain it. Children receive only one chance to grow normally in mind and body. That chance should be protected, in good ties as well as in bad. It must be a priority for all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Brian Atwood, the U.S. government's coordinator for international disaster assistance, went to the White House last month to report on his upcoming visit to this famine-plagued quadrant in Africa, his mission was &quot;enthusiastically endorsed&quot; by the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We talked about the importance of crisis prevention as the foundation of his foreign policy,&quot; Atwood said enroute to deliver the message that East Africa could be facing yet another massive humanitarian disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trip, which the White House designated a &quot;presidential mission&quot; to give it greater visibility, is the first of a planned new series of initiatives to make Africa a higher foreign policy priority. Africa policy has lacked identity of shape, senior officials concede. But they say there is a new determination to avoid costly Somalia and Rwanda-type fiascoes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To highlight the new policy direction, the White House will has a day-long conference on Africa at the end of the month with participation by members of Congress, academic experts and the leaders of key private organizations. The president and vice president will speak and take part in what officials are calling an &quot;extraordinary&quot; event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Planning is underway for a state visit in the fall by South African President Nelson Mandela, and President Clinton is planning a trip early next year to South Africa and several other newly democratic African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president also has appointed a special envoy for Sudan, Melissa Wells, a senior career diplomat with extensive African experience, who will arrive in the region next week to bolster current efforts by East African governments to end that seemingly intractable civil war. Already, another special envoy, Paul Hare, is working alongside a United Nationals negotiator on Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Atwood, who visited three African countries and three European capitals last week, is accompanied by Rep. Tony Hall (D-OH), the prominent Congressional anti-hunger campaigner, and the heads of three major private relief organizations -- CARE, Catholic Relief Services, and the International Rescue Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 20 million people face starvation if the annual rains don't arrive in the 10-nation region extending from Sudan and Somalia southward through Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania, according to a detailed U.S. government analysis compiled from satellite photos and other data. Weather patterns so far this year suggest a repeat of the devastating droughts that hit the area in 1984-85 and 1972-73. The suffering this time could be on a far larger scale because of a rapid population increase and the devastation of war throughout the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we don't have a bad drought this year, we will next year or the year after,&quot; said Fred Fischer, director of AID's regional office in Nairobi, told the Atwood delegation in a briefing here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With United States currently providing 60% of the food aid in the region, both Atwood and Hall asked during the European stopovers for other donors to take a larger share if additional food is needed this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the group's visit to Eritrea, which became independent from Ethiopia a year ago, President Isayas Afewerki criticized what he said was an imbalance in U.S. foreign aid that he said discourages self-sufficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eritrea this year is receiving about $24 million in emergency food from the United States, but only $6.9 million in development assistance. More long-term development funding is required, he said, to enable countries like Eritrea to escape dependency on outside help. Eritrea has drawn up a detailed economic redevelopment plan, but disappointingly little of the assistance needed to implement it has been pledged, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Eritreans are trying to jump-start their economy with projects designed to give two major population groups that now live on hand-outs the means for self support. In the town of Tessenai, in western Eritrea, the delegation visited a refugee reception center, which is nearly ready to begin processing the fist of some 500,000 Eritreans living in camps a few miles across the border in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With health and nutrition deteriorating in the camps and Sudan's military regime aggressively pedaling fundamentalist Islam to the refugees, the Eritrean government decided not to delay their repatriation effort while awaiting outside help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the nearby Ali Gidir agricultural project, Atwood's group saw what this month will become home to several thousand former guerrilla soldiers who are begin demobilized as Eritrea reduces its army to 35,000, about a third of the size when the 30-year independence war ended in 1991. Modern farm machines are parked on three large plots marked off for planting by the first group of 2500 ex-fighters scheduled to arrive next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With over 60 percent of its 2.6 million people currently dependent on food aid and the country already suffering from prolonged drought, the government has not wanted to set up new camps inside its borders where money spent on their upkeep would drain funds from economic development. Instead, the authorities turned to the Central Bank for financing when sufficient donor assistance could not be found so that refugees can begin returning home and on arrival receive the tools and seeds needed to immediately start growing their food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've got to get this region beyond the disaster level and onto the path of economic growth,&quot; said Atwood, who heads the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). &quot;Scarcity clearly produces conflict,&quot; he said. &quot;That was a big problem in Rwanda -- population growth that outdistanced food output.&quot; The Clinton administration when it took office promised to do more to help Africa. But the continent has not received the kind of high-level attention policymakers say they had intended. Atwood says that is changing. The administration is &quot;very pro-active with respect to Africa,&quot; Atwood said, citing th recently announced $600 million aid package for South Africa and the White House conference. Beginning with a dinner on June 26 addressed by Anthony Lake, the president's national security advisor, the conference will continue throughout the next day with top officials outlining administration policy and participants taking part in discussion groups. Clinton will speak at lunch on June 27.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African Development Foundation (ADF) is a public enterprise set up in 1980 by the US Congress to support self-development initiatives by African populations. The major goal is to provide the resources needed by African grassroots populations to reach self-reliant development. ADF does not impose external development concepts on African communities. Instead, it encourages Africans to suggest innovative approaches to problem-solving, which will eventually lead to self-reliance and self-sufficiency in the local communities. Researchers are requested to explore problems directly related to grassroots development and to make concrete recommendations that can be of assistance to development project promoters in the community. ADF provides grants for research initiated and conducted by African academics, development specialists, students and community groups. Researchers are encouraged to be creative in selecting their theme and to focus their research on issues which are crucial to the development of their countries. In 1994, ADF will allocate approximately US $675,000 to research project funding. Four types of fellowships will be awarded: Gray postgraduate fellowships (deadline August 1, 1994); Be applied research fellowships (deadline August 1, 1994); Grants for transfer of knowledge (no deadline); Leland development fellowships (deadline January 1, 1995).

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOUTHEASTER NEWSPAPER, June 10-14, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recent Goniwe verdict presents the new Government of National Unity with an early challenge on dealing with the evils of our past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By finding unequivocally that Matthew Goniwe and his three colleagues were murdered by security forces in 1985, and that Major-General Joffel van der Westhuizen's signal to the State Security Council was indeed a request for permission to assassinate, Judge-President Mr. Justice Neville Zietsman has opened the way not only; for the full truth about this grisly hit-squad operation to be revealed, but, together with it, much about the military-security underworld and its Third Force operatives that have ravaged our society for so long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pressures will be great not to rock the boat at this moment when the focus of the new government is to bring about national reconciliation, especially not to alarm and estrange the security forces just when they are being brought on side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But disclosing the truth is an essential part of reconciliation. As President Mandela said in his first state-of-the-nation address to parliament last week, the past may be forgiven but cannot be swept under the carpet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All the great religions teach there must be confession and atonement before there can be absolution and reconciliation. It is a truth as fundamental to human psychology as it is to theology from Ireland to Bosnia, the lesson of history is that unrequited grievances poison the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There does not have to be retribution. As Nyameka Goniwe says, all she needs is to know who and why. She does not required revenge in order to be requited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What should happen now is clear. On the basis of the judge's findings, there is a prima facie case of incitement to murder against Van der Westhuizen, both in regard to the death of Goniwe and his colleagues and in regard to a plot to assassinate Lennox Sebe, the former president of the former Ciskei bantustan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would appear that Van der Westhuizen could also be charged with perjury, since on the basis of the judge's findings he must have lied under oath in his evidence to the inquest court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Major-General Johannes van Rensburg, who received the death signal from Van der Westhuizen after discussing the matter with him on the telephone, would also appear to be vulnerable to charges of incitement to murder and perjury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Attorney-General of the Eastern Cape division of the Supreme Court should press these charges without delay. This would confront both men with the choice of either facing trial, or of seeking indemnity under a new amnesty law now being drafted which will almost certainly require applicants to give details of the acts for which they wish to be indemnified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Either way, we would then stand to learn more about what happened and who else may have been involved. For example, Van der Westhuizen refused to answer questions at the inquest about Operation Katzen -- a plot named after himself and the former Chief of the Defence Force General Kat Liebenberg, to assassinate Lennox Sebe and install his brother, Charles Sebe, as head of a new party modelled on Inkatha to rule an amalgamated Transkei-Ciskei bantustan -- on the grounds that he might incriminate himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If he were to stand trial on a charge related to that operation, Van der Westhuizen would have to answer those questions. We might then get some disclosure of the extent of the military-security underworld's activities in the Border-Kei region, for years a prime target area for the forces of repression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is even more important is that there is now a powerful onus on the military and police to clear their names by identifying the murderers in their midst. They cannot be respected and effective arms of the new South Africa if they continue to cover for guilty members in their ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police especially have an obligation to bring the Goniwe investigation to a satisfactory conclusion -- and it is up to the new Minster of Safety and Security, Sidney Mufamadi, to ensure this is done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police have to find what lawyers call the missing &quot;nexus&quot; in this case -- the missing link that prevented Mr. Justice Zietsman from making a definitive finding in the inquest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is known, according to the verdict, that Van der Westhuizen, then a brigadier in charge of Eastern Cape Command, sent a signal message to Van Rensburg, then secretary to the State Security Council, requesting permission for Goniwe to be murdered. It is also known that he was indeed murdered by the security forces. But what cannot be proved on the evidence now available is whether the killing was a direct result of the message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is the missing link. If it is found, the charge against one or more people will be murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other words, the police have to establish what happened to the message after Van Rensburg received it. Who did it go to? Did someone authorize the murder? If so, who? And who carried out the order that must have been given?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is ascertainable information. There must be people who were in powerful positions in and around the State Security Council at the time who know what happened. They, too, now face a choice -- either run the risk of successful police detection which could lead to them being charged with complicity in the murder, or seek indemnity and disclose what they did and what they know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus can the truth come out at last. And as these chips in the granite wall of secrecy are prized out, an avalanche of disclosure will follow -- until at last not only Nyameka Goniwe, but the whole South Africa will know who and why, from Steve Biko to the Third Force, and our society will be cleansed of its ugly past.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND, May 26, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Knox Report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was not much cause for celebrating the 30th anniversary of African Development Bank at the Bank's annual meeting in Nairobi in May 1994.  The majority of Africans are poorer now than they were thirty years ago with famine and civil strife a reality in many countries. In addition, the continent's premier development institution had received a devastating report card, which for several months had been kept under strict secrecy but could no longer remain confidential at the Nairobi meeting. Analogous to the Wapenhans report at the World Bank, the African Development Bank underwent a review of its portfolio which is known as the Knox report. The central conclusion of the Knox report is that the Bank may end up destroying itself unless it is strengthened through fundamental reforms in its governance and management.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Knox report states that it was unable to assess the Bank portfolio's contribution to development in Africa, because the Bank does not have &quot;reliable and sufficient data on completed and active projects&quot; (p.4).  The Knox report found that there is no systematic monitoring, supervision and reporting of Bank projects. Neither does the Bank know how its staff time is being used nor had it established a relationship between its planning and budget. Other findings were that the Bank's own rules and procedures are often ignored and that the Bank suffers from a general absence of responsibility. All the emphasis is placed on the volume of money lent with little consideration for the development impact: &quot;At presents, too much attention is paid to the quantity of lending and tool little, perhaps even none, to its quality&quot; (p. iv).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the same Bank executives and managers, who have presided over the chaos at the Bank in the past, will now be in charge of introducing fundamental reforms. This will doubtlessly be challenging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the years the Bank has lent billions of dollars for development project yet it has paid little or no attention to the impact of these projects on people and the environment. African non-governmental organizations have gathered increasing evidence that projects by the Bank often aggravate the already precarious situation of poor populations living in the project areas and contribute to environmental degradation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bank must be restructured to ensure that the impact of its policies and projects on people and the environment become its top consideration in future lending decisions. Responsibilities as well as an internal system of incentives must be clearly spelled out to ensure adherence to the new priorities. Any &quot;strengthening&quot; of the Bank short of this goal will be short-term and ineffective. Member countries are still deliberating replenishment of the African Development Fund and should consider phasing their three-year contribution to make it contingent upon the efficacy of the reform efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What Concept of Environment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until now the African Development Bank Group has largely dealt with the environment as a public relations issue to &quot;please the non-regional member countries.&quot; The prevailing attitude continues to be that concern about the environment is a luxury that may be appropriate for the rich developed countries, but that African countries can ill-afford. Western conservation organizations active in Africa, with their traditional focus on the protection of wildlife and lack of attention to the needs of local people, may have helped shape this attitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But environment is first and foremost clean water, air and healthy soils, which are the basis for all economic activity and on which human well-being and survival ultimately depends. In Africa, concern about the environment is directly related to the continent's ability to produce food.  Protection of the environment is essential to good production especially on a continent where millions of people are threatened by malnutrition, if not famine and starvation. The production of staple foods for local consumption and, where possible, of tradable surpluses is the most effective means of alleviating poverty. There is a clear chain linking a healthy environment with food production and poverty reduction and subsequently with the health of women and children as well as population growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The livelihoods of a vast majority of Africans depend directly on the productivity of the land, forests and oceans, rivers and lakes. Soil erosion, degraded forests and polluted waters, which often result form misguided development efforts, mean stunted growth for children and a life of ill health and ultimately the tightening of the vicious cycle between environmental degradation and increasing poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Know report states that Africa needs a Bank that is &quot;fired with imagination, ideas and flexible and innovative approaches to development.&quot; A fundamental reorientation of the current development model is needed toward addressing the priorities of local people and protecting the natural resource base that sustains their livelihoods. Increased social well-being and political stability will be the likely spin-offs of such a reorientation. So will global benefits such as a more humane world to bequeath to future generations and much improved chances for the protection of the earth's biodiversity and atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concrete Steps to Strengthening the Bank's Environment and Social Policy Division</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Access to information on Bank projects and the opportunity for participation of affected people and NGOs in projects from the early project design stages to it implementation and evaluation continue to be unfulfilled promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bank has now committed itself to develop an information policy and a model for an independent appeals mechanism, analogous to the one created at the World Bank. NGOs hope to have the opportunity to provide input in both these important initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the meantime, the Bank's Environment and Social Policy Division clearly needs to be elevated within the Bank and be considerably strengthened before -- at a very minimum -- it ca help ensure that Bank policies and operations do not contribute to the impoverishment of Africa's people and environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Division is woefully understaffed and lacks resources. Despite the competence and dedication of the ca. ten staff members of the division, they have neither the access nor the resources to carry out the tasks at hand: Overseeing policies, programs and operations relating to all social, environmental and public health issues of the Bank's entire portfolio. At present, a considerable amount of staff time has to be used to raise funds from bilateral donors for environmental impact assessments that are mandatory under the Bank's policy. In addition the staff is to categorize all project proposals, monitor and supervise the ca. 180 projects in the lending program, as well as raise the funds and identify the consultants for the Bank's policy work. This is clearly an untenable situation and some immediate steps should be taken:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Elevate the Bank's Environment and Social Policy Division to be put directly under the Bank's Vice President for Central Operations. This would confer to the Environment and Social Policy Division at a minimum the same status currently enjoyed by the Bank's Private Sector Development Unit;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Provide the Division with the resources and expertise it needs. At present the environmental work of the Division has no social scientists, biologists, expertise in water resources management (since departure of Norwegian technical assistant) and hazardous and toxic waste, etc.;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Integrate the Bank's NGO unit, which is currently marginalized within the Bank, into the Environment and Social Policy Division to help ensure access to and dissemination of information on Bank projects;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Provide free-standing funds for the Bank's policy and program work and make EIA expenses an integral part of project preparation costs. At present most of the bilateral aid which finances EIAs is &quot;tied aid,&quot; which means that all or much of the financing has to be used for consultants from the country providing the funds;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Ensure participation of in-country national expertise in all EIA work to help support national capacity-building and in-country monitoring of project related activities. So far EIA missions consist frequently entirely of foreign consultant on short-term assignments;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Report on consultation with affected groups. At the previous replenishment negotiations the Bank committed itself to ongoing consultations with affected people and NGOs throughout the EIA process. Management was to report to the Board that meaningful consultations had taken place and would describe these. There seems to have been little -- if any -- action on the commitment. In the future no EIAs should be presented to the Board for approval without detailed description of the consultative processes that have taken place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Ensure Bank &quot;ownership&quot; of the Bank's policies and guidelines. At present these are mostly financed through bilateral aid and produced by consultants from the country providing the &quot;tied aid.&quot; For example, the Bank's recent poverty alleviation paper was funded by Norway, so are the country studies and the Bank's population paper, It is not enough for the Bank to say that poverty alleviation is its top priority. This needs to be reflected in the budgets, including funding for the Bank's basic policies and guidelines to help ensure that they become an integral part of the Bank's culture and operation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Resettlement guidelines. The Bank to date has no policy or guidelines when its projects involved involuntary resettlement. Again bilateral funding has been sought to put these guidelines together and Denmark has committed to provide the funds. Denmark agreed to include African consultants aside from Danish consultants s that will be hired for the job.  While preparations may be too advanced to insist on &quot;untied&quot; aid in this particular case, the Bank now has an excellent opportunity of demonstrating its seriousness about consulting with NGOs. The draft resettlement policy should be widely circulated and African NGOs should be consulted on the draft before it is presented to the Bank's Board for adoption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By Wangari Maathai, June 27, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice President Gore; Distinguished Participants,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wish to record my deep appreciation for the honour and the warm invitation to participate at this meeting and particularly, at this setting.  I believe that it represents a genuine concern for Africa and her peoples and I am sure that many will welcome the hope this initiative represents. They will also follow whatever tangible commitments it will generate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some three decades ago, the political leaders of modern Africa had three major objectives in their minds as they became the first post-colonial African rulers: to decolonize the continent, to promote unity and to effect economic development. With the recent political freedom of Namibia and South Africa that generation of African leaders may consider their first agenda complete. But I think that de-colonizing territories is only the first step.  A more difficult form of is the mental and the cultural decolonization and these two have been ignored to the detriment of the people Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This and the agendas for economic development and unity (national and regional) are the challenges of the new generation of African leaders who are expected to free their people from fear and want and give them dignity. Five hundred years is a long time to struggle against oppression. The task ahead is enormous because the battles of five centuries have left Africans weakened culturally, economically, and politically. But above all it has left us without visionary leaders. The crisis we face in Africa is a crisis of leadership. So how do we go bout facing our current challenges and playing our role?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In trying to answer this question, I draw upon some of my experiences.  I came to this country during the Kennedy Student Lift of 1960 and was among the first Graduate Fellows of the African American Institute. I therefore testify to the importance of education, especially for women. Apart from my academic pursuits at the University of Nairobi, I have worked for the Green Belt Movement of Kenya, a national, indigenous, grassroots and environmental organization, run mostly by women. This organization plants trees. It also informs, educates, empowers women in particular and the society in general.  It addresses issues such as wood energy, soil loss, bio-diversity, food security at family level, poverty, land use capacity, population, and mechanisms of governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Green Belt Movement is a bottom-up approach to development. It has no blue print, preferring to rely on a trial and error method using their expertise, knowledge and the capability of the local people. It addresses both the symptoms and the causes of environmental degradation. It adapts what seems to work and quickly drops what doesn't. It prioritizes on meeting the felt needs of communities: creating jobs, improving the economic status of women, transferring farming techniques and tools, providing wood-fuel for rural populations and the urban poor, fighting malnutrition especially by the planting of fruit trees and indigenous food crops, providing fencing and building materials, protecting forests, water catchment areas and open spaces in urban centers. While addressing these and other environmental issues the Green Belt Movement also identifies and subsequently works on economic and political issues which form important linkages with environmental concerns which are likely to have a negative impact on the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this is not what I was trained to do. This is what the socio-political realities of my country forced me to choose to do. For our work the Green Belt Movement has been threatened, abused and ridiculed. We have continued to work partly because of the support of many friends, some of them right here, who have stood with us in our times of danger. For that we shall be eternally grateful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While doing this environmental work we have identified many bottlenecks which frustrate development efforts and continue to keep the majority of the African people in the back stage of their development and political agenda. Perhaps none of the bottlenecks mentioned below are new, but I believe they have to be addressed if we genuinely want to help Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The concern over these bottlenecks has been raised in other fora. But never at a setting where those with the economic and political power to assist Africa have expressed interest in ideas o how best to go about it.  Like me, many who will learn about this conference will be full of faith and hope because their confidence in the ability and capacity of the United States of America is not misplaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And now to some examples of the bottlenecks:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1.  The absence of peace and security in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peace and security are a prerequisite for development and all human beings aspire and deserve peace and security. They also aspire for happiness and a quality of life devoid of poverty. For the last three decades many African states have hardly enjoyed internal peace and security. Oppression and a prevalent culture of fear and silence gave a semblance of peace which was used to minimize the outcry of citizens in many countries which some sectors of the world portrayed as peaceful, secure and prosperous. But those were the days of the Cold War and misrepresentation was part of the War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cold War though, was hot in Africa. It precipitated some of the most devastating internal wars as African friends and foes of the superpowers fought for economic and political control. It also justified political and economic oppression and violation of human rights in many countries. A trend which did not end with the end of the end of the Cold War. Human and material resources were diverted towards these wars and internal security of states rather than towards human development. The African peoples took a back stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.  Style of Leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other reason why human-centered development was ignored was the style of leadership. During this period dictatorial leaders who were unpopular with their citizens received huge military aid and they built up massive armies, police forces and an equally huge network of secret service whose main preoccupation was, and still is, to spy on their own citizens. In many African states, including the one I know best, Kenya, citizens have become prisoners within their own borders. The preoccupation with internal security and political survival by leaders misdirected scarce resources and sacrificed the agenda for human development for decades. It also encouraged leaders to make changes in national constitutions to give themselves absolute powers and control over all national resources and mechanisms of governance (radio, television, the judicial system, the civil service, the armed forces and periodic elections) originally intended to provide checks and balances and prevent dictatorial tendencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All these mechanisms are heavily controlled, manipulated, misused and censored by Heads of States. So poised, many of the current African leaders enjoy immense power and control and indeed run states as if they were their personal property. They have invented divisive and manipulative tactics such as the on-going politically-motivated tribal clashes in Kenya in order to stay in power. The tribal clashes are also presented as age-old tribal animosities which are coming to the fore because of political liberalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, in countries where the freedom of the press and information is curtailed, where citizens may not assemble, associate or move freely without being harassed by armed policemen, it is difficult to know the honest opinion of ordinary men and women. At least in Kenya, I know for certain that tribes would live together peacefully as they have done for generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The possibility of a more open political system has disquieted President Moi, enough to allow the brewing tribal tensions in Kenya which could easily erupt into the type of violence now ravaging Rwanda. It is important to emphasize that it is not the tribes who want to fight, rather, it is the leaders who are using tribes to arouse ethnic nationalism. The President of Kenya, as was the case with the late President of Rwanda, speaks peace and blames the Opposition for the tribal clashes. One should give him the benefit of the doubt. But, it would be impossible for the Kalenjin community (which is President Moi's community) to train militia, arm them, kill some 2000 of the targeted tribes (in full view of the police force) without the personal sanctioning of the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not to say that ethnicity is non-existent or that Africa will not have to address the problems of identity and nationalism especially with respect to the very unnatural nature of African Nations. But the tribal agenda today has to do less with problems of identity and more with the issue of political and economic control of national resources. Those opting for the old one-party rule want to continue their monopoly of control. Of course we cannot over-rule external forces. A weak, disunited and war-ravaged African is easier to control and exploit. Not to mention that it becomes a big market for small firearms from nations whose economy needs to sell them to make money and save jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dictators will continue to argue that democracy is a western value which cannot work in Africa. But at the same time they deny citizens the right to have constitutional conventions to decide for themselves what type of democracy they want. In Kenya, for example, the Opposition and the religious leaders have been denied the right to meet and discuss the Constitution. Yet the Opposition represents 65% of the electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3.  A frustrated democratization process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The truth is that Africans, like all other human beings want justice, equity, transparency, responsibility and accountability. They want respect and human dignity. They want a decent life and an opportunity to feed, shelter and clothe their families. They are not seeking to dominate or marginalize each other. They want to create a strong civil society which can hold its leaders accountable and responsible, as well as, sustain mechanisms of governance which ensure the security of the people rather than the security of Heads of States and a small group of supporters and opportunists who surround them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is the type of democracy millions of Africans are striving for.  And that is what they would like the leadership in their country to help facilitate morally, economically, and politically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his day, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana is said to have urged Africans to seek first the political freedom and all else would be added unto them. Today Africans are seeking for a more democratic, just and fair form of governance so that all else may be added unto them. As we look at the bottlenecks it would appear that Kwame Nkrumah was right. Only he did not say that it is political freedom which must be grounded on liberty, justice and equity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Incidentally, the recent power sharing in South Africa offers an interesting alternative for Africa. The political culture of &quot;the winner takes all&quot; was forfeited for national unity. The traditional acquisition of absolute power and the control of national resources by &quot;the winner&quot; is one major motivation for dictatorship. Those who &quot;win&quot;, even with a minority vote, inherit the land and all its wealth...literally!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4.  International cooperation for human development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa is being marginalized by the lack of genuine support and cooperation from the rich international community. There is more rhetoric than action. For we know what the problems are. They are discussed in a myriad of words in books, magazines, evaluation reports and development plans, many of which are written by experts. Most foreign aid comes in the form of curative social welfare programmes such as famine relief, food aid, population control programmes, refugee camps, peace-keeping forces and humanitarian mission. Resources should be concentrated in preventive and sustainable human development programmes such as functional education and training, building of infrastructure, in institution and capacity building, in food production, promotion of entrepreneuership, development of cultural and social programmes which empower people so that they can tap their creative energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5.  Corruption in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is suggested that funds which were advanced to Africa for development are stolen and stashed away in secret bank accounts in developed countries. Much secrecy surrounds these financial transactions but it is suggested that if these funds were made available to Africa she would need no more aid. One way to assist Africa and to end &quot;donor fatigue&quot; is to locate these funds and return them to the World Bank and IMF or whoever had advanced them. This would not be a matter of forgiving debts but a case of retrieving stolen capital and returning to the original owner! It is a matter of ethics.  A matter of being just and fair to ordinary Africans on whose behalf the funds were borrowed and from whom the World Bank and IMF is demanding repayment. Many future generations of Africans will be born already deeply in debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So is anybody interested in justice? What is the truth about Africa's international debt? Perhaps when the truth around these financial transaction, which have economically crippled Africa, is finally exposed we shall be as shocked as the world was when we comprehended the atrocities of the Slave Trade or the Holocaust. And we shall again wonder aloud, &quot;How can there be so much cruelty in the hears of men?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For if it is a crime to kill half a million people in Rwanda, it should be a crime to steal millions of dollars, thereby causing the death to millions of innocent people through hunger, malnutrition, lack of adequate health care, and inflationary pries which make it impossible to provide the basic needs. Why is this not a crime?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa is more than its leaders and more than the political and economic interests which influence decision about her. Concern for Africa ought to be concern for the African people and for the future generations of Africans. Those who are cooperating and protecting such stolen wealth should not be protected by global public opinion which wishes to pretend that this is the way Africa does business. Perhaps there should be an international code of moral responsibility to make these cases a threat to peace and security in about the same way ethnic wars threaten peace and security of people in Somalia, Rwanda, Liberia, Kenya, and the former Yugoslavia.  Retrieving these funds and returning them to the creditors would be a great economic humanitarian intervention!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sometimes it appears like these ills are tolerated because they happen in Africa. Would the US have tolerated such financial and economic mismanagement during the re-construction of Europe after the World War II?  Would US have ignored a mismanaged Europe and call it the European burden?  Marginalizing and ignoring Africa in her times of crisis raises these questions because it is contrary to the ideals and the principles which the United States of America is founded upon. Various forces which shape human history and destiny have placed other regions in similar predicaments. The US reaction was not to marginalize or ignore them. They were genuinely assisted with the necessary financial requirements and the technology. And it was not just technology transfer for consumerism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6.  Developing a market which benefits Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite many countries having achieved political independence the economic market is still designed to supply mainly stimulants like coffee, tea, cocoa and luxury delicacies like nuts, beans, tropical fruits and flowers. But again this is a case which can only improve if the governance is improved and the African people assume control of their resources and their economies. International investments are important and an open market is desired but unless once has a government which cares about its people it is difficult to see how any development model designed and carried out by an international community which comes to make profits would generate wealth for the African people. The continent is wealthy but the wealth is mined by and for the benefit of others outside the region. Of course it is her leaders who facilitate this mining of the wealth from the continent to other regions but that does not make it fair and just.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7.  Poverty, poor health and sustained hunger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good health is essential for sustained, creative and productive work and life. Healthy individuals are resourceful and creative and have the urge to fulfill their full potential. If millions of people never have enough to eat, are undernourished and are suffering from parasitic infestations and diseases associated with mal-nutrition and poor sanitation development is bound to stagnate. Poverty, poor health and sustained hunger become a vicious endless circle of misery and want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Notwithstanding statements at international conferences and roundtables of development agencies about agriculture, food security, farming techniques and preventive medicine, the only farming sector which receives adequate attention is that which brings in foreign exchange (coffee, tea, flowers and horticultural crops for export).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Food has of course even become a political weapon with the leaders in power keeping the key to the national granaries, disposing of the food even when their own people need it, and subsequently appealing for food from the international community. The national agricultural policies discourage local farmers and opt for cheap food in the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the available food is produced by women who also carry much of the burden for work done in the rural areas and at family level. But women's work is still rated low, is given low priority, prestige and compensation.  Agriculture and food production in Africa is still a low priority, political statements, again notwithstanding. But again only a government that cares about its people will protect its citizens from the politics of food. And only an informed strong civil society will persuade its government not to sacrifice the local farmers at the altar of international food politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8.  Illiteracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet another obstacle to development is illiteracy. The older generation of Illiterate people tend to overvalue education and the ability to read and write. They over trust those who can and tend to undervalue and underestimate themselves. This disadvantage puts citizens at the mercy of literate members of the community. and the state controlled media! In many countries the national radio and television are the main means of communication and are intended for public education. Unfortunately, many leaders use the national radio and television for political propaganda and personal aggrandizement. Using the radio and television to educate members of the public can only; be effected it here is a democratic and accountable government with effective check s and balances to prevent misuse of political power, privileges and the mass media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9.  Foreign languages form a communication barrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At independence many African States adopted foreign languages as their official languages and all official communication is conducted in those languages. Education is often equated with the ability to speak and write these languages and entry into the job market is virtually impossible without the ability to read and write in them. But only a small number of people speak and write these languages fluently and competently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a continent where illiteracy is very high, communication technology sparse, transport slow and inadequate, use of foreign languages marginalizes a majority of the indigenous populations and greatly reduces their capacity to pay a meaningful role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The inability of a country to communicate effectively with itself ought to be recognized as a major obstacle to development especially at this time of communication revolution. Also the inability to communicate effectively disempowers people, kills their self-confidence and destroys creative energy. It minimizes indigenous knowledge and expertise. We should have the courage to admit that languages so highly valued in the world may not be essential for all the 1/2 billion Africans and may in fact be a bottleneck to their development. The few elites and vestiges of former colonial powers may be excused for believing that development is impossible without these languages. But so did those who believed in Greek, Latin, French, the former language of diplomats and royalty. Insisting on foreign languages for universal functional literacy marginalizes the majority of the people. At the same time, literacy, language and culture are very important in human development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10. Traditional wisdom and culture have been ignored and even destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All human beings have their traditional culture, knowledge, wisdom, and values. These have been accumulated for thousands of years and are older than the Dead Sea Scrolls, many scriptures, masterpieces of literature and music, libraries, and modern media. They have been passed from one generation to another. This accumulated heritage directs communities in times of peace, insecurities, and in times of birth, life and death. It is their antennae into the unknown future and their reference point into their past. While some peoples have invented the art of reading and writing and have been able to record their accumulated knowledge and wisdom, others pass it through oral instructions, stories, ceremonies and customs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People who are robbed of their heritage during occupation, enslavement and political and religious colonization, become disoriented and disempowered. They may lose self-respect and self-confidence as well as the capacity for self guidance, leadership and independent decision-making. Thus beginning a vicious cycle that may be difficult to break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world cannot ignore centuries of cultural adulteration of the African people through religions and mental indoctrination against their heritage. Neither can they minimize the accompanying political and economic domination and exploitation. It is important to recognize the processes through which African people have become disengaged and disempowered. Lest we perpetuate the legacy of blaming the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this must not be an excuse for the perpetual litany of woes about colonialism, slavery, and other injustices against the African people. These gross violations of the rights of the African peoples should be living examples of the many battles which we have fought and won. These are valiant examples where the power of evil was overcome by the power of good. Like the Wailing Wall of Jerusalem these processes should be symbols of the power of the human spirit. They should be a source of pride, inspiration and hope. A people less endowed would have become extinct and forgotten. When this rich heritage is used to disempower the African people it becomes a bottleneck of development when it should be the source of our empowerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed it is empowerment for me!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I draw strength from these past triumphs. They give me reasons to fight modern injustices. They remind me of the victorious road which we have travelled and they give me strength for the journey ahead. I am always aware that I am not alone. For I am in the company of men and women whose moral strength has changed the course of history. You are such men and women. You have the ability and the capacity to change the history of Africa. And the words of Presdient Kenedy ring in my ears. &quot;Why not?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By President Clinton, June 27, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President: Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. Ladies and gentlemen and distinguished guests, thank you so much for participating, and thank you for your understanding of our tardiness here today and for waiting so that I could at least share a few of my thoughts on this subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When I became President, it seemed to me that our country really didn't have a policy toward Africa, that we had policies toward specific countries and very often we tried to do the right thing. We did have a policy toward South Africa that had been the subject of much division and then was the subject of a lot of unity after the election. But it occurred to me that we were really suffering from having paid insufficient attention to the entire continent as well as to various regions and specific countries and specific problems and certain great promise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it became crystallized for me in a way in our involvement in Somalia, which I will always believe was a well-motivated and good thing to do that saved hundreds of thousand of lives, but which was presented, I think quite honestly but wrongly, to the American people as something that could be done on a purely humanitarian enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And as we dealt with that and dealt with the complexities of trying to hand over power to the United Nations mission and the question of how long was long enough; and what the U.N. could do; and what our responsibilities were as a police force, in effect, after the Pakistani comrades in arms were killed there; and dealing with all the various interpretations which could be given to those roles -- it struck me again how we needed good intentions in Africa. We needed attention to Africa. But we also needed to bring the best minds in our country and around the world together to try to learn and to grow and to develop a policy that would make some sense and really had a chance to unleash the human potential of the people of the African continent in ways that would lead to a safer and more prosperous world, a better life for them and a better life for us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wish very much that I had had the chance to just sit here for the last couple of days and listen to all of you. I never learn anything when I'm talking. And I know I need to learn a lot. I was so jealous when the Vice President told me he actually got to come and sit in on one of the seminar sessions and to listen to your wonderful speech, madam (Wangari Maathai), and we thank you for coming. But I assure you that I will follow the results of this conference very closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa matters to the United States. It has to matter to us. And the things we want to do, they sound so good, but we know they're hard to do -- to have sustainable development; to have reasonable population growth; stop the environmental decline; to stop the spread of AIDS; to preempt ethnic tensions before they explode into bloodbaths; to protect human rights; to integrate the spiritual -- the rich and wonderful spiritual heritage of Islam with the demands of modern states and the conflicts that must be reconciled in peaceful ways. These are not just conceptual, these are practical problems, not just for Africans but also for Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For decades we viewed Africa through a Cold War prism and through the fights against apartheid. We often, I think, cared in past years more about how African nations voted in the United Nations than whether their own people had the right to vote. We supported leaders on the basis of the anti-communist or anti-apartheid rhetoric perhaps more than their actions.  And often the United States, because it was a long way away and we had a lot of other problems, just simply ignored the realities of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But now the prism through which we viewed African has been shattered.  In the post-Cold War and post-apartheid world, our guideposts have disappeared and it may be a very good thing if we respond in the proper way.  We have a new freedom and a new responsibility to see Africa -- to see it whole, to see it in specific nations and specific problems and specific promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It seems to me that a lot of what we would like to see occur in Africa is what we would like to have happen everywhere. We'd like to see more prosperity and more well-functioning economies and more democracy and genuine security for people in their own borders. We'd like to see sustainable development that promotes the long-term interest of our common environment on this increasingly shrinking globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa illustrates also a central security challenge of the post-Cold War era -- not so much conflicts across national borders, but conflicts within them which can then spill over. It's not confined to Africa as you see in Europe and the effort we have made to try to contain the conflict in Bosnia even as we worked to resolve it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States is presently supporting seven peacekeeping efforts in Africa. And I have issued new guidelines to help us do this work more effectively. I've already discussed Somalia, but we've had special envoys to the Sudan and Angola. We supported the Organization of African Unity's attempts to find new ways to resolve conflicts there and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The daily reports from Rwanda, of course, remind us of the obstacles we face. There we have provided material, financial and statistical support for the U.N. peacekeeping mission, more than $100 million in humanitarian relief. We've insisted that those who are committing genocide be brought to justice. And we supported the French decision to protect Rwandans at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This action will end as soon as the United Nations is ready to deploy peacekeepers. And we will redouble our efforts to make sure we're providing all the support we can for that and to make sure it happens as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'm not sure that we can fairly view what has happened in Rwanda as an aberration, but simply as the most extreme example of tensions that can destroy generations and disrupt progress and delay democracy. It seems to me that in the face of all of the tensions that are now gripping the continent, we need a new American policy based on the idea that we should help the nations of Africa identify and solve problems before they erupt. Reacting is not enough, we must examine these underlying problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I know one of the underlying problems, and I've been following this on the television, your meeting, is the enormity of outstanding debt. Last year we announced a policy at the G-7 meeting of writing off 50 percent or more of the debt of selected African nations that carry the heaviest debt burdens, and we will continue that. But we are actively searching for new solutions to that problem as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And let me just, among others, challenge all of you here who have to work within the existing federal guidelines -- and I just named our Budget Director the new Chief of Staff, and I don't want to criticize tough budget guidelines, because they help us to get the deficit down -- but one of the difficulties the United States has that a lot of our partners don't have in writing off debt is that debt, even if it is not worth very much, is required under our budget rules to be scored with a certain value. And we have to really work on that because we often find ourselves because of the mechanics of this in a position that can be quite counterproductive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a problem not just in Africa but elsewhere as well. We are actively searching for new solutions to this problem. And I believe that we have to do something about it. Even though we know lightening the debt load won't solve all the problems, we can't solve a lot of the other problems unless we do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The long-term goal has to be sustainable development. And the statistics are pretty grim. Look at what is happening to natural resources, to population, to the gap between rich and poor. Look at what has happened to per capita income in so many countries in the decade of the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africans have a daunting set of challenges before them. And yet we know that they can't do what people are always urging me to do -- just pick out one thing and do it; forget about all the rest. (Laughter.) Right? You hear that before? (Laughter.) The problem is, it gives you something to say you did, but it may not solve the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was very impressed by the writings of Professor Homer Dixon, who argued that all of these fronts must be moved on at once. There is no silver bullet; there is no magic cure. It would be nice if we could just work on one or two issues, but it, unfortunately, it's not possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the representatives from 170 nations meet in Cairo at the population conference in September, they will approve a plan of action that attacks this problem at its heart -- one which will eventually bolster families, improve the social and economic status of women, and provide the kinds of family planning and health services that sustainable development requires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States is a proud partner in embracing this strategy, which will eventually raise living standards and enable us to raise children better throughout the globe. I hope all of you will be supportive of that endeavor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Africans turn away from the failed experiments of the past, they're also embracing new political freedoms. Yes, I know there are too many nations in Africa where tyranny still drowns out opposition in human rights. But as we meet today, more than a dozen Africa nations are preparing for elections.  Opposition voices grow louder. Someday they'll be like me and they'll wish it weren't happening. (Laughter.) But it's a good sign. And the lights of freedom shine brighter. It's all part of it, right? (Laughter.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think South Africa has given a great cause for hope, not only on the African continent, but throughout the world. President Mandela spoke to you, I know, by videotape, and I thank him for that. I thank Reverend Jackson and others who worked so hard to make those elections work well there. And I think the $35 million we spent there last year in trying to prepare for and help make sure the elections came off all right was about the best expenditure of a modest amount of tax dollars that I have seen in many a year. (Laughter.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But now the hard work begins. Governor Cuomo of New York used to have a wonderful phrase that he toted all the time. He says, you know, we campaign in poetry, but alas we must govern in prose. (Laughter.) And Nelson Mandela's long travail in prison, for the rest of us who did not have to suffer personally was an exercise in agonizingly beautiful poetry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But now that those decades of struggle have come to fruition, they must govern in prose, and we must find prosaic, practical, meaningful ways of helping them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have launched a three-year, $600 million trade investment and development program, which is a beginning of that, but not be the end. And we have to do a number of other things as well. I want to ask all of you who are Americans at least when you leave here to help us to develop an American constituency for Africa that creates lasting links between our people and their peoples, and that will help to drive not only the continent ahead but will help to drive a meaningful, sustained agenda here at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We can do this. And maybe the most important thing I can do to work with you in the aftermath of this conference is to do whatever the President can do to develop that constituency, to explain to the American people of whatever race, region or background, why Africa matters to all of us and to our common future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But all members here of the Congress who have participated in this, including many who have tried to have more attention drawn to Africa for years and years and years know that that is the first thing we must do in our democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let me just say one or two other things. I think it's important as we kind of wrap this up to remember that with all the problems and all the terrible things that are happening and all the economic backsliding which has occurred, there is a lot of hope in Africa, even though, for example, there are problems in Sudan, where division delays development; there is Senegal; there is Mali; there is Namibia; there is Botswana. For every Rwanda, there is Benin, Malawi, Eritrea, Ethiopia, where people are trying to draw together as a society. In spite of our continuing frustrations with Angola, we look at Mozambique reaching out for national reconciliation, looking forward to new elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I say this because one of the problems I always find in trying to discuss this with people who are not otherwise engaged is that they read about all these terrible problems and they think, look, we've got all we can say grace over and then some. We're trying to get you to do less, and here you try to get me to think about this. This is a conversation I have now in the White House and around in town here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And I think it is very important, as American s have to choose whether to engage in the future of Africa, that all the things that are happening which are good and positive be known, because we can never develop a constituency for change in this country until people imagine that it will make a difference. And the level of knowledge, frankly, is pretty low, except when something really horrible happens, then it just cuts through our heart and it seems so overwhelming that we can't do anything about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And so that also gives you an excuse to walk away. You get the best of all worlds -- I really care about this, but lamentably there's nothing I can do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And so I say to all of you, I will do what I can. I will never know as much as those of you who have committed your professional lives to the development of Africa; those of you who have friends and family members there; those of you who have ties of passion and history there. But I do know we need a new policy. I do know we need a policy. I do believe Africa matters to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I do know there are a lot of good people there leading and making good things happen. I do know there are a lot of visionaries there. And I do know my child and my grandchildren's future depends upon reconstructing the environmental and social fabric of that continent. I know that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And so I say to you, let's build a constituency. Let's remind people there are things to hope about as well as things to fear. And let's go to work and make this the beginning, just the beginning, of a new American commitment to a better future for all our peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you very much. (Applause.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BY PRESIDENT NELSON MANDELA, Tunis, Tunisia, June 13, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Heads of State and Government, Heads of Delegations, Your Excellencies, Ministers, Ambassadors and High Commissioner, Comrades, Ladies and Gentlemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the distant days of antiquity, a Roman sentenced this African city to death: &quot;Carthage must by destroyed! Carthage delenda est!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Carthage was destroyed. Today we wander among its ruins, only our imagination and historical records enable us to experience its magnificence.  Only our African being makes it possible for us to hear the piteous cries of the victims of the vengeance of the Roman Empire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yet we can say this, that all human civilisation rests on foundations such as the ruins of the African city of Carthage. These architectural remains, like the pyramids of Egypt, the sculptures of the ancient kingdoms of Ghana and Mali and Benin, like the temples of Ethiopia, the Zimbabwe ruins and the rock painting s of the Kgalagadi and Namib deserts, all speak of Africa's contribution to the formation of the condition of civilisation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in the end, Carthage was destroyed. During the long iterregnum, the children of Africa were carted away as slaves. Our lands became the property of other nations, our resources a source of enrichment for other peoples and our kings and queens mere servants of foreign powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the end, we were held out as the outstanding example of the beneficiaries of charity, because we became the permanent victims of famine, of destructive conflicts and of the pestilences of the natural world. On our knees because history, society and nature had defeated us, we could be nothing but beggars. What the Romans had sought with the destruction of Carthage, had been achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the ancient pride of the peoples of our continent asserted itself and gave us hope in the form of giants such as Queen Regent Labotsibeni of Swaziland, Mohamed V of Morocco, Abdul Gamal Nasser of Egypt, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, Murtala Mohamed of Nigeria, Patrice Lumumba of Zaire, Amilcar Cabral of Guinea Bissau, Aghostino Neto of Angola, Eduardo Mondlane and Samora Machel of Mozambique, Seretse Khama of Botswana, W.E.B. Du Bois and Martin Luther King of America, Marcus Garvey of Jamaica, Albert Luthuli and Oliver Thambo of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By their deeds, by the struggles they led, these and many other patriots said to us that neither Carthage nor Africa had been destroyed. They conveyed the message that the long interregnum of humiliation was over. It is in their honour that we stand here today. It is a tribute to their heroism that, today, we are able to address this august gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The titanic effort that has brought liberation to South Africa, and ensured the total liberation of Africa, constitutes an act of redemption for the black people of the world. It is a gift of emancipation also to those who, because they were white, imposed on themselves the heavy burden of assuming the mantle of rulers of all humanity. It says to all who will listen and understand that, by ending the apartheid barbarity that was the offspring of European colonisation, Africa has, once more, contributed to the advance of human civilisation and further expanded the frontiers of liberty everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are here today not to thank you, dear brothers and sisters, because such thanks would be misplaced among fellow-combatants -- we are here to salute and congratulate you for a most magnificent and historical victory over an inhuman system whose very name was tyranny, injustice and bigotry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the history of our struggle is written, it will tell a glorious tale of African solidarity, of Africans' adherence to principle. It will tell a moving story of the sacrifices that the peoples of our continent made, to ensure that that intolerable insult to human dignity, the apartheid crime against humanity, became a thing of the past. It will speak of the contributions of freedom -- whose value is as measureless as the gold beneath the soil of our country -- the contribution which all of Africa made, from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea in the north, to the confluence of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa shed her blood and surrendered the lives of her children so that all her children could be free. She gave of her limited wealth and resources so that all of Africa should be liberated. She opened her heart of hospitality and her head so full of wise counsel, so that we should emerge victorious. A million times, she put her hand to the plough that has now dug up the encrusted burden of oppression accumulated for centuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The total liberation of Africa from foreign and white minority rule has now been achieved. Our colleagues who have served with distinction on the OAU liberation committee have already carried out the historical task of winding up this institution, which we shall always remember as a frontline fighter for the emancipation of the people of our continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, at this summit meeting in Tunis, we shall remove from our agenda the consideration of the question of Apartheid South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where South Africa appears on the agenda again, let it be because we want to discuss what its contribution shall be to the making of the new African renaissance. Let it be because we want to discuss what materials it will supply for the rebuilding of the African city of Carthage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One epoch with its historic tasks has come to an end. Surely, another must commence with its own challenges. Africa cries out for a new birth, Carthage awaits the restoration of its glory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If freedom was the crown which the fighters of liberation sought to place on the head of mother Africa, let the upliftment, the happiness, prosperity and comfort of her children be the jewel of the crown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There can be no dispute among us that we must bend every effort to rebuild the African economies. You, your excellencies, have discussed this matter many times and elaborated the ideas whose implementation would lead us to success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fundamental so what needs to be done are known to all of us. Not least among these are the need to address the reality that Africa continues to be a net exporter of capital and suffers from deteriorating terms of trade. Our capacity to be self-reliant, to find the internal resources to generate sustained development, remains very limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quite correctly, we have also spent time discussing the equally complex questions that bear on the nature and quality of governance. These, too, are central to our capacity to produce the better life which our people demand and deserve. In this regard, we surely must face the matter squarely that where there is something wrong in the manner in which we govern ourselves, it must be said that the fault is not in our stars, but in ourselves that we are ill-governed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tribute is due to the great thinkers of our continent who have been and are trying to move all of us to understand the intimate inter-connection between the great issues of our day of peace, stability, democracy, human rights, cooperation and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even as we speak, Rwanda stands out as a stern and severe rebuke that she will never know stability and peace, that she will never experience development and growth, that her children will forever be condemned to poverty and dehumanisation and that we shall for ever be knocking on somebody's door pleading for a slice of bread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We know it is a matter of fact that we have it in ourselves as Africans to change all this. We must, in action, assert out will to do so. We must, in action, say that there is no obstacle big enough to stop us from bringing about a new African renaissance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are happy, Mr. Chairman, to commit South Africa to the achievement of these goals. We have entered this eminent African organisation and rejoined the African community of nations inspired by the desire to join hands with all the countries of our continent as equal partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will never happen again that our country should seek to dominate another through force of arms, economic might or subversion. We are determined to remain true to the vision which you held out for South Africa as you joined the offensive to destroy the system of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vision you shared whit us was one of a non-racial society, whose very being would assert the ancient African values of respect for every person and commitment to the elevation of human dignity, regardless of colour or race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What we all aimed for was a South Africa which would succeed in banishing the ethnic and national conflicts which continue to plague our continent. What we, together, hoped to see, was a new South Africa free d of conflict among its people and the violence that has taken such a heavy toll, freed of the threat of the civil strife that has turned million of people into refugees both inside and outside our countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We all prayed and sacrificed to bring about a South Africa that we could hold out as a true example of the democracy, equality and justice for all, which the apartheid system was constructed and intended to deny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vision you shared whit us was one in which we would use the resources of our country to create a society in which all our people would be emancipated from the scourges of poverty, disease, ignorance and backwardness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objective we all pursued was the creation of a South Africa that wool be a good neighbour and an equal partner whit all the countries of our continent, one which would use its abilities and potentialities to help advance the common struggle to secure Africa's rightful place within the world economic and political system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus must we build on the common victory of the total emancipation of Africa to obtain new successes for our continent as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Chairman: We are ready to contribute what we can to help end the genocide that is taking place in Rwanda and bring peace to that troubled sister country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also join the distinguished Heads of State and Government and Leaders of Delegation sin urging a speedy implementation of the OAU and UN decisions aimed at resolving the question of Western Sahara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We extend our best wishes to the leaders and people of Angola in the fervent hope that the process of negotiations in which they are engaged will, as a matter of urgency, bring about the permanent and just peace which the people of that country so richly deserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Equally, we would like to express our deep-felt wish that the necessary measure will be taken by all concerned to guarantee the success of the peace processes in Mozambique and Liberia, to end the war in the Sudan and protect democracy and stability in Lesotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also appeal to the world community to respond in a sensitive and generous manner to the famine that threatens the peoples of East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Chairman, our delegation is also happy to announce that we have had the honour to pay the subscription that the OAU has levied for South Africa. In addition, and as a token of the commitment of the people of our country to support Africa's peace efforts, we are glad to inform the Assembly that we have also made an additional contribution of R1 million to the OAU fund for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We congratulate you, Mr. Chairman, on your election as the current chairman of the OAU and thank you, your government and people for the extraordinary welcome you have extended to us. We are indeed glad to be here because Tunisia was among the first countries on our continent to respond to our appeal for help, when we were obliged to take up arms to fight for our liberation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We thank our brother, President Hosni Mubarak, for the outstanding work he did during his chairpersonship, including the direction of the efforts of the OAU as it helped us to deal with political violence in our country and ensure the holding of free ad fair elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We salute too, our Secretary-General, H.E. Salim Ahmed Salim, the OAU Secretariat, the OAU Head of Mission to South Africa, Ambassador Joe Legwaila, the Heads of State and Government and the people of our continent who helped us successfully to walk our last mile of the difficult road to freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To you all, we would like to say that your sacrifices and your efforts have not been in vain. Freedom for Africa is your reward. Your actions entitled you to be saluted as the heroes and heroines of our time. On you shoulders rests the responsibility to restore to our continent its dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are certain that you will prevail over the currents that originate from the past, and ensure that the interregnum of humiliation symbolised by, among others, the destruction of Carthage, is indeed consigned to the past, never to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> God bless Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, June 3-7, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over 90 percent of Uganda's population lives in the rural areas, with all its negative drawbacks. Extremely low incomes, subsistence food production, disease and poverty forming a vicious cycle. In that cycle, wood fuel comes to play a very important role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a 1992 study by the Forestry Department at Uganda's Ministry of Natural Resources, the estimated per capita consumption of dry wood is one tonne per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The effect on vegetation cover is obvious here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coupled with that, is the overwhelming demand for wood fuel by the urbanites, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Uganda has a relatively small urban population (about 10 percent of total population), most of them are either civil servants or petty traders, and would never afford electricity. The Uganda Electricity Board (UEB) doubles its rates almost every six months (a unit costs about US 50 cents today)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I know it's bad to use charcoal because it is finishing our forests,&quot; said Kyambade Coach, who works with a local consultancy firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But I also know I have to cook my food on something, and I sure cannot afford electricity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kyambade earns Shs 36,000 per month (US $ 34) which is hardly enough to feed him. So electric powered cookers are out for him, as they are for hundreds of thousands of other town dwellers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their demand is met by a charcoal burning industry which is one of the fastest growing and therefore, one of the most dangerous in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is courting disaster, according to Otia Otim, the top government representative in Moroto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Maybe far off into the interior, but near the town (Moroto), the people have finished all the trees,&quot; he said. In this town, one could look 20 km across flat plains with nothing but patchy brown growth in the place of grass. And no trees at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This writer actually beheld a long stream of people, especially old men and women, carrying bundles of firewood to sell to towns like Masindi, Moroto and Ntungamo, in different parts of the country. These towns lie in the cattle corridor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Karamoja equation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To Karamoja then, and its special status as the ultimate problem case in Uganda's fragile areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vast plains of Karamoja, in the North East of Uganda, and its towering inhabitants cover 24,000 sq 300km from north to south, and 80 km from east to west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With average rainfall less then 15 inches (380mm) per annum, Karamoja is the most arid region in Uganda. Yet it supports about 500,000 people and twice that, the heads of cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similar drylands, but a little more fertile, are to be found in Ankole, further down, the cattle corridor, where most of the Bantu pastoralists live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are some more marginal lands in the rift valley region near the border with Zaire up to near Sudan. There are also some isolated pockets in Kasese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Karamoja is in a class of its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our problem is water,&quot; , said an elderly man in Iriiri, Moroto District. Iriiri, where I heard this lamentations, is ironically the most fertile part of Karamoja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Katakwi, in neighboring Teso, I met an elderly man who tried to sell me the ekicolong (a small traditional stool favored by every Karimojong male).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he had sought refuge among the Itesots because his village in Nupe sub-country, had been hit by drought since June 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had a suuka (polyester cloth) draped around his shoulders and absolutely nothing else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When they were excited (as this Mzee was when I gave him some money and he enthused Ejoku-hello), the clothes often slips and falls to the ground. No Karimojong will be in a hurry to pick it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This incidentally, is the distinct way of dress (or undress) among the Karimojong, and it was a rude cultural shock to me. And to know that these are also Ugandan citizens like me!.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Water is the one thing that is in extremely short supply in Karamoja.  While the southern part of Uganda's cattle corridor gets some rain, and has some pretty fertile areas, Karamoja defies words to describe its harsh constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Karamoja plain is driest in the eastern part, where average rainfall dips to 380mm to form shallow, coarse, sandy soils with low humus content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is lack of vegetation that really wreaks havoc on these plains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manyattas, no forests?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I asked Debbie, a Karimojong girl who runs a St. Phillips Christian Hostel in Moroto, why there is so little vegetation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Why?  Look, they use it to build their Manyattas, which have a fence, huts and the roofing,&quot; she said. Manyattas are the semi-permanent enclosures where, women, children and the old stay, living fairly sedentary lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Debbie said her people also use a lot of wood for cooking, for warming themselves, making these stools and burning for charcoal, which they sell to townspeople.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Here, we use a thermal generator, which works only six hours a day between 6:00 pm and midnight,&quot; she said. She added that the people must have alternative fuel, and those who provide it most have some form of income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because the Karimojong have an almost ritualistic reverences for cattle, everything revolves around them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is nothing us the Karimojong can do without cattle, because this place is very dry, and the crops do not do well.&quot; said Andrew Kehem, a political mobiliser in Moroto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not difficult to see why this is so. Cattle provide food (blood mixed with milk) skins for dress and sale, dowry and as sacrifice when the rains fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the warriors, as the Karimojong are called, will fight to the death, anyone who stands between them and their herds. At least those who have cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This untenable weather forces us to move with our cattle for very long distances looking for grass and waters,&quot; Kehem said. It is not uncommon for them to move 50 km away from their Manyattas in search of water. And during droughts, they move five or six those distances to other districts, notably in Teso, Acholi and Lango, Bugisu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Violent flare-ups are common, especially because the Karimojong's neighbours grow some crops as well as keep cattle, and the warriors dubious claim, that all the cattle they see are theirs. The Karimojong who have been to school, bitterly dispute this and claim it is a fabrication of their enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The competition for grass and water has translated itself into bloody episodes which have made some parts of northern Uganda ungovernable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In early April, for instance, Mzee Acuma, was shot dead by Karimojong warriors whom he caught stealing his cassava in Olilim, Lira district, are very far away from Karamoja. This Karimojong family fled to Lira to survive the drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The father of one of the warriors was fines 33 heads of cattle, but they had to be driven away from the village because of fears that the Karimojong would come and rustle them back in the still of the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is after all for cattle rustling the warriors are most known around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charles Ocan, a research fellow with Centre for Basic Research, a local concern, wrote that &quot;Cattle raids have become a serious political crisis in Uganda, affecting a population of over three million in (nine districts).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bulk of cattle raiding has tended to centre around...Karimojong politics,&quot; said Ocan in his paper: &quot;Pastoral Crisis in North Eastern Uganda -- The Changing Significance of Cattle Raids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> History of Raids</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cattle raiding is not a new phenomenon in Karamoja, but the dramatic form it has taken in the last few years, has everything to do with declining fortunes of the whole of Northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Karimojong have distinguished themselves as the ultimate and enduring rebels of our times because of this raiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cattle raiding, the elders argue, were a form of survival response by a clan to disasters resulting from cattle diseases, famine and hazards propelled by social disruptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marriage in Karamoja is one way of getting cattle and according to Kehem, &quot;the in-laws can demand anything from 10 to 100 heads for their girl.&quot; He got nine of his 46 animals from men who married his two sisters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then in 1979, at the fall of dictator Idi Amin's regime, the Karimojong descended on Moroto Barracks which had the second biggest armoury of the regime. The barracks is right in the heart of Karamoja, and the huge cache of automatic rifles, explosive and tonnes of ammunition, changes cattle raiding forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have over the years become the most feared gunmen in Uganda. They make up for their perennial lack of ammunition with deadly accuracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Karimojong do not waste bullets,&quot; said Debbie. &quot;One man, one bullet is their motto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, you cannot find any Karimojong rearing cattle without a gun and woe betide anyone who might want to take away the weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They for instance, defied President Museveni's February 1994 ultimatum to hand over their guns or face arrest. They told him to go and make a grab for the guns -- at the peril of his soldiers. And the government backed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I saw hundreds of gun-toting warriors (including naked 10-year olds), all through Karamoja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They do not shy away from using the guns to raid, either. Veterinary records in the districts of Soroti, Kumi, Mbale, Tororo and Kapchorwa indicate approximately 950,000 heads of cattle to have been raided since 1986. While the raiders could be any of many players, the Karimojong stand out more than the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sure, at the height of the insurgency in northern Uganda, both the government troops and rebels, looted and roasted hundreds of cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the Karimojong have been involved in most of these raids and this, according to an elder in Bugisu, the southern most &quot;neighbour&quot; has only worked to &quot;worsen relations with neighbours. Nationality conflicts are now sharper than ever before in this region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This has even jeopardised the safety of those Karimojong who have migrated from their region because of the persistent droughts in Moroto and Kotido.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of those who have settled in other areas, did because they lost their cattle to raiders, and cannot stay on a land which sustains only cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Central Government Representative of Moroto, Atia Otim, said he saw Karimojong who had settled in Amuria and Kapelebyong sub-counties, in neighbouring Teso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is bound to happen more often as people look for more comfortable areas,&quot; he told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is sure hard to stay in Karamoja, and live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the turn of 1993, the drought was so severe that many people starved to death. Moroto (one of Karamoja';s two districts) district officials showed me figures f 130 dead in Rupa sub-county, 106 more in Nudunget, and another 103 in Katikekile sub-county, high up in the mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Death from starvation is not uncommon in Karamoja,&quot; said Kehem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But this drought is no where near the one of 1980, or that of 1992.&quot; He is right. In 1980, it was a real catastrophic famine which hit the region, just after the 1979 devastating &quot;war of liberation&quot;, when Tanzania invaded Uganda and toppled Idi Amin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An estimated 50,000 died of starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Karimojong call that year &quot;Lobulubolu&quot; (year of empty and running stomachs). Elders told me of the famines of 1938, 1945, 1949, 1956, 1965, 1969 and 1975, but said 1980 was the ultimate test. Their worst this century, when they ate rats and residues of the local brew, &quot;malwa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as Ben Okudi who did extensive research on this subject shortages in July 1978, caused by crop failures, drought and plant disease, the government made no effort to alleviate the suffering.&quot; Then Ugandan President, Godfrey Binaisa, denied knowledge of the famine until Nick Worral, a reporter for &quot;The Observer&quot; in London forced the Uganda leader to own up to the catastrophe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And sadly, the same culture of silence still prevails in government, when it comes to reports of famine. While people were dying in Karamoja for instance, the Minister of Agriculture, Mrs. Victoria told Parliament in April, that there was no famine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A local newspaper had reported a few days earlier, that people were starving in 16 of Uganda's 39 districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nobody is dying in those districts,&quot; the minister said. She said there was just some localised droughts in the areas, but ironically, she announced that government was going to aid the areas with some foodstuffs to alleviate the serious disruptions of the drought.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, May 27-31, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I graduated from Makerere University thirteen years. Since that time I have been to some of the most distinguished universities on the face of this earth in search of knowledge (though that may not always be obvious from my scribblings).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The point here being that I feel old enough and respectably knowledgeable to say what I am going to say about Makerere,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As universities come and go, present day Makerere (where by the way I also teach journalism) both amazes and depresses me. It amazes me because of in spite of nearly everything going wrong with it in the past twenty years, it has not yet collapsed in disgrace- some of its academic programmes are very well run and very brilliant students still come to us from there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It depresses me because some of the actions of the students remind me of scenes from William Golding's Lord Of the Flies. A virtuous friend also told me the last time he visited a women's hall of residence there, he felt like he had strayed into a back street brothel. I winced, because I thought it was a bit to extreme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Tuesday the Monitor run a front page story, &quot;Makerere Hit By Bloody Weekend Clashes.&quot; According to the story, last Saturday Lumumba (men's) Hall was celebrating Lumbox day.  They took their party on a walk around the campus. In the process they trampled the Elder's platform, a &quot;sacred&quot; piece of the courtyard in Nkrumah Hall, and a jolly good bloody fight broke out. Injuries of various degrees were reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The brave Lumumbists had earlier taken their celebration to Mitchell and University halls, leaving broken pieces of glass in both places to attest to their visits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That same Saturday students from Northcote, the most ancient and honorable hall where I resided when I was at Makerere, attacked Africa Hall which was having a ball. In a very interesting choice of weapon they sprayed pepper in the dancing hall, ruining the ball.  That was the most uncivil, the Northcoters plea of justified retaliation for disparaging remarks made by the Africa hall chairperson about themselves on Capital notwithstanding. This violent and anarchic behavior has been the order of the day at Makerere in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I do not want to spend myself denouncing this violent behavior, but rather to understand it.  Significantly, on the Saturday of the Northcote pepper attack on Africa, the guest of honor at the ball was Brig. Jim Muhwezi, Director General of Internal Security Organisation. About a week earlier, his counterpart, Col. Kahinda Otafiire, Director General of the External Security Organisation, once a Nkrumist, stood on the &quot;sacred&quot; ground on which the Nkrumah-Lumumba had been fought and spoke to the students as a guest of honor at their annual party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Times have really changed. When I was at the university (the first two years of which were during dictator Idi Amin's fall), it was inconceivable that a soldier, let alone a head of a security organisation (however benign) would have been invited as a guest of honor to a university event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In our time, any female who dated a solider or an intelligence officer was stigmatised as an abominable wrench. In recent years, such a female would be envied by others. Two things have drastically changed at Makerere. The students live in what in out times would have been decried as primitive conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year I sneaked into Northcote and went to one of the rooms which I shared with another student and later lived in alone. The curtain was torn, there were two double deckers in the room- for four students. The same is true for other halls of residence, including women's. I can not imagine that you can live in a room four people and not be, at worst, mildly mentally imbalanced. I imagine one must forego certain luxuries, like entertaining visitors of the opposite sex in one's room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Needless to say in the past years when the rooms were not crowded, if you had a room to yourself it was fairly easy to entertain.  If you shared a room, it was easy to &quot;dustpan&quot; your roommate if you had a &quot;visitor&quot; because there was always some space in some other single room for him to place his or her mattress. These days it would be next to impossible to arrange alternative boarding for three roommates. I can only imagine two things happening. One, that prospective &quot;importers&quot; forego any &quot;serious&quot; entertainment of the opposite sex, or if you are &quot;dry&quot;, to use popular jargon, you camp with your guest overnight on your portion of the decker- oblivious to what must be the profound discomfort of your roommates.  This must be very dehumanising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even after the university took action to encourage students to eat in the dining halls recently, students still carry their breakfast, lunch and dinner out of the dining and eat it in their rooms or in the courtyard. In our time, this practice had already started, but it was limited to people who had guests in their rooms and did not want to bring them to eat in the dining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In those days, the business of raising standards in the room- by jazzing up the food from the university kitchen over a coil in the room- had started. But I remember in Northcote, only a few rooms were known to do it.  I, for one, would never understand how a university student could cook in the same tiny room he lived (and kept the electricity coil, saucepan, tomatoes and onions under the bed). Anyway, in Makerere until the latest crackdown, there were more coils and saucepans in students' rooms than books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The effect of this has been disastrous: It means students' socialisation at the lunch and dinner tables virtually dwindling. Therefore the civilising influence of eating at the table: buttoning up your shirt or blouse, not chomping your food, not shouting and gesticulating, and asking permission before you leave others at the table, were foregone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are just a few examples. The net result is that the students are very tensed up, frustrated, ill-mannered, and basically have not been subject to many civilising influences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, there is nothing that Makerere offers today to channel these frustrations into a creative outlet. The gymnasium is cramped and hardly functioning, the swimming pool is dry most of the time, the library is dinghy, the books have been vandalised- and the easy browsing section where one could have gone to read a &quot;Newsweek&quot; or &quot;Time&quot; magazine are not functional.  And unlike in our times, students cannot escape to town to see movies on the big screen, because the cinema houses are no more. And even if they were functional, the students of today are on average poorer then ten or fifteen years ago, There is no BOOM, yet, in addition to everything else they have to buy their own toilet paper and lightbulbs!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This frustration and anger has not transformed itself into traditional student militancy and radicalism. It has degenerated into militarism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are historical reasons for this. It started with the fall of Idi Amin in 1979. Idi Amin's regime was very hated on campus. The army and intelligence services were considered demons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most fierce competition and passionate thing at the University used to be the clash between the army's and the University's basketball and boxing teams.  We would go there charged, lose our head in excitement when we won, and weep when we lost. I have never, since that time, witnessed and basketball or boxing matched more charged. I remember the last basketball match in the main hall in 1079. There was a middle heavy weight fighting out between Peter Baingana, who later joined the NRA and defected as one of the Rwandese Patriotic Front attack on Rwanda on October 1990</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Baingana went up against a huge soldier. The soldier hammered him hard, and he was drenched all over in blood. He refused to quit the fight as the coach implored. Wobbling, with cuts all over and a blood-drenched vest, Peter came into the third round. The soldier hit him. He remained standing.  Then he attacked. He stunned the enemy with a blow. The adversary bucked into a corner. We sniffed an opportunity, jumped to our feet and bellowed &quot;Peter go get him.&quot; And he did. At the end Peter collapsed in a heap. We won by a whisker. (Peter died in combat inside Rwanda in 1990, may his soul rest in peace).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, in our times, that was how we saw our relationship with the state. That we had to put up a fight against, it, and that when they allowed to come to a field, to play, we would go the extra mile to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not any more, because students (and the country at large) were fed up with Amin and his brutes, the Tanzanian and Ugandan liberators who ousted him in 1979 became heroes on campus. Many politicians of the Uganda National Liberation and officers of the Uganda National Liberation Army were adored by university students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cause of the progressive politicians in the UNLF, like Prof. Dan Nabudere, Omwony Ojwok, Paul Wangoola, Yoweri Museveni, Ruhakana Rugunda's etc., became the cause of the student leftists. The late Brig. Oyite Ojok, became a legendary figure. It became a badge of honour to have a friend in the UNLF, or for women to date some dashing soldier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the article, &quot;The UPC-nisation of the NRM&quot; (&quot;The Monitor, May 6-10, 1994), Makerere don Joe Oloka-Onyango wrote of his view of student politics; &quot;student politics should be anti-institution, anti-establishment and radically student-centred and independent; ...neither the political parties, nor government, nor anybody external to the campus context had any business getting involved in student politics.&quot; If over the years this tradition had been declining, it went into a coma with the UNLF period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Obote II, it was clear it would not come out of the coma. The university -- students and teachers -- became split into a pro-UPC camp versus the rest. Student and university issues were no longer settled in their own right, but from the point of view of whether they were pro-UPC and anti-UPC. At that time, the most popular figure on campus (a period when UNLA and the NRA were embroiled in a war in Luwero in which UNLA was being accused of committing atrocities) was the populist late 2nd Lt. Kagata Namiti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Generation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At about the time UNLF took power, the last generation of students who had passed through primary school in the period before Amin graduation.  Thereafter, all the students who came to university had gone to primary school at a time when militarism, brutal military repression, and armed resistance to it, were the only form of politics. These students did not know anything else. When I was at Makerere, the most &quot;subversive&quot; thing was an independent-minded group of students calling themselves the &quot;Society of Free Thinkers.&quot; Today, their equivalent are the Northcote &quot;soldiers&quot; in genuine military uniform. The idea and allure of intellectualism, debate, reasoned arguments has been buried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This student-militancy-degenerated-into-militarism had its greatest moment of triumph when the NRA took power. Many NRA officers were only recently university graduates. Some of them had abandoned their studies to go to the bush to fight and returned to find their classmates still at the university. They were seen as the White knights in armour. They were romanticised, and idolised. Because scholarly rigour at the university was in decay, the intellectualism of the soldiers tempered with down-to-earth realism from the bush war, was over-powering for the students -- and most of the lecturers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new heroes on campus continued to be soldiers; Col. Kahinda Otafiire for one remains a favourite. Between 1986 to 1990, the now much-hated Education minister Maj. Amanya Mushega was all the rage. In many ways the collective intellectual community at the university succumbed to the intellectual might of the NRM/NRA cadres. The few truly independent-minded people, especially among the lecturers, were hounded or unnerved by constant harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The one form of protest that captured the student imagination was the one that was being romanticised by the NRM/NRA and had been in vogue (and continues to be) -- a military form of confrontation. To appreciate why Otafiire is a perpetual guest of honour at student events at Makerere, and why Muhwezi was the guest of honour at the Afrostone (Africa and Livingstone) event last Saturday, one needs to see that the political norm that is entrenched at the university of the NRA variety -- of the heroic soldier riding to the rescue of beleaguered civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So it was that on May 7, 1994, I returned to the great Hall, Northcote, for a Bull Roasting event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The students were dressed mostly in NRA uniform or imitation military uniforms. It was no longer the &quot;great Spirit Hall&quot;, but the &quot;State of Northcote&quot;, with its gallant army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The University authorities have banned military uniforms on campus, and the NRA Chief of Staff also announced that there should be no military uniforms worn on campus, but the Northcoters have said NO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a lot of anger and militarism in Northcote. The Bull Roasting was like a break at a war front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I could hardly comprehend the things that were being said. The speeches from the students were like military communiques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To start with, they commissioned several officers and men for &quot;specials studies.&quot; And the titles were very statist or military. Thus there was State Dustbinee, Attache Makerere Police Post, Commander State Brewery, State Assassin, State Conman, Chief Prisoner, Importer Scandalous Goods, Director Ballistics, Defiled Last State Virgin, Bodyguard to D.C., Director of Training. The list was about 75 titles long. Some of them are extremely funny and the product of creative minds; but of a creative military mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kamuntu's Show</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the Warden, Joe Pacuto, was making a point in favour of respecting the ruling against wearing military uniforms, he had to adopt military language. Thus he told them that is a neighboring enemy state's soldiers had the same uniform as yours, it was wise to change your uniform because the enemy could infiltrate your army. You could see they understood that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, remarkably, guest of honour Mile Bank MD Ephraim Kamuntu, himself a Northcoter (and now Ancestor) had done his homework and really got the students very excited and enthusiastic. Warning them of the dangers of AIDS, he told of how the forces of the Great Hall fought major wars in the past and won all of them:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We would lay ambushes in Bwaise and defeat the enemy,: he said. They roared in appreciation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We would attack Katanga (a slum full of prostitutes opposite Makerere) and score victory.&quot; More wild cheers. &quot;If there were nurses from Mulago hanging about, we would capture those too.&quot; More wild cheers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then the clincher. &quot;But those wars we won without either helmets or boots. In these modern wars, without helmets and boots (both references to condoms) you can't win wars.&quot; A deafening and near-hysterical applause went up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I looked at Kamuntu, and was hopelessly impressed by his understanding of how the university student's mind had changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was then that I understood what had happened; that the university had become more like a holding camp for politically dissenting military officers, than a battlefield of ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I imagine the clashes with the police we saw on May 10 when students of Makerere and other higher institutions of learning who were protesting the cost-sharing proposals in the White Paper on education, must have been the skirmish before the big battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus the supreme irony; the student militants at Makerere are the ideological children of the NRM. Will it be the parent who rues the day be bore such children, or the children who will forsake the parent first? Only time will tell.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE GHANAIAN CHRONICLE, May 23-25 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The slow but sure dip of the operating level of the Akosombo Hydro-electric Dam may be due to more then just an erratic rainfall pattern, or overzealous consumption of electric power by rural folk newly connected to the national grid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Chronicle&quot; investigators have come upon two new hydro-electric dams built and commissioned in 1993 by the not-so-friendly government of neighboring Burkina Faso, on the white Volta as one of the key reasons (Uganda)he lake. One of the main sources for the Volta river is the White Volta, called Nazimon by the predominant Mossi of Burkina Faso.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experts say the two dams, known as the Bagre and the Kompienga, built by financial support by France have, in effect, stalled the flow of the White Volta downstream. The Burkinabe government of Blaise Compaore had a third dam on the drawing boards to be situated on the Black Volta, or the Mouhoun, but they are yet to construct to due to lack of funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Chronicle&quot; sources in Ouagadougou and Bobo Diouallasso say the construction of the dams are not entirely without political motives. The Akosombo Dam was constructed in 1965 with a few of supplying electric power to several West African countries, including the then Upper Volta. Ghana exports electricity to Cote d'Ivoire, Togo and Benin; but the Burkina Faso waited fruitlessly for almost three decades and went ahead with its own plants when Ghana's overhead did not show up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts contend that the soured relations between Ghana and Burkina Faso following the murder of Rawlings revolutionary comrade Thomas Sankara allegedly by Compaore, prevented the development of bilateral co-operation had a common programme in hydro-electricity generation and supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, not all of Volta Dam's woes can be traced to Ghana's northern neighbors. Volta River Authority (VRA) insiders say a scandalous blunder some two years ago was committed by engineers who kept the spillways open longer then required when the dam reached the maximum operating level of 278 feet (84.73 metres).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the process, the level of the dam reportedly went down farther then it should have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Volta Dam is currently running at about 244.50 feet (74.52 metres), three and a half feet (1.07 metres) below its minimum operating level, leaving at risk the much-touted rural electrification programme of the Rawlings administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VRA officials have blamed the decline on the world's largest artificial lake to environmental and climatic factors, and to unfriendly farming practices of peasants along the river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lowering of the lake's level has forced Volta Aluminum Company (Valco) to shut down one of its four potlines, prompting the loss of more the 230 jobs. Valco, a smelting subsidiary of the giant Kaiser Aluminum Corporation of the United States is the largest single user of Ghana's hydro-electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG) has begun rationing power to domestic and other industrial consumers, Besides, Ghana, otherwise a net exporter of power, now imports from la Cote d'Ivoire's Compagnie Ivoirien d'Electricite (CIE).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Akosombo Da, Africa's biggest after Egypt's Aswan Dam, pumps out more than 900 megawatts of electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given that Burkinabe are now lighting up their country and providing energy from the same water source, and there is not telling when Heaven plans to improve the climate, the future of the Volta Dam and one of Rawling's electoral aces- rural electrification- all hang in the balance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GHANAIAN CHRONICLE, May 9-11, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African Manatee, a fresh water mammal long thought to be extinct in Ghana, has been sighted at a number of locations in the Afram Plains wing of the Volta lake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Martin A. Odei, Deputy Director-General of the centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) said in Accra that new evidence of the existence of the Manatee, popularly known as &quot;the sea cow&quot;, implies that the mammal; still has a home in the country although it may be a highly endangered species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Institute of Aquatic Biology (IAB) took delivery last month of a 260-centimeter long female Manatee captured at Gadokope in the Afram arm of the Volta lake.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experts at IAB have not been able to determine the exact weight of the Manatee which died only a few days after its capture and has since been embalmed for studies. They, however, think that the creature could weigh almost twice the size of a normal cow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have been searching all our fresh waters for the Manatee and other mammals. What we thought was extinct all these times turned out to exist in our ecosystem&quot; ,Dr. Odei said of the manatee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has been assisting the IAB with research work on marine and fresh water mammals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is also instrumental in the institute's survey programme on turtles, dolphins and lizards in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Patrick Ofori-Danson, a project co-ordinator for IAB's programme, said the Manatee's natural habitat is the brackish environments around the estuaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In Ghana, the Manatee's natural home should normally be within the Lower Volta area around Ada. But the recent sightings up country could be the result of the entrapment of the species in the Volta lake when the Akosombo dam was built&quot; ,he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Ofori-Danson said the species is obviously endangered because it has a very rigid sexual character, reproducing only one baby once in between three and five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This means that any mature Manatee we sight today is very old and may have completed this long reproductive cycle. If you shoot it, you are simply breaking the cycle&quot; ,he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Using spears and traditional harpoons, local people living along the Volta in the Afram Plains are alleged to have been hunting the sea cow for domestic consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aquatic Biologists contend however, that the Manatee, a herbivore, is important for its ability to control aquatic weeds by feeding on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Ofori-Danson appealed to the people who come into contact with the Manatee and other rare mammals to protect rather than kill since most of them &quot;are of greater value to us and our environment&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH, June 27, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Thursday, 18th November, 1993, in my maiden national broadcast, I referred to what had become obvious to every concerned Nigerian. Our beloved country was adrift, threatened with imminent anarchy and disintegration. Some component parts of the nation threatened secession. Critical elements within the society openly invited the Armed Forces to intervene to secure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Nigerian state and to stem the tide of dangerous national descent into chaos and disorder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result of this nation-wide concern about the state of our country and following intensive consultations with a wide range of interests, including the principal actors of the June 12th crisis, the Armed Forces, along with other patriotic Nigerians, took the initiative of devising a way forward, by forming a government of a grand national coalition. To facilitate reconciliation, this coalition comprised eminent and tested leaders from all shades of political opinion. It is therefore clear that this administration came in to perform a mission of national salvation. Fellow Nigerians, we have undertaken to lay a solid foundation for the growth of genuine democracy in our country. this is the agenda of our administration, we are determined to accomplish this historic task, firmly, objectively, decisively and with sincerity of purpose.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guided by mature advice from the best political insights available in the country, we considered all options that could move the nation forward.  Some of the options were practical but undemocratic. Others were emotional among a vocal few but not practicable. After exhaustive appraisal of all the options. we recognized as our best choice the convention of a constitutional conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Constitutional Conference is an opportunity for the duly elected representatives of all Nigerians to come together for unfettered national dialogue and discussions on a wide spectrum of issues confronting us as a nation. I have already signed into law the Decree establishing the conference. On 27th June, I shall inaugurate the Constitutional Conference.  The Conference Agenda has been derived from more than one thousand memoranda received from individuals and groups from all strata of our society, across the length and breadth of this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let me state categorically our firm determination to see to the successful implementation of the program towards democratization. We must warn that our pursuit of this noble objective is unequivocal and cannot be compromised. Therefore, those elements in our society engaged in acts of confrontation, sabotage, rumor-mongering, false alarms and distortion of facts must bear in mind the full consequences of their acts of disservice to the nation. They must also be prepared to face the full force of the law of the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This country is greater than any individual or group. No individual or group would be permitted to hold this country to ransom. We have had enough and we have seen enough. All well meaning Nigerians condemn the attempts of some individuals and groups seeking to translate their personal ambition into a national trauma. It is clear that the Constitutional Conference would afford any group or individual with genuine grievances, ample opportunity to discuss them. choosing the path of confrontation and subversion at this time of our national history would not be tolerated. Such acts would be sternly punished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We acknowledge the interest demonstrated by the international community concerning our great nation. We know most of you are doing so with very good intentions. We urge you to continue to appreciate fully the magnitude of our problems and give support to our determination and courage to grapple with them. We indeed hope that in the true spirit of our mutual interests, you should do nothing to encourage the idle dreams of self-seeking individuals or the parochial interests of small opportunistic groups within our society who are bent on acts of destabilization under various covers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This administration appreciates the political and economic crisis confronting us today. But, we are determined to contain and control their painful effects on our people. Indeed, the economic policies of this administration have been realistic in appraising both the depth of the crisis as well as in offering genuine short and long term solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fellow Nigerians, this Administration has a solemn responsibility to maintain the corporate existence of Nigeria. We have a responsibility to achieve this objective through the enthronement of the principle of justice, equity and fair-play. Our mission is to ensure that we establish a very enduring democratic base that will form the bed-rock for a sustainable, nationally acceptable government for our nation. We enjoin all patriotic Nigerians to participate in this great national endeavor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government wishes to thank all our citizens for their patience and show of understanding at this critical moment of our history. We ask all members of our society to continue to be peaceful and law abiding. This administration wishes to reassure everybody of our commitment and determination to protect all lives and properties. Long live the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH, June 27, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Eleganza Sports Centre in the coarse inner city area of Epetedo, Lagos Island, had no claim to fame, until Saturday, June 11. At about 7 p.m., Moshood Abiola, unofficial winner of the annulled presidential election of June 12 last year, arrived at the decrepit premises of the centre which also houses a Lagos State Health Clinic and the Palace Club, a social club of Epetedo indigenes. His mission: to declare himself President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. Abiola's action was to be the climax of the revived campaign, which started mid-last month, to claim his mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the mini-sports hall, chairs and tables, obviously borrowed from the club house, had been set up. Minutes after his arrival, word had been passed around and a crowd had formed in the sports hall, even spilling into the streets. Shouts of &quot;M.K.O., M.K.O.,&quot; rent the air. Efforts to keep the crowd quiet so Abiola could speak repeatedly failed. Abiola himself kept appealing: &quot;Let me talk, let me talk,&quot; but the crowd had been worked into a frenzy. In the end, Wahab Dosunmu, former minister of works and housing, and Ralph Obioha, former presidential aspirant, both close aides of Abiola, had to distribute Abiola's speech to the crowd.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Dapo Adebowale, a resident of Epetedo and a school teacher: &quot;Abiola only spoke for about five minutes. Those who were not near enough did not hear him. The public address system was not clear and the crowd did not allow him to speak, they kept shouting M.K.O., M.K.O.&quot; &quot;Newswatch&quot; gathered that no one actually heard Abiola declare himself president. But in his eight-page speech, Abiola declared that &quot;from this moment, a new government of national unity is in power throughout the length and breadth of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, led by me, Bashorun M.K.O.  Abiola, as president and Commander-in-Chief.&quot; He also ordered the reconvening of the National Assembly and reinstated all governors. In addition, he reinstated states assemblies and local government councils dissolved last November when Sani Abacha, a general, became head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola stated: &quot;I hereby invoke the mandate bestowed upon me by my victory in the said election to call on all members of the Armed Forces and the police, the civil and public services throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria to obey only the government of National Unity headed by me...My government of National Unity is the only legitimate constituted authority in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as of now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new development was an anti-climax to the build up to June 12.  Abiola had said he would be sworn in that day, &quot;let heavens fall.&quot; &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt that his declaration was actually to be followed by a swearing-in ceremony conducted by a retired judge. This did not happen. Also there were no representatives of the local and foreign news media at his purported declaration. The first time Nigerians heard the news was late Saturday night through the BBC. Both the BBC and CNN broadcast the news several times the next day. The BBC also broadcast an interview with Abiola.  The venue and circumstances of the declaration were not clear. Also no copes of Abiola's declaration was made available to the press. Abiola's choice of a mini sports centre in the back streets of Lagos for his declaration remains a big puzzle. But &quot;Newswatch&quot; gathered that Dosunmu, a member of the Palace Club, the social club and night spot which is located inside the Eleganza Sports Centre, might perhaps have convinced Abiola to make his declaration there to escape arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Throughout the week preceding Abiola's declaration, there was an immense build-up to June 12 that had raised anxiety and excitement to a critical level. Threats and counter-threats were traded between Abiola and the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, on the one hand and government on the other. For instance, at a conference on &quot;change and challenge on South Africa&quot; June 8, Abiola had challenged government to arrest him. promising that he will be &quot;sworn-in&quot; as president by the first anniversary of the annulled election. In a press conference by the police, June 10, Nuhu Aliyu, a deputy inspector-general of police in charge of operations, warned Abiola not to form a parallel government or he would be charged for treason. The police also sealed off Moshood Abiola Crescent, where Abiola's residence is located and his campaign office, Hope '93, on Opebi Road, both in Ikeja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the morning of June 11, the anxiety that gripped the nation took a dip when Abiola announced that he had postponed his plans to form a parallel government by June 12. His decision, he said, was informed by letters from Reverend Abiodun Adetiloye, the Anglican archbishop, to NADECO urging them to delay for a few days. Abiola was quoted by newspapers as saying; &quot;As a man who respect the religious beliefs of our people and based on the unanimous advice of our leaders of the NADECO, I confirm to you the postponement of the swearing-in ceremony.&quot; He promised a later date would be fixed for the ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By Saturday afternoon, however, the police had moved against Abiola.  They sealed up the premises of his newspapers, the &quot;Concord&quot; group and &quot;The Punch.&quot; The police claimed that arms and ammunitions were being stored in the premises of the newspaper houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bola Kolawole, editor of &quot;The Punch,&quot; who was in his office when the police moved in, was not allowed out the &quot;The Punch&quot; premises. Last week, Kolawole regained freedom following a suit at the Federal High Court filed by Gani Fawehinmi. The court ordered the police to vacate the premises of both newspaper houses. But the police are yet to respond to the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Demola Osinubi, general manager of &quot;The Punch,&quot; told &quot;Newswatch&quot; last week that he did not know why government linked his paper with Abiola. Said Osinubi: Abiola has no kobo in &quot;Punch.&quot;&quot; According to him, former President Ibrahim Babangida also proscribed &quot;The Punch&quot; last year along with the &quot;Concord,&quot; claiming that Abiola gave the paper money and newsprint. &quot;It is a campaign of mischief,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police declared Abiola wanted also on Saturday evening. In a statement, the police said that they had uncovered &quot;laid down plans to cause public disorder, breakdown of law and order and a plot to forcefully overthrow the federal government.&quot; They had established that Abiola's activities &quot;enjoyed tacit support of certain foreign missions in Lagos.&quot; The police offered a N50,000 reward to anyone who helps them to arrest Abiola.  Many people saw this level of price on the head of such a wealthy man as a way of ridiculing him by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In reaction to the police allegation, the American embassy denied that Abiola had take refuge at the embassy in Lagos. Arlene Jacquette, information officer at the United States Information Service, the USIS, said that although the United States supports democratic process, it does not support individuals, we recognise countries.&quot; She said that the US had been consistent in this policy, adding: &quot;A year ago, we were calling for the release of the result of the election and the installation of the winner.  That is still our policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jacquette said the US would not relax &quot;sanctions (against Nigeria) unless concrete steps towards the installation of a civilian government are taken.&quot; Such steps must be broad-based and widely acceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another diplomat said that the meeting Abiola had with Congressmen in the US was purely to get Congress educated on the goings-on in Nigeria. He said that although Abiola had declared himself president, he would not get US government support because the government does not support individuals. The diplomat said that although Abiola may have his reasons for going into hiding, &quot;it is not a good move to get support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Newswatch&quot; gathered that although the police action against Abiola was approved by Aso Rock, government decided to later stop the action.  Dependable &quot;Newswatch&quot; sources said some government officials felt that by sealing up Abiola's residence and arresting him, government might unwittingly play into the hands of Abiola who might over-dramatise his arrest to win public sympathy. Following this new line of reasoning, frantic efforts were made to get in touch with Ibrahim Coomasie, the inspector-general, to stop action. He could not be reached, so the police went ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Abiola appeared to be one step ahead of the police. Shortly after making his declaration, Abiola disappeared into the night and has not been seen since, except to be heard talking to the BBC by phone. An evidently embarrassed police force was at pains to explain how Abiola slipped through a tight security cordon. Tunji Alapini, an assistant commissioner and Lagos State police spokesman, said Abiola sneaked out of his house disguised as a woman wearing a veil in the midst of women similarly dressed. &quot;The question of beating police security does not arise under such circumstance,&quot; Alapini said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aliyu dismissed Abiola's declaration, saying there was no event at the Eleganza Sports Centre in which Abiola declared himself president. According to him, the venue of declaration was close enough to the detachment of policemen at Idumota (a kilometre away), the Lion Buildings (about 500 metres) and the Force Headquarters (700 metres). Aliyu said no such ceremony with a gathering of 3,000 could have taken place without the knowledge of the police. &quot;Newswatch&quot; confirmed that the Sandgross police barracks is about 70 metres away from where the ceremony took place and the Adeniji Adele police station is about the same distance. Yet the police, which had been on security alert since a fortnight ago, was not at the venue of Abiola's declaration. However, the mode of Abiola's declaration and his prompt disappearance may not have attracted the attention of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola's Saturday night action change government plan too. &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt that Abacha was, in event of a public declaration by Abiola, to declare a state of emergency and impose martial law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aso Rock found Abiola's action so laughable that Abacha no longer found it necessary to take that line of action. After his broadcast Sunday morning, Abacha flew to Tunis for the 30th Summit of Organisation of Africa Unity, OAU, heads of state and government, an indication that the declaration was given little importance by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But last week, government alleged that large sums of money had been disbursed to thugs and miscreants by disgruntled elements in the west with instructions to attack innocent people. The statement, issued by the office of the chief of general staff, CGS, said the aim was to provoke retaliation and cause public disorder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his nation-wide broadcast June 12, Abacha promised that his government would keep the pledge to institute a viable democracy. He said all those with grievances should go to the constitutional conferences to iron them out. The head of state warned, however, that his government, which he maintained was invited to take over power buy the politicians themselves, would deal decisively with anyone who challenged it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola's disappearance has had a dampening effect on the renewed struggle for June 12. On Monday, June 13, there were sporadic riots in parts of Lagos and Ondo states which were promptly put under control by security forces. In Lagos, banks were not opened and shops closed down in the morning in what was initially thought to be in response to the one week protest called by the Campaign for Democracy, CD. But by Tuesday, Lagos had come alive again, which showed that people had stayed indoors out of fear rather than obedience to the call buy the CD. Pockets of protest were also reported in Ilorin, the Kwara State, and Ile-Ife, Osun State, where students f the Obafemi Awolowo University clashed with the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fawehinmi told &quot;Newswatch&quot; last week that he does not agree with Abiola's going into hiding. Said he: &quot;There was no cause of it. What is worth fighting for is worth dying for.&quot; Fawehinmi added that since Abiola had declared himself president, which should have been done earlier than now, he should &quot;stick to it and fight it to the end. That is my advice to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola's close associates are also in hiding. &quot;Newswatch&quot; gathered that Abiola and his advisers have been holding meetings on how to sustain the campaign. By Wednesday, it was agreed that Abiola should come out of hiding. It was also agreed that Abiola must meet the local press either last Friday or early this week. But events did not appear to have been firmed up.  Bola Tinubu, a former senator and close associate of Abiola who is himself out of circulation, told &quot;Newswatch&quot;: &quot;We are still working on the logistics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, Kudirat, Abiola's wife, added a new twist to this new plan.  She told the BBC that her husband was ill and would come out soon to speak to the press and also give himself up to the police as soon as he was well. She denied he was in hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Close aides of Abiola told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that he is suffering from sore throat and exhaustion. &quot;We have to wait for medical advice before he goes for the press conference, otherwise he would not be able to talk,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spate of arrests, which began the week preceding Abiola's declaration, tapered off although last week, there were reports that Sam Mbakwe, former governor of Imo State, and Ezekiel Izuogu, a key member of the defunct Social Democratic Part, SDP, were arrested.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH, June 13, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian soldier, the Nigerian civilian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The good Lord made them both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The one to wear starched uniform,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other to wear whatever catches his fancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The one not to be bloody,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other to be bloody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To the civilian, the good Lord said;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You are the political head of this territory given to your ancestors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You shall look after the land</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You shall take care of my people who shall be your people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thou shalt see to the care of their welfare</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thou shalt give them water and light and roads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For their health, thou shalt give them hospitals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their general happiness and welfare shall be thine own concern and responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thou shalt protect those who abide by the laws from those who break the laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thou shalt look after my people through the instrumentality of the covenant with the people which shall be known as the constitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By no other covenant shalt thou govern my people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civilian said to the good Lord:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thy commands, Lord, shall I obey,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even my children and my children's children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the book shall I abide</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And by the book shall I rule my people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To the soldier the good Lord said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civilian shall equip thee with starched uniform, guns, bombs and grenades and all the instruments of death</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With these, thou shalt keep safe the territorial integrity of the land of your father and your forefathers and of generations to come</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thou shalt prevent the acquisition thereof of the land</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By those hungry for more land</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With thy weapons, thou shalt prevent from acquiring power those who shall seek the short cut to rule my people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thou shalt take orders for the use of thy weapons from the civilian whom I have put in charge of the welfare of my people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then the soldier said to the Lord:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thy order, Lord, I obey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then the serpent came to the soldier and the serpent asked the soldier:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hast thou tasted the fruits of political power?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The soldier said to the serpent: No,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The good Lord hath said the fruit shalt be eaten only by the civilian who he hath put in charge of the welfare of his people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My duty is to guard the fruit not eat it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For it is forbidden that I eat the fruit thereof</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then the serpent said to the soldier:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You fool</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wilt thou allow thyself to guard the fruit and not taste it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wilt thou condemn thyself to carrying the gun and the bullet and the bomb waiting for an enemy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Must thou allow thyself to guard the room when the master eateth his fill and throws thee the crumbs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> See thou not his mansions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And his expensive cars?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> See thou not his privileges in every corner of the land?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> See thou not his healthy bank account</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Or the records waxed in his name and the chieftaincy titles bestowed on him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Or his praises sung in the press?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Must thou be denied these things</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of thine starched uniform?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then the serpent said to the soldier:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civilian giveth thee the gun and the bullets and the bomb and the bayonet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Use, I sayeth to thee, what thou hast to get what thou needeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The soldier thought hard and remembered the story of Adam and Eve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through Eve and the serpent man was driven out of the Garden of Eden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The soldier said to himself:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria is not a Garden of Eden;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is excusable for a woman to fail but for a soldier to fail, it is abomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then the soldier said to himself:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the gun how can I be wrong?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus it came to pass</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the soldier turned the gun and the bullets on the civilian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus it came to pass that the soldier ate the fruit of political power and, finding it sweet, said to the civilian, &quot;You cheat!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So the civilian reminded the soldier of the good Lord's division of labor but the soldier said to the civilian:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civilian and the soldier, the good Lord made them both and both shall eat the fruit of political power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the civilian said to the soldier:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You desecrate your oath</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the soldier said to the civilian:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You desecrate the book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The common-sense said to both,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let there be compromise,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let the soldier rule</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and let the civilian rule</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let the fruit go round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civilian says no but yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, the soldier and the civilian came to this problem:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> how long shall each rule?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And which, pray, is the aberration?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pox on the serpent?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Curse not God's creature</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the good Lord</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Never intended</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the fruit shall be forbidden to some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And free to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And thereby hangs this tale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the khaki and the agbada and other clothes in between and the nth constitutional conference.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TELL, June 13, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Any moment from now, Newswatch Communications Limited will be locking horns with Funmilayo Oni-Okpaku, high court judge and chairman of the Miscellaneous Offences Tribunal, on a neutral ground -- the civil court.  Following the four-day detention of six of its journalists by Oni-Okpaku without any formal charge about two weeks ago, Newswatch has given the go-ahead for its lawyers to commence a civil action against the tribunal chairman. Despite begin the accuser, the judge had summoned the journalists to appear before her on Friday, 27, and without much qualms ordered them to be kept in custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is the second detention the magazine will be contesting in less than two months. The first which is now subject of a N15 million suit was ordered by the military government over the magazine's publication of an interview with David Mark, a retired brigadier-general. Oni-Okpaku who wielded the big stick this time had summoned Ray Ekpu, Soji Akinrinade, Mike Akpan, Wale Akin-Aina, Sam Olukoya, Tunde Asaju, Godwin Agbroko, Olu Ojewale and Abdulrazaq Mogaji. Three of the Ojewale, Agbroko, now editor of &quot;The Week&quot; and Mogaji were absent and so escaped detention. All nine were involved in writing the cover story of the March 7 edition of &quot;Newswatch&quot; titled &quot;Exclusive Drug Scandal: The inside story.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Newswatch&quot; had seized the opportunity of the celebrated case of Joe Brown Akubueze, an alleged drug baron tried by Oni-Okpaku to generally look at the happenings in the Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, the Miscellaneous Tribunal and the Ministry of Justice. The story reflects an allegation that the tribunal chairman had bought a Mercedez Benz 230 saloon, LA 3865 DC, impounded from a drug suspect, as well as her response when confronted with the allegation. Nevertheless, Oni-Okpaku said the story contains a false, malicious and libelous report about her as chairman of the tribunal. Beside the alleged libel, she claimed the report amounted to contempt of court since Akubueze's appeal was still pending. Oni-Okpaku who said she had notified the Nigeria Press Council, NPC, believed the publication was a calculated attempt to lower her integrity and prejudice the appeal hearing. Hence, she was unsparing in pouring her venom on them. To her, they are &quot;men of small minds&quot; who practice journalism fit only for the trash can. &quot;You are not to be trusted in upholding the truth. You have behaved not like a newspaper of repute, but like an enemy of the nation out to discredit my integrity...&quot; She railed at them on end. Exasperated by her action, Gani Fawehinmi, leading counsel for &quot;Newswatch&quot; took up the cudgels for his clients. He described the judge's procedure that day as most unprecedented and unusual. Apart from producing a letter by Bappah Muhammed Jama'are, former Director-General and Chief Executive of NDLEA, claiming she bought the mercedez benz car in question, Fawehinmi said the judge had only complained instead of reading out a charge. &quot;You are the accuser and the judge this morning ,&quot; he said, adding that her conduct was a negation of section 33 (i) of the 1979 constitution restored by Decree 107 of 1993.  Pointing out the impropriety of bringing the case before her, Fawehinmi said she could have allowed the justice ministry or the police to raise a charge.  He claimed that everything she had done so far was &quot;a legal nullity&quot; and that she had allowed her personal interest to becloud her judicial oath. Since, having spoken from the bench, she could not be sued by the journalists, Fawehinmi said she should apologise to them for her tirade. Rather than an apology, Oni-Okpaku gave an order for their detention. Their counsel's application for bail was deferred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monday May 30, however the chairman released the journalists. In her ruling, the judge said she was in possession of a report of Federal Investigations and Intelligence Bureau, FIIB, countering Jama'are's written allegation and exonerating her. According to her, the FIIB findings say the car was disposed of the Messrs. A. O. Emoni Enterprises, by the secretary to her tribunal without her authority or that of Fulani Kwajafa, Jama'are's predecessor. No punishment, from any court, she believed, would be adequate for the journalists. So, she said, she was discharging them, &quot;leaving you to your conscience and to the Nigeria Press Council.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the session that day was to end in confusion as the table was turned against the judge who had sought to pillory the journalists and their counsel. In response to her ruling, Fawehinmi had complained about lack of formal charge against his clients whereupon Oni-Okpaku threatened to walk him out. Fawehinmi stood his ground, saying there was no justification for punishing his clients for four days when they had not committed any offence.  And she ordered the police to walk him out. But the people overruled her. To her amazement, the spectators at the tribunal surged forward to prevent the order from being carried out. In the ensuing confusion, she fled the tribunal room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, in no way, placated the editors. Soji Akinrinade, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of &quot;Newswatch&quot;, said he was baffled at Oni-Okpaku's action.  In the course of investigating the story, he said, she was given the opportunity of giving her won version which was reflected in the publication.  Besides, after the edition came out, she was given audience by Ekpu and Akin-Aina when she requested a meeting. Her complaint then was the fact that &quot;Newswatch&quot; gave more than once page to Akubueze's profile when her own judgment came after the magazine had gone to bed. And, in the following edition, the judgment was reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oni-Okpaku's summons might have surprised the &quot;Newswatch&quot; team, but the detention did not catch them unawares. They had been put on their guard by the unusualness of fixing Friday for such summons and the fact that no formal charge was preferred. So, they prepared their minds for the worst. The Friday coincided with the sending of their response to NPC's demand for explanation based on Oni-Okpaku's complaint. However, the judge apparently did not care much about the involvement of the council to which interestingly she said she was leaving the journalists after discharging them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If she felt any pain as a result of the experience, Akinrinade said it was form the fact that it was not the military government detaining them in such a manner now, but someone from the judiciary which is supposed to be the last hope of the common man. He wondered what would have happened to anybody of less social standing. His disillusionment was however mitigated by the behaviour of the policemen he encountered during their detention. &quot;Now, I know some policemen can be absolutely decent and human,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting to the detention, Sylvester Odion-Akhaine, General Secretary of Campaign for Democracy, CD, said it was a reflection of the general decadence in the judiciary which CD hopes to tackle in a sovereign national conference. Alfred Ilenre, secretary of Ethnic Minority Rights Organisation of Africa, EMIROAD was of the same opinion. Oni-Okpaku's behaviour, he said, &quot;was a display of emotionalism. Her tirade at the tribunal, he continued, is not expected of a high court judge no matter the provocation, because any careless statement from that sacred body (judiciary) can upset it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SUNDAY NATION, May 29, 1994;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rent boycott could take another three to six months to resolve and this could place a tremendous strain on the implementation of the Reconstruction and Development Programme(RDP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there are as yet no immediate plans to crackdown on rent defaulters with leading community representatives, consultants and politicians arguing that any campaign to end the boycott will only succeed once legitimate local authorities are in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khehla Shubane for the Wits University Centre for Policy studies told Sunday Nation this week that township residents would remain reluctant to end the boycott unless local authorities, who enjoy the necessary political legitimacy, are put into office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That could, however, take another six months, with local authority elections only scheduled for November this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the head of the ANC's delegation in the central Witwatersrand Metropolitan Chamber, Mathole Motshekga, the transition to democratically elected local authorities will take place in three stages- with each phase lasting at least three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it is possible that rent defaulters could be convinced to begin paying once the second stage in the process, represented by the coming into existence of transitional metropolitan councils, is reached in about June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shubane says legislation compelling residents to pay will only be enforceable if such laws enjoy the necessary legitimacy in communities affected by the rent boycott. The capacity to act against people for defaulting on rents must be underpinned by the legitimacy of the authorities which take such action, Shubane said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week Housing Minister Joe Slovo warned that the RDP would be in jeopardy unless the rent boycott was ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pretoria-Witwatersrand Vereeniging (PWV) provincial legislature's ministry of housing and local government is flexing its muscles to tackle the daunting task of breaking the culture of non-payment of rents and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PWV Minister of Housing and Local Government Daniel Mofokeng will address the National Civic Organization (Sanco) branch meeting in Tembisa on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This will mark the beginning of a major campaign to improve communication between local councils and residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People will be constantly reminded of the services and finance agreement which was signed by President Nelson Mandela and then President FW de Klerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agreement provides for the writing-off of all arrears up to December 31, 1993, and the resumption of payment for rent and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rent issue will receive special attention during Sanco's meeting in Tembisa today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This volume of original essays provides a sober assessment of the economic consequences of the Ethiopian Revolution, 1974-91. And as such, it fills important gaps in the literature on the Ethiopian economy. Three types of papers were solicited: those dealing with the structural features of late development (modeling a peasant economy, the theoretical underpinnings of state-led and market-led development), those melding current debates in development economics with sectoral surveys (agricultural development, industrialization), and those providing microeconomic analyses of selected issues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addresses gender issues and raises questions including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * What use are manpower and agricultural surveys when women have been labeled as housewives, unpaid family workers or farmers' wives?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * How often are women invisible in official labor force statistics, when in fact their hours of economically valuable activity, maintaining family dependents, are frequently greater than those of their male counterparts.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * How are the bearing, nursing and socializing of the next generation being combined with women's heavy work schedules?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * How do models of family relations and domestic organization need to be built in order to reflect African realities more effectively?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 1983, the civil war in southern Sudan has claimed the lives of some 1.3 million civilians as a result of targeted killings, indiscriminate fire, or starvation and disease. Both government and rebel forces are culpable as they wage war in total disregard for the welfare of civilians, violating almost every rule of war applicable in an internal armed conflict.  Government forces have engaged in indiscriminate aerial bombardments, scorched earth tactics, torture, disappearance and summary executions. The two factions of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army have engaged in indiscriminate attacks, destruction of property, looting, and long-term sieges that starve civilians. The cumulative effect has been to turn Sudan's southern region into a permanent emergency situation where war, flood, drought, and disease have torn apart ordinary survival strategies and made millions dependent in whole or in part on international assistance.</SPAN></P>

It shows that the most egregious violations -- such as massacres, torture, and slavery -- have been accompanied by more insidious forms of de facto discrimination against the black Africans, aimed at ensuring their marginalization from the rest of sociey and depriving them of their fundamental human rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the signing of an international peace accord in May 1991 and the holding of multiparty elections the following September, hopes that the Angolan economy could be rapidly rebuilt were dashed by the country's return to full-scale war. There is guarded optimism that a lasting peace for this resource-rich nation may be achievable soon. The author provides a sector-by-sector summary assessment of the historical context, present status, and future potential of Angola's oil and other resource and infrastructure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 29, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would be asking too much to expect the White House Conference on Africa, the first in recent memory, to develop the recipe for the solution to all of Africa's problems. The African continent is much too vast, diverse and complex, too far from the American mainland; and the United States is saddled with its own problems, in addition to the global problems besetting her as the world's only remaining super power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opportunity should nonetheless not be missed to note the particular significance of this historic conference, coming as it does at a time when the African continent is bleeding, to an extent perhaps without parallel since the Atlantic Slave Trade. From Algeria to Angola, from Liberia to Rwanda and Somalia, the continent is gripped with fear, desperation, destruction and death. All of this is in addition to the normal problems of economic decline, poverty, stagnation and backwardness that attend regimes, found throughout the continent, which persist in corruption, mismanagement and widespread human rights abuse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation is so bad that African leaders themselves seem to have no clue as to what to do about these problems; and the inertia of the international community in the face of the mounting post-Cold Ward problems makes a distinct mockery of a world which should have, since Gorbachev, been made &quot;safe for democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even in this state of despair and pessimism, however, it is to the credit of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) that their timely intervention in Liberia in August 1990 prevented, to some extent, the terrors that have consumed Rwanda. Yet, unfortunately, intransigence on the part of the warring factions persists, resulting in a stalemate in the Liberian peace process, continued sporadic killings and a delay of the elections that should usher the country into democratic civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The capacity for reason and peace seems still to be eluding, also, warlords and leaders in Somalia, Sudan, Angola, Zaire and other places; while in other parts of the continent, AIDS, TB, etc., as well as the general economic, social and political malaise are sapping the energies, even the existence, of our people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security advisor, is right that the present and future generation of African leaders cannot go on blaming other people for Africa's problems. They must make conscientious and persistent efforts to deal with those problems, as only they can. The trouble is, all too many of our leaders and people don't want to face the reality of their problems; but rather bask in the illusion that the problems are of external origin or stem from internal &quot;trouble makers&quot;. This is one of the reasons many in the international community throw up their hands in the face of Africa's mounting crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is praiseworthy that the Clinton administration, while it could be taking much more concrete action to help us, has at least decided to discuss the problems at the highest level of government. We pray that the panelists will take their task very seriously and approach it from the broadest possible perspective. It is easy for intellectuals in the USA, who have either read much about, or visited Africa a few times, to assume that they know all the answers to all the problems. That has, unfortunately, been the failing of many a State Department, World Bank or IMF regime, resulting in a foreign policy that has made many costly, even tragic mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We hope that the White House conference will achieve some tangible results which would, among other things, help lead to a decisive end to the wars in Angola and Liberia and the resolutions of the crises in Somalia, Rwanda and Zaire. The issues of economic reform, debt and the improvement in the quality of life of the African people are also critical to the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is hoped that policy proposals submitted will engender a new and enduring US-Africa relationship that will contribute substantively and wholesomely to world peace and human development.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 30, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As members of Interaction, the nation's largest coalition of private humanitarian agencies, we are distressed by the appalling lack of action by the international community to take concerted and deliberate action to stop the killing in Rwanda; to provide expanded humanitarian assistance to the displaced, and to pursue a reconciliation process that would provide greater stability throughout Central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We call upon President Clinton to take immediate steps to provide U.S.  resources and initiatives to address these concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We commend the President for his stated commitment on June 27th to make Africa a major priority of his foreign policy, but we recognize, as we are sure the President does, that such a commitment has little value unless it is matched with concurrent action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We believe the most pressing issue facing the United States today regarding Africa is the apparent lack of policy toward the on-going genocide in Rwanda. We strongly recommend that the President exercise the moral leadership of his office in addressing the issue of genocide and in explaining to the American people why the United States must respond in the face of this enormous tragedy. Specifically, we urge the President to do the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * provide immediate logistical and financial support for an African peacekeeping force whose mission is to protect civilians and to stop the killing. One example of our concern: dozens of U.S. armored vehicles, which could have been operational weeks ago, have not been deployed to the region.  These vehicles are vital if the international community is to succeed in replacing French peacekeepers with an African peacekeeping force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * expand humanitarian assistance to hundreds of thousands of civilians now living in camps inside Rwanda and in neighboring countries. We call on the President to join leaders of U.S. humanitarian aid groups in urging the American people to support efforts to provide food and medical supplies to Rwandan refugees. The refugee crisis is not over. The United States should play an active role in making contingency plans to address the potential needs of as many as 700,000 additional displacements in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * recommend to the U.N. Security Council that radio broadcasts encouraging the slaughter of civilians be stopped. Radio transmissions controlled by supporters of genocide continue to incite violence in Central Africa. Reports in recent days indicate that a new radio station is broadcasting into Burundi and Tanzania seeking to inflame ethnic tensions.  The United States and the United Nations should take immediate action to shut down such broadcasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * acknowledge that the killing of several hundred thousand Rwandans is the result of a planned, systematic genocide.  As a signatory to the Genocide Convention, the United States is obligated to work with other nations to identify and bring to justice those who have planned and carried out these plans. The President should support efforts in the United Nations calling on the U.N. Commission on Human Rights to fulfill its mandate in investigating these crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * support reconciliation efforts throughout Central Africa. The President should lend his political and diplomatic support for regional negotiations among Central African leaders to prevent additional ethnic conflicts and to provide greater stability in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following Interaction agencies urge the President to take these steps:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africare</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Baptist World Alliance</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JUNE 30, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Task Force on Foreign Affairs I am pleased to join InterAction in urging greater Administration support for stopping the genocide in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like the Congressional Black Caucus, the voluntary humanitarian organizations that belong to InterAction make up the conscience of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rene Degni-Segui, UN Human Rights Investigator, just returned from Rwanda and in his preliminary report said, &quot;hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and moderate Hutus have been killed in Rwanda.&quot; I repeat, he &quot;hundreds of thousands.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN Human Rights Investigator, the distinguished Dean of the Law School in Abidjan has confirmed what the world feared, that genocide had happened. For all those disbelievers who thought this could &quot;never happen again,&quot; it did, and right under our eyes. There is no excuse for our country or the international community to be late in responding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two days ago I met with the Secretary General of the OAU, Mr. Salim Admed Salim, who expressed great frustration in successfully enlisting eight African countries to volunteer troops, only to not be supported by the US and other Western countries in guaranteeing the necessary funds and logistical support to immediately send them into Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States did promise 50 armored personnel carriers to be in place weeks ago, but as of this date only 30 have arrived in Uganda and they still are not in use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) Officers are exasperated at how little response there has been to calls for reinforcements when the French Operation Turquoise was able to take place so rapidly,.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On May 4th the Congressional Black Caucus sent a letter to President Clinton urging him to see that the United States gives aggressive and positive leadership through the UN Security Council to immediately address the problems in Rwanda. Much to our dismay our UN Representative, Madeleine Albright, has done the opposite; participating in one stalling maneuver after another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The respected OXFAM/UK has actually accused the United States of being responsible for much of the slaughter due to our &quot;stalling&quot; actions. After a series of setbacks on US policy for Africa, this was the major reason for the lack of meaningful participation in the recent White House Conference on Africa. These concerns were conveyed to President Clinton in a second letter of June 16, 1994. We are still waiting for a written reply to both letters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, we are encouraged by this show of support for our position demonstrated by the presence of the many US humanitarian agencies today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> July 6, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We came to this beautiful, but tragic country at the invitation of the Liberian Council of Churches (LCC) and the Carter Centre. Our visit was not intended to offer an infallible blueprint for peace and reconciliation, but to hear from a wide range of people and to be sensitive to what has happened and what might occur in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also commend all those Liberians and others who have made contributions to efforts for peace and reconciliation, especially our brother Rev. Canaan Danana of Zimbabwe and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and Mr. Trevor Gordon-Somers, the special representative of the UN Secretary General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We commend the work of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) and the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) within their respective mandates.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We commend our brothers and sisters in Liberia's religious communities for their tireless attempts to bring about the peace Liberians yearn for, especially the LCC and the Interfaith Mediation Committee of Liberia. We thank the Carter Centre for its support and assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We were graciously received by his excellency David D. Kpomakpor, Chairman of the Council of State of the Liberian National Transitional Government (LNTG) and the four other members of the council of state. We also met with the following leaders of carious factions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), General Hezekiah Bowen;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Liberia Peace Council (LPC), Dr. George Boley;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- LOFA Defense Force (LDF), Mr. Francois Massaquoi;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), Mr. Charles Taylor;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Roosevelt Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also met with a wide range of diplomatic, political, government, church, non-governmental and peace and reconciliation representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are grateful for the frank exchange of views and information and wish to commend all Liberians for their resilience and fortitude in the face of the on-going nightmare that their country has become.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are heartened by the desire of everyone we met for immediate peace and an end to violence. Without exception all people we spoke with expressed a commitment to peace and we are deeply impressed by those words and the willingness to allow Liberians the right to choose freely who will govern them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We received, in the presence of the Chairman of the Council of State who accompanied us to Gbarnga, a special commitment from Mr. Taylor for an immediate ceasefire, a person-to-person meeting with Mr. Kpomakpor as soon as possible to discuss urgent matters of state and a commitment to a &quot;summit&quot; meeting in the near future with all factional leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are gratified that, after speaking with all the key persons in the Liberian conflict, a consensus exists on the need for an immediate ceasefire and full disarmament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We drew heavily; on our South African experience as an important example for Liberia:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- An apparently intractable situation can be resolved when people have the will and the hope that Liberians seem to have;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- When a country like South Africa, which could be splintering for many reasons can come together into one nation, then peace and reconciliation can be achieved in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We call on all nations supplying arms to warring factions to desist.  Without arms, the war is more difficult to prosecute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have assured the LCC, the religious community, the Carter Centre and the various groups with whom we spoke that the AACC stands ready to continue this process and, if desired, the AACC's General Secretary, Rev.  Jose Chipenda, will contact the LCC about the most useful way to follow up on our visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We reiterate today the message we have given several times at very moving and crowded worship services in various parts of the country and in all our meetings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- There is hope, there is an end to the nightmare;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- God has not forgotten Liberia: God will use human hands to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bring peace, reconciliation, justice and prosperity to your</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Be assured of our constant prayers for Liberia and our fervent belief that peace will come to this beloved land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">REMARKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON AFRICA</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Lake, National Security Advisor</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2427 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A very warm welcome to the White House conference on Africa. I can't tell you what pleasure it gives me to say those words. (Laughter.) I think this is the first such gathering of regional experts ever sponsored by the White House. And I am particularly pleased and excited that our focus is on Africa. In fact, I've heard an ugly rumor around that the choice of topics might have something to do with my own personal prejudices. And I want to tell you that ugly rumor is absolutely true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As I said, this is our first effort in drawing together a group like this in seeking a very wide range of views. So I hope you won't hesitate to tall us at the end of the conference where we went right and where we went wrong, and that you won't keep your opinions to yourselves. And somehow I'm not worried on either score, looking out on you.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of us are reminded that we live in exciting and very uncertain times. The Cold War is history; democracy is on the march around the world; technology and commerce are drawing us closer together. And this exciting new world challenges us to think and act anew. And that's why it's so important that you are here. As I was saying to Jim Grant just now, none of us in such a new world which does so challenge our thinking should let slip any opportunity to plagiarize. And I look forward to our plagiarizing your ideas in the coming weeks and months and even years ahead of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa, like the rest of the world, captures our attention and emotions as rarely ever before. Nations consumes by conflict live side by side with those struggling quietly for success. Headlines speak one day of ethnic massacres and the next day of democracy's advances. The terrible problems of African nations and the pessimism they can breed are matched only in scope by the Continent's huge potential. In recent months, events in South Africa and Rwanda have starkly illustrated those contradictions, and offered sharply different pictures of Africa's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Had anyone of us come before a group like this half a decade ago and predicted what would happen in South Africa, we would've laughed him or her right off of the podium. But Nelson Mandela is the elected leader of a free South Africa, and we live in a post-apartheid world. And whenever we feel overwhelmed by the troubles that face Africa, we should remind ourselves of those wonderful pictures of South Africans standing in line, waiting for hours and days to cast their votes in free and fair elections. And then we should repeat to ourselves that magic phrase, &quot;President Mandela.&quot; Just think about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While south Africa's citizens have proved that political courage and personal will can triumph over the habits of history, recent evidence from Rwanda tells a much different story. It's a story of ethnic hatred transformed into genocide, the story of unspeakable physical horror, of generations and families lost to rifles and machetes. It's a test case of one of the great security challenges of the post- Cold War era. Conflicts within rather then among nations. And it's a warning of what can happen if African nations and all of us do too little to stop simmering conflicts before they boil over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The examples of South African Rwanda illustrates why our administration cares so deeply about African affairs and why we have committed ourselves to stronger ties with Africa. We care about Africa because of the great potential of its people., its traditions and its resources. And we care because of the historical ties that bind our two people together. And we care because of the great global challenges of tomorrow are reflected in Africa today</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So for most Americans, Africa is a place of which we care. Who would not? When we read the newspaper account a few days ago of a Rwandan women, separated from her husband and children, waiting in a church for either the next visit of the murderers who were coming from time to time to pluck their next victims from the group she was in, or for her deliverance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But caring is not enough. Care must be translated into conceptual charity, about the nature of the problems that Africa faces, and then care must be translated into practical action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And that begins, unhappily, with the sober appreciation of the limitations that we face and must overcome. Shrinking budgets that will prevent large new infusions of funds. An American people unsure of when or where on earth they want their nation to get involved. A United Nations that is stretched to its capacities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a sometimes overwhelming feeling of pessimism, borne of a decade of African economic decline in African per capita income of about two percent per year. But we are engaged in Africa and we will move forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In support of security on the Continent, we have engaged in active diplomacy to help reserve internal conflicts, including sending presidential special envoys to work on the crises in Angola and in Sudan and in Somalia.  We've supported seven peacekeeping efforts in Africa,, from Mozambique to Liberia, from Angola to Rwanda, giving the people of those nations the breathing space they need to try to rebuild their societies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Somalia, the efforts of the American soldiers and of our relief agencies helped save hundreds of thousands of Somali lives. We're supporting the OAU's conflict resolution mechanism which will identify and address potential conflicts before they explode. We've launched new programs to support the flourishing of democracy on a continent which has seen half its nation's take bold or tentative steps in that direction in the past few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Throughout Africa also, we have left no doubt in the minds of autocratic leaders that we insist on a rapid transition to democracy, return to civilian rule and respect for human rights. To pursue the goal of sustainable development, we're maintaining current levels of development assistance, despite serious cuts in foreign aid budgets elsewhere. We're providing broad relief to African nations burdened by crushing debt, and we intend to do more. We have been steadfast in our support for the wonderful historic change in South Africa through election support and through a post-election package of trade and investment and development policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These efforts are a beginning. But there are opportunities to do more to assist sustainable development, conflict resolution and the promotion of democracy and human rights. We hope that your efforts over the next few days will provide fresh thinking and a deepening public-private partnership that will allow us to seize those opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For their part, the next generation of African leaders faces limitations and challenges that dwarf, of course, our own. But they, too, must look forward beyond the tendency to blame all their problems on the very real legacy of colonial domination. Instead, they must take responsibility for the tough steps that sustainable development and democracy require.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So over the next two days, we will be discussing a wide range of the challenges that African nations are facing and the decisions that the United States faces in conducting its relations with the continent. We will hear from President Clinton, from Vice President Gore and from Secretary Christopher. But most of the hard work, of course, will be done in the conference's six working groups into which you have been divided. And let me take a few minutes, if I may now, to describe those groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first working group will address the issue of sustainable development, and will be chaired by C. Payne Lucas of Africare and Elliott Berg of Developmental Alternatives. The nexus of economic and political and social and environmental challenges facing African can lead on e to a sense of &quot;Afro-pessimism,&quot; as Robert Kaplan has observed in his article, pessimistic enough, &quot;The Coming Anarchy.&quot; This group will consider how we can simultaneously address these challenges and create a synergy that can stimulate development, resurrect societies and build hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A second group, chaired by Richard Joseph of the Carter Center and Pauline Baker of the Aspen Institute, will address the challenge of supporting democracy and promoting human rights. The group will address how the United States can support the revolution of democracy sweeping the Continent on center stage in South Africa, but in quieter and no less dramatic, present also in countries like Malawi and Benin and Niger and Mali.  It will also explore how we can best support the creation of a culture of tolerance, a flowering of civil society and the protection of human dignity throughout the Continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The phenomenon of societies ripping themselves apart from Rwanda and Sudan to Somalia and Liberia is neither new nor unique to Africa. But it has taken on a new urgency in recent years. A third group chaired by Francis Deng of the Brookings Institution and Hank Cohen of the Global Coalition for Africa will consider the proper international response to these crises, including diplomacy, conflict resolution, humanitarian assistance, and peacekeeping. It'll address the roles for the United Nations, for the OAU, for European nations and for our own efforts, and consider ways of the often slow and tortuous, cumbersome international response to these crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A fourth group will address a wide range of global issues facing Africa along, of course, with the rest of the world. These issues range from refugee flows to capacity building for education, from combating crime and corruption to the fight against AIDS. From insuring the full participation of women in society to incorporating modern technology into the life of the Continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vivian Lowery Derryck of the African American Institute and Don McHenry from Georgetown will chair this group, which certainly has its work cut out for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Too often, we think of Africa only in terms of the problems to be overcome rather than the mutual benefits that can be derived. A fifth panel addresses business relationships with Africa, chaired by Percy Wilson of the Corporate Council on Africa, and Stephen Lewis of Carleton College. It will consider how we can expand trade and investment links to Africa, how these links can support African development, and the relationship between our government and the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Central to all of these efforts will be the strengthening of the American constituency for Africa. At a time of renewed interest in Africa, where the exhilaration in South Africa and the horrors in Rwanda I spoke about earlier have produced more front-page stories about Africa than at any time in my memory, it&quot;s incumbent on all of us who care deeply about the Continent to translate this caring and this interest into a tangible commitment. The chairs for this panel will be Charlayne Hunter-Gault of PBS, Ben Chavis of the NAACP, and Michael Clough of the Council on Foreign Relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are all difficult and long-term challenges. And it would be foolish to expect or even to seek consensus from this conference on all of these issues. But the tremendous experience and commitment and intellect of the people in this room, applied exclusively to the African issues for the next two days, is an important milepost in our efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I thank you for your willingness to take time from your very busy schedules to participate in this stage of our national dialogue on the future of Africa and our policies towards Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As we proceed, none of us, I'm sure, will underestimate the magnitude of the problems that confront so many African nations. But again, I urge you not to let the recitation of these problems blind you to Africa's potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anyone who knows the peoples of Africa as well as you knows the particular combination of greatness and power that dwells across their continent. It's the greatness and power that dwells across their continent.  It's the greatness of natural beauty and the power of untapped resources.  It's the greatness of diverse and rich cultures and the power of talented peoples striving for a better future. That greatness, that power, is reflected in Africa's future. That greatness, that power, is reflected in Africa's progress towards democracy and reform, and offers a solid evidence that a brighter African future is much more than a dream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'm now very honored to introduce a message to the conference participants from a man who embodies that brighter future -- the President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela. Thank you. End</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 27, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those of us who were lucky enough to be in South Africa on the morning after Nelson Mandela's inauguration could pick up the &quot;Star&quot; and relive the triumphant moments of that stunning day. The great crowds cheering outside Pretoria's Union Buildings. Mandela and F.W. deKlerk raising their hands together. The delta wing jets that swept over the crowd, with contrails in all the colors of the African flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A day of music, flags, colour and joy,&quot; a headline read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And so it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if you read past the front page and on through the paper, you saw hints of the reality that lies ahead. A story about South Africa's growing number of street children. Little ads from American immigration lawyers promising help to those who want to migrate here or to New Zealand. Letters to the editor complaining about how Zimbabwe treated whites after its independence. Articles about the devastating possibilities of drought for the sugar crop, of when to sell gold stocks -- an sober discussion of the dismal GDP for subSaharan Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the morning after. We had celebrated a triumph. Now the hard work of building a nation began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in many ways, what is true of South Africa is true of the entire continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sweeping through Africa in this last decade of the 20th Century is a wave of optimism. Is it generated by the Mandela inauguration? Not entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After all, I saw other African success stories first hand during my recent trip: Namibia, Benin, and Cape Verde. To meet with the leaders of the Southern African Development Community is to realize that Africa now has eight established democracies -- Senegal, for example, and Botswana. It has 12 new ones, some admittedly fragile. And we see real progress towards democracy in 17 others. The optimism we see is based on far more than the events in Pretoria last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, I remember a conversation with Gwanda Chakuambaphiri, Malawi's Minister of Home Affairs, where he rightly pointed out that support for democracy evaporates if a representative government fails to deliver the goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democracy is only the beginning. Election achievements are meaningless if people continue to suffer under corruption, poor leadership, ethnic hatred and economic failure. And while there are examples of peace, progress and stability -- Botswana, or Namibia -- Africa is worse off now than it was at the beginning of the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Per capita income has dropped drastically. Debt has ballooned. Country after country has sunk into civil was; seven of the 17 U.N. peacekeeping operations are deployed in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of Africa is plagued by disease, whether AIDS for which no country has a cure, or schistomyosis, which can be cured in the industrialized countries for pennies. Nigeria has already lost more than 60% of its forests, savannah and wetlands. Only 15% of Uganda has access to safe water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in Niger, the terrible deforestation means women must walk three times as far through the hot sun for wood to prepare the midday meal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How do we help Africa fulfill the promise held out by the events in South Africa last month?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Administration wants to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In part, our interest in Africa arises out of a vision of foreign policy enunciated by the President during the campaign and much of this year.  It is a three-pronged vision: one that seeks to promote democracy, promote prosperity, and promote our own national security in an age when the Berlin Wall has been dismantled and people are casting ballots in the Kremlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our interest in Africa arises as well, from our passionate belief in the common bond of humanity and from the fact that both this President and Vice President speak for 25 million Americans whose roots are in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Early in this Administration, National Security Advisor Tony Lake emphasized our commitment to support Africa in three key areas, reiterating the President's priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We want to promote trade and investment. We want to leverage capital for basic development and infrastructure. We want to support effective government and democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are those who argue that democracy or free market economies -- or, for that matter, attention to the environment -- are luxuries Africa cannot afford. What patronizing nonsense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democracy is not a cure-all. But if ever there was doubt that Africa is not ready for democracy it was surely dispelled when we saw ordinary men and women waiting in line at the polling places for hours and hours in small townships, rural reserves and great cities along the length and breadth of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And as for those who argue that free-trade will only trample Africa's small companies and smother its entrepreneurs -- well, history shows that when countries choose economic isolation over international economic engagement, their standard of living falls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democracy ... free markets ... attention to the environment. All three conditions, like a kind of economic Petri dish can create conditions allowing environmentally sustainable economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our policy has achieved some notable successes. We have eased the debt burdens of Africa's poorest countries. We have supported democratic transitions. We have influenced the growth of accountable government by conditioning our economic assistance in countries like Zambia and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We expanded the Africa Regional Electoral Assistance Fund to strengthen democratic institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We've continued our support for South Africa's transition to democracy with a $600 million multi-year program designed to meet the urgent needs of South Africans for jobs, housing, health care, basic education and black private sector development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We will continue to work closely in partnership with South Africa to ensure that this historic transition succeeds. In the coming weeks, I expect to announce the establishment of a concrete mechanism to focus our dialogue with Nelson Mandela's government and to maintain high level involvement in helping the South African people realize their dream of a democratic, non-racial, prosperous and free nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American involvement elsewhere in Africa includes leading the international community's humanitarian effort to end the starvation that ravaged Somalia, and supporting its reconciliation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have worked to strengthen the OAU's abilities to resolve conflicts; helped expand the Ecowas peacekeeping presence in Liberia; worked with the international community to advance to OAU-brokered peace accord in Rwanda; provided $94 million in humanitarian aid to Rwanda, Burundi and neighboring states; leased peacekeeping equipment to the U.N., and encouraged regional leaders to revive the Arusha process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our Agency for International Development has undertaken extensive consultations to develop a new approach for doing business in southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AID has reached agreement on regional initiative in four areas -- two of them unlike anything it has done before; a Southern African Enterprise Fund to encourage indigenous private sector development; and a Southern Africa Democracy Fund to strengthen participatory democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Usually, in speeches like these, we try to make news. But this year we have also worked very hard to prevent some headlines from appearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Spring it looked very likely that there would be famine in parts of the Horn region by the end of the growing season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is one of the most pressing problems on the African continent. Who here does not have emblazoned in our mind's eye the images of starving families in Ethiopia in 1984?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This time we did not wait. President Clinton despatched Brian Atwood to the region as his special envoy to coordinate emergency relief efforts and to lead the way focusing development activities on the root causes of famine.  Buy targeting our efforts, along with other donors, on the underlying causes of recurrent famine, we can help break the cycle of despair that now grips much of the Horn region. I'm pleased to state that our efforts have produced results already. We consulted with and gained commitments from the European Union to augment and coordinate food delivery to the region; we energized the United Nations and the PVO community to the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We do not claim to have solved the problem of famine in Africa. Right now there are over 20 million people needing emergency aid in Eastern Africa alone. But this fall, at least, we expect one of those rare times when no news is good news. The real news, of course, is that the world community is reacting quickly to forestall what could have been starvation and death for whole villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I do not run through this list to argue that we have solved problems.  I mention them only to demonstrate the depth of our commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For in the end, American aid ca only be a catalyst. Those who create real change in Africa will be the African people themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that is what we have seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda has emerged from years of chaos and a fairly elected constituent assembly will soon ratify a democratic constitution for that country. Outsiders didn't do that. Ugandans did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malawi prepares for the first genuine elections in three decades.  Outsiders didn't create those elections. The people of Malawi did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Madagascar and the Seychelles recently abandoned socialist rule and have run free and fair elections. Tanzania has legalized opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This wasn't the work of outsiders. It came from the aspirations and persistence and courage of the people of Madagascar, Seychelles and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world-wide telecommunications revolution also holds great promise for Africa. It will spark trade and investment throughout Africa, accelerate the spread of ideas and information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Right now there are 55 phones for every 100 Americans -- and less than 1 for every 100 Africans. Private sector projects such as AT&amp;T's proposed fiber optic seabed cable and the LEOS (Low Earth Orbiting Satellite systems) promise to enrich the lives of all Africans. Meanwhile, Africa can increase its access to information through projects like the GLOBE initiative, which allows school children throughout Africa and the world to work together measuring environmental phenomena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not to argue that Africa is in the homestretch. Democracy has made some progress. But there is so much more to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many African countries need reform in both civil service and in education. In too many African countries, disenfranchised, illiterate populations have been -- and sometimes still are -- the victims of those who won power often through the barrel of a gun and ruthlessly maintained that power. The United States will be frank in its condemnations of those who call themselves leaders, but who continue to prosecute wars in which they risk the lives of hundreds of thousands of their own people -- people who have no voice in their own destinies -- or who, as in Rwanda, butcher those with whom they must live in peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if we in the United States cannot solve Africa's future, we can work with those who have that ability. In fact, we already have. And for evidence, we need look no further than those who are in this room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For looking around, I see Wangari Maathai, the founder of the Greenbelt movement and a champion of rural Kenyan women. I see members of the Congressional Black Caucus which, now under the leadership of Kweisi Mfume, which has made so many Americans aware of African problems and opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I also see Maya Angelou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The night of Nelson Mandela's inauguration, we celebrated in the Market Theatre in Johannesburg, a theatre that was in itself a symbol of hope with its willingness to defy apartheid by the plays it produced. And at one point, Maya Angelou cam to the stage to read her poetry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As I listened -- I was next, and believe me, I didn't relish the idea -- I though of the other time I had stood on a stage and listened to her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was also an inauguration -- President Clinton's, And I remember her poem, which contained these lines:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lift up your eyes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Upon this day breaking for you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Give birth again</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 26 JUNE 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your Excellency the Secretary of State,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your Excellency the National Security Adviser,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Distinguished Members of Congress,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wish to begin by thanking the Administration for extending an invitation to me to attend the White House Conference on Africa and to share with key policy makers of this country our views on the situation in the Continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You will appreciate that, given the magnitude of things in Africa -- its size, diversity, its problems and its potential, I cannot venture to speak in any conclusive terms, about all that is happening in it. We shall have the opportunity during the Conference to discuss these issues further.  What I propose therefore, is briefly to tell you some of the principal problems Africa is facing, what our countries are doing about them and in which areas the United States can assist. In particular, I intend to tell you how far Africa has gone, and what efforts are being expended to deal with the triple challenge of democratization, economic reform and bringing about peace and stability through conflict resolution and the kind of support we think America can bring to these efforts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, one cannot speak of developments in Africa now without beginning with the happy events of South Africa, where a people separated by centuries of racism and bigotry rose to the challenge of peace and have now found common ground in a new democratic country. We celebrate the triumph of reason and justice and of human will as we do the global human solidarity that was forged to oppose the evil of racism. We celebrate the will and determination of people like President Nelson Mandela, whose vision of a society free from racism and in which South Africans of all races and gender can find common belonging. We celebrate the vision of people like Frederick de Klerk, who was willing to initiate the process of change and fought with determination to keep it on course and has now joined efforts in building the new South Africa. We salute them as we urge all South Africans to persist along the course of peace, national reconciliation and unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the dismantling of apartheid and the installation of an elected Government of National Unity in South Africa, the OAU has closed the chapter on decolonization in the continent. Of course, the struggle for decolonization, and especially that against racism in South Africa, enjoyed the support of millions around the world and especially in this country. It was the sustained massive public demonstrations and protests, sit-ins and campaigns of disinvestment in the legislatures and campuses around the United States which pushed the sometimes reluctant administrations to take a definite stand against institutionalized racism in South Africa. Africa is infinitely grateful to those millions, who in selfless commitment to the cause of justice, stood in solidarity with the people of South Africa and kept the faith that ultimately delivered a new and democratic society we now celebrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The people of America and successive administrations of this country were able to support the struggle for justice and against oppression and racism in South Africa because it was simply wrong and constituted an affront to what the United States stands for. And even when political expediency seemed sometimes to weaken American resolve, the collective pressure of the conscience of the people of this country eventually redirected America to the path of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa won in its battle for political freedom and against racism, partly because it had the support of the greater part of the world. We now need the same kind of solidarity if we are to extend the reaches of our freedom to the economic domain to liberate the people of the continent of Africa from the oppression of grinding poverty and economic under-development. The Continent also needs to re-focus its attention to matters of governance, of human rights and of conflicts, which stand to undermine all the efforts at development and peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa is now engaged in the monumental task of democratization. It is not easy. And given the constraints of the socio-economic circumstances in which our countries have to operate, that task is made infinitely difficult.  Yet our countries have not resigned to these difficulties and have instead faced the challenge of bringing greater democracy with courage and determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Increasingly we see governments responding to the demands of the people for accountability and good governance. Governments are likewise converting to popular participation, giving greater political dispensations by which they yield more ground to popular views. The regard to human rights is getting stronger, as governments are being challenged by an increasingly assertive and growing independent media. The regard to the rule of law, accountability and transparency in government are issues which are now taken seriously as agenda for governments. This transition to a new political way of doing business is bringing along with it prospects for a good future, hopes, as well as challenges. And, for all the difficulties this political transition poses, our governments are willing to move with fortitude in the strong conviction that the future of the Continent depends on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa has taken the challenge of democratization seriously even in the face of the myriad of problems it faces. Today in the Continent, more and more countries are converting to political pluralism as multi-party elections have become a frequent occurrence. Five years ago we could count how many African countries had multi-party elections. Today we can count how many do not. This tremendous change has come about in part because of popular demand, but also because governments are increasingly becoming responsive to these demands. It has not been an easy or smooth transition from overwhelmingly single-party political systems and military rules to multi-party politics.  This transition has in some cases brought the political fabric of countries under severe strain, as contrasting and sometimes contradicting interests in society have had to be balanced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The overriding objective in the Continent has been to ensure that even as we undergo transition, we should do so taking into account the material conditions -- especially those of its history, traditions and culture.  Additionally, accent has been placed on the need to safeguard the many social gains which have been achieved over the years, and to ensure that the unity and cohesion in our countries,which have been built at great cost, are not compromised or undermined by that process of transition. To lack care or take this fundamental consideration for granted would in fact undermine the very process of political transition we want to sustain in the Continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the unintended effects of the new political liberalization has been the rise of the ugly spectres of tribalism, ethnicity, religious intolerance and other tendencies of separatism and division. These have equally brought great strain to the social fabric in our countries. The challenge which Africa faces is how to ensure that the genuine identities of religion, ethnicity and tribe are accommodated without allowing the forces of bigotry and all forms of intolerance to exploit that accommodation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You will all appreciate that in a continent as vast and diverse in terms of race, ethnicities, tribes, languages, religions and cultures, tolerance is key to social harmony and stability. Likewise, the challenge we have is to build a culture of tolerance and to use our diversity creatively as a source of strength rather than of division. Naturally, we see the American experience in social accommodation as the most readily adaptable to the African situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We in the Organization of Africa Unity who have had the privilege to be closely associated with this process of political transition through observing elections in many countries, are keenly aware of the problems which the Continent faces. We therefore see strong need to moderate that transition so that the corresponding and necessary adjustments in society which will ultimately sustain that process, are made. When I speak of adjustments, I mean the measures to assure all segments of society, which invariably enjoyed different degrees of political power and influence under the old order, that the change is for the good of all. Principal among these measures is building awareness and instilling in our nations a sense of a new beginning, based on equal rights as well as obligations for everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We need also to impress upon those who may triumph in elections that electoral majority on themselves are not always sufficient to ensure smooth transition to democratic rule. The electoral process and its results, too, need to be measured against the need to create the conditions in which true and effective national leadership can be exercised. Equally, those who lose elections also need to understand that defeat is part of the democratic process and that they can still contribute constructively to the governance of the country, as a responsible opposition. In fact, we need to know how to lose and how to win elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the full internalization of this new outlook will require time and effort as more experience is gathered, there is need to educate for a new political awareness in the Continent. This is an area to which, I believe, the experience and resources of this country can be targeted. Education to build awareness among the electorate on the processes of elections and those of building and consolidating democratic institutions and governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But beyond this process of educating for a new political awareness in the Continent, there is great need for the newly democratizing countries to be supported politically and economically. Invariably most new governments have replaced others which had been in place for decades. These inordinately long periods of rule were at times accompanied by political rigidities and excesses, as well as economic difficulties. All these created a ready opposition which swung to the new political dispensation and supported the new political parties. But now that the new parties have come into power on the ticket of reform, they have to deal with the realities of governance -- of meeting the economic needs of the people, balancing the conflicting political interests in society and maintaining law and order. This is a gigantic task which these new governments have to face without adequate resources. This is all the more compounded by the institution of the needed economic reforms. To democratize at a time when you are carrying out an adjustment program means that you have to find ways by which order can be maintained without resorting to coercion. At the same time, the people who voted these new governments into office are genuinely entitled to expect quick results and a positive change in their livelihood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is why I believe these democratizing countries need to be assisted, particularly in the economic field, so as to sustain and strengthen the process of political transition. Otherwise the strain of poverty will undermine the cause of democracy in the Continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I speak of economic assistance because I am aware of the Herculean efforts being undertaken by the Continent at instituting measures which are designed to halt economic decline and restore productivity growth and development. These have been done, with and sometimes without the support of the international financial and monetary institutions. Africa now realizes that it must take responsibility for the economic mistakes of the past and that to deserve international assistance it must demonstrate that it is doing its best first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For this, African governments are willing to take great political risk and institute unpopular austerity and economic reform measures. These measures have meant less public spending in key social sectors such as health, education, and housing, as well as rolling back the development of much needed infrastructure. The consequences of these reforms, particularly to the very vulnerable segments of society, women and children, have been excruciating. In the spirit of the reforms they have to share cost of health care and education when they literally have no income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Above the squeeze in public spending, the countries have opened up for the private sector, liberalized markets, interest rates and currency regulations. Foreign Investment Promotion programmes have been instituted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All these measures were initiated because they are necessary. At the same time, Africa hoped that the urgings and encouragement it was receiving from the western world to speed up these reforms would have been supplemented by increased resource commitment to support that reform process in the Continent. But neither the western world nor the international monetary and financial institutions have made available the requisite financial support.  Africa is forced to look to the commercial capital market, where it lacks certification and collateral, to raise resources to support the reforms at home. Emphasis in the West and by the financial and monetary institutions seem to be on debt repayment rather on the mobilization of the needed resources to help Africa undertake the reforms which will anchor the continent on sound economic footing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe that the United States should look at the great efforts that the Continent is deploying. People are suffering and governments know. But they also know that they have to persist in these reforms and look to the long term for the benefits. They also know that unless they can mitigate their extreme effects on the people, these reforms are not sustainable and they cannot benefit from indefinite public tolerance. There is, therefore, a symbiotic relationship between the sustenance of both economic and political reforms. And that symbiosis is in resource availability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is why I see the American role in the economic field falling in two broad categories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Firstly, I see a national effort at bilateral level to support the efforts in individual African countries. Through increased resources commitment to the adjustment and restructuring programmes, the United States can help ensure that those programmes are sustained and strengthened.  Equally, I see a role of the United States, especially through its Development Agency, to invest in society targeting, in particular, the rural poor in those sectors vacated by governments as a result of structural adjustment programmes. Investment in clinics and health centres, primary schools and drinking water for example, will help meet society needs at a grass roots level and would be in keeping with the noble mission of the United States Development Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, I see the United States providing leadership at the international level, with the industrialized countries and the monetary and financial institutions in mobilizing support for reforms and development generally in the continent. Apart from the additionality of resources, I see as a clear priority the issue of Africa's indebtedness. I know that many complex monetary and economic arguments and pleas have been put forward to deal with the question of debt. The Toronto Plan, the Trinidad and Tobago Terms and others. But I also know the beyond legal arguments and economic considerations the issue of Africa's external indebtedness is a political one. For the total of Africa's debt is not an amount of any consequence to the debtor countries. All it needs is political will, and experience has shown that in cases where that will exists, economic arguments are set aside.  I therefore hope that the United States will take the necessary political decision to provide leadership and to urge for debt forgiveness in the case of Africa, as a means of liberating the Continent from this albatross as well as of supporting the political and economic transition there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The social problems of the Continent -- high birth rates, low life expectancy, high maternal mortality, the high infection rates of the HIV virus and other killer diseases, chronic malnutrition, the high rate of unemployment, rapid urbanization growth, environmental degradation and many others -- are directly linked to poverty. We cannot, therefore, hope to address any of these comprehensively unless we first aim at poverty elimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Likewise, we cannot hope to promote human rights or pursue matters of good governance unless we address the key issue of poverty which militates against our efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps the most topical of all the problems of Africa are its conflicts. We are witnessing the horror of organized carnage in Rwanda.  Conflicts in Somalia, Angola and Liberia still persist and tensions in Burundi and in other countries present Africa with a formidable challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We know the extent of death, destruction of property and infrastructure, as well as of the damage to social fabric these conflicts have brought about in the Continent. The phenomenon of seven million refugees and fifteen million displaced persons has partly been brought about by these wars and conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1990, in a declaration of the Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the OAU, Africa renewed its commitment to the objective of bringing peace, through the resolution of its conflicts. What was significant about that resolution, was that for the first time Africa said that all conflicts, including those within states, were the concern of every African and that the OAU had a central role to play in the resolution of those conflicts. This new outlook by which Africa freed itself from the limiting interpretations of sovereignty, has been the driving force behind our efforts in the Continent. Since 1990, the OAU has dealt with almost all the conflicts on the continent. The main objective has been to place the instrumentality of the Organization at the service of those in conflicts, and I must add, we have had success in inspiring the confidence of many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to give this new perspective and the efforts of the OAU an operational framework, the leaders of Africa decided last year in Cairo, to set up a Mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution. That Mechanism is built around the Bureau of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government, with the Secretary General and his Secretariat as its operational arm. The Mechanism has a Peace Fund to finance its operational activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the course of the last year, our efforts have been directed at making the Mechanism operational and at applying it to the conflict situations in the Continent. While it is still early to pass full judgment on it, I can confidently say that Africa is on the right course. The Mechanism is an African creation and tailored to the needs and circumstances of the Continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mechanism is an institutional framework for peace and stability, but above all, it is a political statement. It is a manifestation of Africa's new resolve to take the mantle of leadership by situating itself, through the OAU, at the centre of efforts at conflict resolution on the Continent. Africa is saying that charity begins at home, that to get assistance, one must deserve it through example of effort. The countries of Africa are now prepared to get out of the limiting traditional political considerations, such as those of sovereignty and misplaced notions of non-interference, and to embrace each other in a partnership to bring peace and stability on the Continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We in the Organization of African Unity see this as a fundamental transformation, which will prove key to the process of ushering in and consolidating peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is now one year since the establishment of the Mechanism. Of course, during these formative stages we are bound to experience problems, basically those of growing up. Even with the political disposition we see on the part of African countries, there is still some slowness in embracing a new thing. Change of habits built overtime is bound to take time, and we appreciate the difficulties of conversion. With time, and as the Mechanism is applied and internalized, we are bound to overcome the natural fear of the unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already the Mechanism has dealt with a number of conflicts with success. The timely intervention in Congo, for example, helped diffuse the political crisis there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What we may however find difficult, at least in the short run, to overcome, is the central question of resources which are necessary to cover the operations of the Mechanism. We have made budgetary outlay for the OAU Peace Fund, and we hope that African countries will, in some other way share the cost of the operations undertaken within the Mechanism. But even with our efforts, it will still be necessary to mobilize resources from outside the Continent. In this respect, I wish to thank your government for the financial support you have extended to the OAU in our efforts earlier in Rwanda and currently in Burundi and at resolving conflicts generally. As we proved, I hope it will be possible to expand on the cooperation we have had so far in to bring added American support to the Mechanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from this financial support, experience over the last one year, especially with regard to our operations in Burundi and Rwanda, has taught us some lessons. Principal among those lessons, is that Africa needs to wean itself from the dependence syndrome and the mistaken belief that the rest of the world will always be there with its compassion and resources to serve the Continent. The ambivalence of the world, including the United Nations, to take swift and decisive action as hundreds of thousands of people were slaughtered and millions fled into exiles as refugees and displaced persons in Rwanda was an indictment to us all. It was a failure for Africa, the United Nations and humanity at large. But if we put this failure in context, you will appreciate that Africa made the efforts which culminated in agreement to contribute troops to join the United Nations humanitarian effort in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wish to recall that when President Mwinyi of Tanzania, Dr. Boutros Boutros Ghali, the Secretary General of the United Nations and I met with Vice President Al Gore in Pretoria on May 10, just before President Mandela's inauguration, I did point out that several African leaders had on that very day responded to my appeal to contribute troops to UNAMIR's operations. By the time the OAU Summit in Tunis was over ten days ago, more than 4,500 African troops had been committed, ready for deployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To date it has not been possible for the United Nations to deploy these forces because of lack of logistical means. Even at this late hour, I wish to fervently appeal to countries like the United States, to provide without delay, all necessary logistical support to enable the UN to deploy the African troops to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another lesson we have learnt is that Africa needs to be prepared sufficiently to respond swiftly in situations of conflicts. I believe that if Africa had ready forces to draw from, it could have made a difference in terms of troop mobilization for service in Rwanda. This is why I have urged the earmarking of contingents in African national armies, trained in peace observations and peacekeeping, which could be made available for service with the UN or OAU, where circumstances necessitate. I intend to follow up this idea which I had again raised at the Tunis Summit with member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all these, I see the American role being two-fold. Firstly we want America to support our efforts in political terms. As a world leader, America can make a major difference if it supports the OAU politically. A firm endorsement by America in the UN and elsewhere of our efforts would give us the necessary momentum to go ahead. Secondly, provision of added resources, logistically and financially through the Peace Fund, would equally give us the means to operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What we see in Africa is a continent ready to reseize the initiative particularly at finding solutions to its problems. We see in the Continent greater realism and preparedness to depart from established habits of blaming others for its ills and of looking at outsiders for their resolution. Now we take responsibility in the realization that it is Africa which can resolve its own problems even if we shall continue to require outside help. It is this realism and preparedness to assume responsibility that is at the root of the new outlook in the Continent and which holds promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our countries have taken on the challenge of political and economic reforms and of bringing peace to the Continent. Of course we have difficulties, some of them quite serious. Many are man-made but we have to deal with natural disasters such as desertification as well. Of course, when we look at what is happening in Rwanda it is easy to fall prey to the usual stereotyped view that Africa is a continent where suffering and conflicts are endemic and which is condemned to misery and backwardness. But unfortunate as the Rwanda conflict is, it should not be allowed to overshadow the many achievements which Africa has had or the sustained efforts which have been deployed in the area of conflict resolution. Today we celebrate victory in South Africa, we note the peaceful resolution of the Chad-Libya conflict as we do the stabilization of the situation in Congo, and the progress made in Mozambique, Liberia, Somalia and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, we should not lose sight of the great efforts in the Continent at democratization and economic reform and the positive effects these are beginning to have. What the outside world needs to do is to look at Africa objectively and appreciate the great and determined efforts being expended.  It is only if the world sees and knows what Africa is doing that it can render constructive assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why should the United States care about Africa? Because I believe it is in your interest as well. Africa and this country share common bonds of history and culture. In this rapidly shrinking global village, we need global solidarity to sustain cooperation and our interdependence. The problems of Africa concern this country just as Africa is affected by practically every major development in this country. Helping Africa to emerge from its present difficulties is therefore in the long term interest of this country. You need a strong Africa which can be a strong partner in global development and not a subject of your constant compassion and unending charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa is not a continent resigned to fate but one which is determined to emerge from its present difficulties. I hope the Conference will provide opportunity for the participants to look at African closely and beyond the unfortunate negatives which are so often picked on by the detractors of the Continent, to explain away the case of its people. I look forward to being part of that dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAILY OBSERVER, June 28, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gambia Government, in consultation with its development partners, notably the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, decided to table Gamtel's take-over of Radio Gambia on July 1, while &quot;alternative options&quot; are sought for the transformation of the nation's number one radio station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance Minister Bakary B. Dabo, in his Budget Speech last Friday, hinted that there would be a delay in the July 1 hand-over of the radio station to Gamtel, in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force appointed by the President on the matter. Without going into detail, he stressed Government's commitment to the upgrading and modernisation of Radio Gambia, and added: &quot;alternative institutional and other arrangement are being examined by a Task Force whose recommendations will allow Government to take a definitive decision fairly soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Contacted by this newspaper yesterday for clarification, Mr. Dabo said the role of the IMF had been &quot;exaggerated.&quot; &quot;They have indeed expressed an opinion,&quot; he noted, &quot;but the decision is Gambian.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Minister was probably reacting to an article in a local newspaper which last week quoted sources at the Ministry of Information as saying that Radio Gambia's move to Gamtel had been &quot;cancelled at the intervention of the IMF.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These people are our development partners,&quot; explained Minister Dabo, &quot;and in a development like this we consult with them and when they give us their opinion, we study it. But the final decision is The Gambia Government's to make.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Minister assured this newspaper that Government considered the matter &quot;super urgent and important. We know that Radio Gambia is desperate and something needs to be done; but there are too many ways of killing a cat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was asked to confirm information reaching this newspaper that Government had been advised to seek a grant from a friendly nation or nations that would take care of the expenses for the rehabilitation and modernisation of Radio Gambia. All he would say is that &quot;It's not as simple as that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Abdoulie Touray, chief executive of the National Investment Board and chairman of the Task Force whose recommendations the Cabinet approved over tow weeks ago, said that Government had indeed been advised to seek a grant from a friendly nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the grant comes through, it would not be necessary for Gamtel to use its internal resources to fund some of the capital investment for Radio Gambia,&quot; he said. But the telecommunications company would still be called upon to render technical and managerial services toward modernisation of the radio station, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Touray said that based on the Budget Speech, the Task Force would re-convene and look at the alternatives and make further recommendations to Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This newspaper, in an editorial on the subject several months ago, wondered why, if it were simply a question of money, hadn't a grant been obtained long ago. Now it seems that President Jawara, having grown weary of an inefficient national radio, makes a decisive move to do something about the problem -- and more studies are being requested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Information Minister James A. Gaye, under whose Ministry Radio Gambia falls, told this newspaper he had nothing to add to what the Finance Minister had stated in his Budget Speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japanese Grant Approved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the managing director of Gamtel, Bakary Njie, whose corporation received very high marks in the Budget Speech for excellent parastatal performance, told this newspaper that he and Gamtel had been honoured by the invitation of the President to help Radio Gambia out of its crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The challenge at Radio Gambia is not difficult at all,&quot; Mr. Njie told the &quot;Daily Observer&quot; yesterday. &quot;It can be very easily done. With our technical base, which includes an all-Gambian work force and 10 years of experience, we believe Gamtel can offer substantial complementary services to Radio Gambia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Njie welcomed the idea of a grant to help modernise Radio Gambia, and indicated that, in fact, a grant had already been approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told this newspaper that the Japanese government had already expressed its willingness to provide a grant for this purpose, and that it was only a matter of time. &quot;Perhaps the recent changes in the Japanese government have contributed to the delay,&quot; he suggested; but expressed certainty that if the Gambia Government pursued the matter seriously, the Japanese would come through without delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Japanese grant, he said, would cover the cost of a new transmitter, repair of the studio facilities and the development of FM broadcasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gamtel, he explained, would do the initial rehabilitation in anticipation of the Japanese grant. Mr. Njie then gave an outline of the immediate line of action Gamtel would take, if given the opportunity. First, he would re-locate the Radio Gambia transmitter at Bonto, which lies between Yundum and Brikama. &quot;The transmitter is situated at a spot where there is no public electricity,&quot; said Mr. Njie. &quot;They have to depend on a stand-by generator, and the cost of fuel alone is well over three quarters of a million dalasis per year. They have exhausted all their fuel quote,&quot; he added, so they had to switch off the medium wave and use FM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, Gamtel would extend the FM coverage area by increasing the tower height at Mile 7 and link it to the main transmitter. Third, Gamtel would rehabilitate the second transmitter at Bonto, and this would extend medium wave coverage further into the interior.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SUDAN DEMOCRATIC GAZETTE, July 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally last month, the Islamic Fundamentalist military regime of the National Islamic Front (NIF) moved to arrest the former prime minister and leader of the Umma Party, Sadiq El Mahdi. He and three of his lieutenants were charged with plotting to overthrow the regime by force. The three aides, Professor Hamad Baghadi; the former security advisor to the former prime minister, Abdel Rahman Farah, a retired army officer who was an elected member of Mr. El Mahdi's party in the parliament which the present regime dissolved in 1989; and one Said, were detained several months ago without charge. The charge of a plot involving Sadiq El Mahdi seems to have been developed by the regime during the long months of detention of these aides to the former prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Baghadi and Mr. Abdel Rahman Farah were said to have been heavily tortured and the confessions of plotting against the regime, for which the former prime minister has now also been arrested, were obtained under the duress of torture. Their videotaped confessions were relayed on the regime's controlled television just as the security forces moved in to detain El Mahdi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Falsehood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest arrest of Sadiq El Mahdi, which links him to a plot against the regime, must be weighed against the regime's repeated efforts, over the last year in particular, to find faults with which to charge him. This arrest must also be viewed with grave concern for the safety of Sadiq El Mahdi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For at least two years, rumours have circulated within Sudanese circles which indicate that the regime has been seeking a way of legally ending the life of the former prime minister and not just putting him away in prison. The present charge of plotting to overthrow the regime carries with it a maximum sentence of death. Sudanese generally are taking this trumped up charge against the leader of the Umma Party seriously and there are appeals to the international community to do something to save El Mahdi's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would appear that the arrest of the former prime minister, who has recently shown that he had the nerve and the guts to stand up to the regime, shows how desperate the situation has come in Sudan. Sudanese fear that the regime may have finally decided to falsely accuse Mr. El Mahdi because they intend to either kill him while in detention or to put him through one of their Islamic kangaroo courts and then execute him. Such fears cannot be taken lightly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The arrest of Sadiq El Mahdi and his being charged with a serious criminal offence which carries the death penalty, come hardly two months after an ominous comment made by the regime's figurehead military leader.  General Omer Hassan El Beshir was quoted as saying the Sadiq El Mahdi should know that we could get rid of him in a similar way to that used by the former Sudanese dictator, General Jaafar Nimeiri, who got rid of El Sadiq's uncle.  The late Imam El Hadi Abdel Rahman El Mahdi was killed by General Nimeiri's security agents in 1970. The public explanation put out tat the time was that he was shot fleeing the country across the border with Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Predicted Arrest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apparently predicting his arrest, Sadiq El Mahdi made a public statement only hours before the security collected him, refuting all allegations of involvement with any violent plot against the regime. The statement was successfully smuggled out of Sudan as the former prime minister was being arrested and given wide circulation abroad by his party on 21 June, the day following his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his statement, Sadiq El Mahdi recounts the continuous efforts made by the regime to connect him personally and his party with acts of violence, all of which he denies. He said that the Umma Party has what he called &quot;a solemn commitment&quot; to non-violent resistance to the regime. He concluded that even if the Umma Party were to decide to resist the regime and to attain the legitimate democratic objectives of the people of Sudan by other means, these other means would not be as crude and as criminal as the regime wants to accuse him and his party of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 22 June, two days after the former prime minister was arrested, the leadership of the Umma Party abroad held a press conference in London in which they decried the arrest of their leader, called for international public attention to the threat to the life of Sadiq El Mahdi and for an international campaign to free him. Both the secretary general of the Umma Party, Dr. Omer Nur El Daim, and the party's external affairs spokesman, Mubarak El Fadil El Mahdi, recounted the history of their party's relations with the NIF regime and how the regime has tried to implicate their party in each and every plot it says was aimed at overthrowing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turbulent Times</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations between the Umma Party and the regime, which had never been good since the regime overthrew in 1989 the democratically elected government led by the Umma Party, has been particularly bad in 1994. Things were especially tense between the regime and Sadiq El Mahdi personally, because the former prime minister has strongly and openly challenged the legitimacy and the moral and constitutional authority of the regime. On two or three different occasions this year, before they finally locked him up, the former prime minister had engaged the regime in a contest for popular support on the streets of the capital, Khartoum. He won all with flying colours and by many miles ahead. The regime always detained and questioned him briefly after these popular events, but he would be quickly released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is every indication that his arrest this time was premeditated and the pretext deliberately fabricated. Which is why the risk to hi life this time must betaken extremely seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two of his aides, who are being reported by the regime to have confessed to a plot involving the former prime minister, were arrested several months ago. That it took this long for these confessions to be made public by the regime and to have the events around these confessions take such a dramatic turn, attests only too clearly to the regime's own plot against the former prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regime's Plot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The true story of the confessions is, of course, the story of the regime managing over time to extract from the two men false evidence fed to them while under torture. Eventually Professor Hamad Baghadi and Abdel Rahman Farah &quot;admitted&quot; that they and the former prime minister had plotted the assassination of the leaders of the NIF, Dr. Hassan Abdalla El Turabi, Ali Osman Mohamed Taha and others, and the violent overthrow of the regime. When the two accepted to co-operate and made the false confessions, a conversation between the two of them and a security agent, a certain Said, was taped to make the plot seem legitimate. Said, and Umma Party member turned security agent, is supposed to have produced an earlier tape recorded conversation between himself, Professor Baghadi and Abdel Rahman Farah, in which the regime's agent told th tow Umma leaders that he would work with them to assassinate the NIF leaders. Professor Baghadi and Mr. Farah are said to have confessed to having had this conversation on the video tape, which was played on the regime's television the night the former prime minister was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a story which even the supporters of the regime themselves find difficult to believe. For one thing, if a plot like that had existed, and the regime and the evidence which it now says it has, why did they not arrest Sadiq El Mahdi with the other two? The nature and the extent of the regime's own plot against Sadiq El Mahdi indicates that the threat to his life is real and serious.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH, July 4, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For 18 days last April, official of Shell Petroleum Development Company Limited had some serious problems to contend with. The company was losing 158,000 barrels of oil daily as a result of communal disturbances in its operational base in Rivers and Delta states. Crude oil deliveries too were behind schedule because production in 10 communities was halted. And more communities were rising up in protest against the firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company hurriedly commenced negotiations with the aggrieved communities and by May 2 succeeded in restoring production of 100,000 barrels in five oil fields in Delta State. Production in five other fields in Rivers State resume late last month. Still, Shell is losing 28,000 barrels of oil daily form the closure of its five flow stations in the three local government areas that make up Ogoni in Rivers State. The company was forced to abandon production in the area at the peak of hostilities against its operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peace is yet to return to the area and there is no hope production will resume before the end of this year. Emeka Achebe, Shell's general manager, business development, says the company's workers cannot go back to the area unless there is peace and absolute guarantee of their safety.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shell and other oil firms are now paying the price of the years of neglect, marginalisation and environmental degradation of the oil producing communities. Last February, Shell was forced to close down its operation s at Etelebou, Adibawa, Ubie and Enwhe fields and some wells In Kolo creek fields losing 30,000 barrels of oil daily. Production stopped for almost three months. In neighbouring Delta, a wave of demonstrations from April 14 to May 6 brought production in any communities to a halt. It first started in Uzere, April 14 when more than 5,000 demonstrators took over a glow station and two oil fields which had 39 oil wells. April 20, Escravos Beach, Afremo, Saghara and Otumara communities followed by shutting down Shell facilities and holding some staff hostage. The face off cost Shell 100,000 barrels of oil daily of 12 days. The company was forced to notify crude oil lifters of anticipated delays in loading of tankers at the Forcados Terminal, an announcement that pushed up the price of crude oil from $14.65 to $15.25 per barrel in the international market. Oleh and Olomoro communities in Isoko local government also rose up against Shell in May shutting down a flow stations and 25 oil wells. They also seized 18 vehicles belonging to Seismograph Services Limited, a seismic contractor to Shell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The demands of the protesting communities are legion. They include access roads, electricity, potable water, contracts, scholarships, employments and compensation for degradation of their environment. But the cost of the disturbances has been enormous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, Shell lost 141 man-days from 51 incidents in its western division covering Delta, Edo and Ondo states. Losses sustained on the non-utilisation of facilities or down time cost came to $850,000. Besides, its oil production losses were put at 15,17 million barrels. In the eastern division covering Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Imo and Abia states, Shell lost 1,269 man-days and incurred a down-time cost of N250.4 million from 108 incidents.  It could not produce 12 million barrels of oil as a result of communal disturbances. For now, it has increased the number of its security staff from 1,480 in 1990 to 2,470. In effect, security staff constituted 50 percent of its work force in 1993. Still as at April this year, deferred crude oil production in the east alone stood at 6.6 million barrels from 19 incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like Shell, Elf Petroleum Nigeria Limited has been operating in difficult circumstances in Obagi, Ahoada local government area of Rivers State since February. Trouble for the company actually started on October 4 last year when youths from the community ransacked its operational location damaging equipment and disrupting activities for some days. They accused the company of insensitivity to their demands for employment, contract awards and constant water supply. The Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission, OMPADEC, had to step in to resolve the conflict. Peace reigned until February 12 when armed policemen attacked the community ostensibly to recover equipment stolen during the October 4 riot. The attack left a police sergeant dead and many members of the community injured. Elf was forced to shut down its productions of 60,000 barrels of oil daily from the Obagi field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chevron Nigeria Limited, another oil producing firm, also has its own problems. On May 2, indigenes of Opuama in Delta State demonstrated against Shell and Chevron to press for N3.7 billion reparation for damages arising from oil exploration in the area by the two oil companies. After shutting down Shell's on-shore flow station, they headed for Chevron's off-shore oil installations. With 16 boats strung together with cables, they blockaded the installations at Opuekebo. Faced with the threat of a shut down of its facilities, Chevron called in the police to break the blockade. The villagers told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that the police sent in a self-propelled barge which rammed into the blockade sinking all the 16 boats. Three person, Godspower Niki, 27; Hebite Opuba, 48; and Sarah Omoko, 24 drowned while several others were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chevron has a different account of the incident. Bill Edma, Chevron&quot;s managing director, issued a statement claiming that the policemen were sent to tell the people to get out of the way. He claimed the people had complied with the police order without any incident. Tension is still high in the area although Chevron operations are going on with security cover from the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian Agip Oil Company Limited is not left out. Late last year, it suffered disruption of its operations in Brass local government are of Rivers State. The demand of the protesting communities centred on provision of social amenities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from the losses which the oil companies bear as a result of the disturbances, the federation account is also worse off. Oil proceeds form 67.1 percent of the account. At the current oil prices of $17.08 per barrel, Shell lost $48.57 million for the 18 days it could not produce 158,000 barrels of oil daily in April. The federation account which gets 68 percent of oil revenue lost $33.04 million, an equivalent of N727 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from this, some key oil related projects are being held up by the disturbances. Among them is the $500 million gas pipeline meant to supply natural gas to the N30 billion Aluminum Smelter Project at Ikot Abasi in Akwa Ibom State. Disturbances in Ogoniland have prevented the take-off of the project forcing the government to consider tapping gas from other locations since the aluminum plant cannot be commissioned without the gas supply line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of the losses, some of the oil companies are raising the community development budgets. Shell says it is spending $16 million on community development this year in its western division. The package according to Christopher Akinro, the public affairs manager, west, is 2.7 percent of the division's $350 million budget for 1994. The expenditure last year was $10 million. In the eastern division, Stephen Lawson Jack, public affairs manager, east, says the company would spend $22 million on direct community assistance. In addition, a minimum of two percent of production project cost is to be set aside for community development. Last year, the company built six cottage hospitals at N13 million each for oil producing communities in Rivers Sate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On its part, Mobil Producing Nigeria has constructed a link-road between Ibeno and Eket in Akwa Ibom State, provided a hospital and electrified Mkpanak where its tank farm and processing facilities are located. Similarly, Agip built a bridge to link the two sections of Brass community in Rivers State last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some other companies have no recent community development projects to show. Elf which is embattled at Obagi, its main oil field, could not present any project for 1993. For three weeks, the company's public affairs officials in Lagos kept dodging &quot;Newswatch&quot; enquiries on their community development expenditure in 1992 and 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If most oil companies are paying greater attention to the development of local communities, why are they still experiencing communal disturbances in their areas of operation? Thompson Okorotie, a one time legislator and secretary of the Association of Oil Producing Communities of Nigeria, ASOPCON, says it is the expression of resentment of years of neglect of oil producing areas. This position is shared by many Nigerians, including Chidi Amuta, a former university lecturer. Amuta told a national seminar on &quot;Oil Production and Sustainable Economic Development&quot; in Lagos June 15 that a study conducted by the University of Port Harcourt, UNIPORT, has shown that oil communities have the worst poverty level in the country. The areas do not have amenities like roads, water and electricity, a problem compounded by the difficult riverine terrain of the Niger Delta where oil is produced, he explained. With very few schools especially in the interior areas and lack of infrastructure, indigenes of the areas a re disadvantaged educationally and economically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Achebe admits that the fundamental cause of the disturbances is the perception of inequity in the distribution of the nation's wealth especially towards the oil producing areas. &quot;While oil money is used to develop other areas, the people from whose land the oil is take see no development,&quot; an official of another oil company lamented last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even the government acknowledges this fact. Umaru Baba, minister of state for petroleum resources, said in Lagos June 14 that the communities have genuine grievances having waited for so long to derive lasting benefits from the resources being exploited from their areas. Under Nigeria's petroleum laws, the federal government appropriates the rights over oil and gets all revenue from its production without adequate attention to the oil areas in terms of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The oil companies have also contributed to the problem by being insensitive to the plight of their host communities. Before now, they perceived their responsibility as ending with the payment of taxes to the government. That perception only changed in the last three years when disturbances threatened oil production. Paul Asiemo, spokesman for Olomoro community in Delta State, said Shell failed to provide anything beyond a 3-classroom block in the 34 years it had operated in the community. &quot;It was only last year that the company awarded contracts for a six-classroom block and boreholes for the community,&quot; he added. Where the facilities were provided, the companies did not bother about their maintenance. For example, in Obagi, a water scheme built by Elf has stopped working for lack of maintenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1933, the total expenditure on community development projects by all the oil companies was not up to $40 million, less than two percent of their estimated $2.5 billion budget for the year. Don Etiebet, petroleum resources minister, said last March that the extreme disparity in the standard of living in oil workers camp and the host communities equally created tension. This was compounded by the refusal of the companies to extend electricity and potable water enjoyed in such camps to the community.  In Oleh, Lucky Ogba, president of the community, complained that the villagers are not allowed to fetch water provided by Shell and SSL for their workers &quot;even though they pollute our own source of water supply without an alternative provision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil companies also delay the payment of compensation for damages to communal and individual property, a problem Shell says it wants to solve by setting a target or 35 days as maximum period for the settlement of claims.  Under the Land Uses Act, the land belongs to the state government and not the individual or the community. This makes it possible for oil firms to pay the communities for only structure and crops already on the ground while rent goes to the state government. According to the rates worked out by government, an hectare of farmland would attract a compensation of less than N10,000 and the farmer loses his rights over the land forever. Although, some of the oil companies like Shell have abandoned the government rates to pay at least N100,000 per hectare according to Lawson Jack, others are still hiding under the law to pay the ridiculous rates. The complex procedures for getting the compensation has compelled some of the communities to hire claim agents who take away up to a third of the amount. Lawson Jack said the agents are unnecessary in the case of Shell. For most other companies, the communities complain that they make little headway without the agents who can &quot;settle&quot; officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from these problems most of the oil companies have refused to employ indigenes of the oil areas. Unemployed youths are now responsible for most of the disturbances. &quot;They have hijacked leadership from the elders who have failed to deliver over the years,&quot; an oil company official said last week. The change in leadership is now making community relations management difficult for the companies. &quot;The elders were easier to deal with,&quot; the official added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the root of the current spate of disturbances is the question of responsibility for developing the oil areas. To Achebe, the primary responsibility is that of the government. He said, &quot;Our role should be secondary. If Shell takes over the provision of social services, it would end up running a parallel government which is not healthy.&quot; Marshal Harry, managing director of Harrison Oil, argues that &quot;whosoever is collecting the oil money should be the person with responsibility to develop the areas. All of them, government and the oil companies have a collective responsibility.&quot; Okorotie shares his position saying &quot;the oil companies have something at stake too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By last week, the oil companies were exploring options for handling the crisis before it gets out of hand. &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt that a joint submission by all the companies to the Emmanuel Abisoye panel probing the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation warned of the dangers of continued neglect of the oil areas. They called for quick action by the government on issues fueling the disturbances. As Paul Ogboman, an indigence of Ogbia in Rivers State, said last week, if the neglect and degradation are not promptly addressed, the current spate of disturbances may be &quot;a mere dress rehearsal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH,July 11, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Umaru Dikko, Nigeria's most celebrated political exile and transport minister in the Shehu Shagari administration, returned to Nigeria June 26.  He has spent ten-and-a-half years in self-exile in Britain, where, in 1984, he was kidnapped, drugged, chained, and crated to be forcibly flown to Nigeria in a Nigerian Airways cargo plane.  The kidnap was foiled by British anti-terrorist police at Stansted Airport in the outskirts of London.  He is now a nominated member in the Constitutional Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: You are returning to Nigeria after more the ten years of self-exile in London.  How do you feel now that you are going back home freely?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dikko: Well I have always felt that in the end God will ensure that justice is done.  I have never lost hope that one day I will again participate in the affairs of my country.  Maybe you recall in one of my several interviews with you, I said even though I cannot have access to God's own computer but I believe I have still some programmes in it.  Because if the program was finished I would have perished in that crate.  I feel thankful to God that He has given me another opportunity.  If I had been bad in His sight, He wouldn't give me another opportunity.  So, to me, this is my vindication.  And I am ready- I have always said it- I am happy, I am ready, whenever my country requires my services, I will offer those services in the best way that I can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: Emotionally, how are you feeling?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dikko: I don't feel very much emotional.  I just feel it is something that has to come.  As I said, it did not take me by surprise, because I knew that there is still a programme in God's computer as far as I am concerned.  So, all I can say is that I am glad that His will be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: How did your nomination to the constitutional conference come about?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dikko: It must have been by the design of the chief designer- that is God.  So, to me, it has come the way it has come, it is what I hoped would come.  Not that I have been expecting to be included as a member of the constitutional conference.  What I am saying is that I have all along expected that one day, God will make it possible for me to show up again in Nigeria, and to carry on with the work that I have been doing, which, even though condemned by some, it has now been proved it has not been condemned by God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: Have you noticed the irony?  The same people who declared you wanted, sponsored your kidnap, crated you, and sought your extradition, are the ones now giving you a hero's welcome back to Nigeria as a member of the constitutional conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dikko: Yes.  It is now all hands on deck.  They say, &quot;when the going becomes tough, it's then the tough gets going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: Many people are still surprised that you are included in the constitutional conference.  Who initiated the move to include your name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dikko: It is a pleasant surprise.  From the day I was told in conversation by some friends locally here (London) that Nigeria would be looking for their best to participate in the conference; I said, &quot;well, if I am not the best, I cannot be the worst.&quot; So, therefore, there is a chance, right?  So, I thought that somehow, somewhere, at a certain level, one may feature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: What is your own opinion on the constitutional conference?  Haven't we had enough constitution-making conferences in Nigeria?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dikko: I think it is a good thing in the sense that so much water has passed under the bridge, and there is so much more controversy over the last eight, nine years.  There have been so many changes, I think it is time we look into the fundamentals and discuss issues openly, frankly, fairly, boldly, courageously, so that once we've found a solution, it would be a stable solution.  I don't want any make-shift solutions.  As you know I have been out of Nigerian politics within the boundaries of Nigeria over the last ten years.  Now that I am going back; we'll pick up where we left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: What are these fundamentals and issues which you think the conference must seriously discuss?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dikko: Well, in my view, the first and the most important is for the conference to diagnose what has been wrong with Nigeria.  Why is that problems always crop up?  Why is it we are unable so far, from the day we got independence to this day, to find a permanent solution to our problems?  Why do we walk and fall walk and fall, walk and fall?  The conference must find out why we don't have stability, politically.  We must find out why.  Is it due to the selfishness of the elites?  Or do the masses have any role to play in it?  We must find out.  We must really go deep and identify, because if their is a disease and you don't identify the causes then it becomes difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: From your experience, what really is the problem with those who lead us in Nigeria?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dikko: Not many people are willing to work for the country.  Most people look at public life in terms of personal benefit, a way of earning a living.  This, I think, is one of the real problems facing us.  We don't have people with vision, people that lay claim to leadership, they are of very limited vision, and also, of very limited exposure internationally, that is our problem.  Therefore, the world is moving on very easy, and if you don't move with the correct speed, you are bound to be left behind, and if you are left behind, all the mess that is thrown out by the fast moving planet will fall on you.  I believe it is high time we try to identify those with the correct vision, so our country can be led into a future that is bright.  We have got a country with tremendous potentials but because of our political technicians do not see far we always have problems.  We say we want democracy and yet we don't even want to except the rules of democracy.  If there is an election, as soon as I am the winner, we will shout it is rigging.  As soon as you are the winner it is rigging.  If you've got two opposing parties, or, two rivals in an competition, if one is victorious, the other has to accept it, and vice-versa; but we don't seem to do that.  That is one of the areas where I think there is something fundamentally wrong.  That is why I said regard this conference as more then discussing the legal terminologies such as there shall be one president, there shall be this and that; this is more then that, the way I see it.  And I want to face it from that angle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: Can the country still remain one?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dikko: I believe it can, but we have got to work out the modus operandi, because to remain one, it must be to remain sensibly one, and to remain usefully one, and to be determined that by remaining as one, we are going to make progress.  This is important.  All along we have not sat down to discuss what should be what and who should be where.  I think this time we should do so.  All these cries of domination, political domination, economic domination, religious domination, all these things we must not fear to discuss them and to negotiate how the country should be run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: Who should decide whether the country should remain one or not, is it a handful of people in the constitutional conference, or, the people of Nigeria themselves in a national referendum which some have called for?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dikko: First of all I am only saying my own views, I don't know what is on the agenda.  Maybe what I am saying may not be on the agenda, but at least that would be my view.  Now, left to me, I will say put it to a referendum.  Once it is put into a referendum and the country decides, then no local politician can come out with different views.  That's the point.  Put it to a referendum, let the ordinary man say which way he wants, and then whoever you are, whether you are a delegate, elected or nominated, you know you have to operate within the framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch: But how do we get out of the June 12 albatross that is hanging over the nation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dikko: Well, June 12 of 19- what?  Of 1994 or 1993?  If you are talking of June 12, 1993 dilemma, I think those who are prolonging the dilemma are doing so in an exercise to be heard.  They wish to remain in the limelight and that is why they carry on.  If you have got only one topic, you keep on talking about it so people can hear your voice.  I think that we have got so many topics in Nigeria and people should just forget about June 12.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, June 28 - July 1, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another public tongue-lashing similar to the recent Uganda Airlines Corporation and Gulf Air affair, President Museveni may again not have been told the whole truth in the controversy surrounding the management of a US$3.1 million UNDP-funded Tree Seed Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a press conference on June 6 after his return from a European tour, Museveni criticised the way the project was being handled. &quot;They have removed the money from the ministry (Natural Resources) to a non-existent unit in a corner...&quot;, he said. He promised to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with &quot;The Monitor&quot; at his office last Thursday, the Vice President, Dr. Sam Kisekka admitted advising the President on National Execution Unit's (NEX) controversial role in the seed project.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without mincing words, the VP said NEX was formed to tap money from government project, employing people who wanted to net a lot of money after resigning from government. He said he briefed the President after detecting a lot of loopholes in the operation of NEX.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two year long controversy of the stalled project in which the Vice President was drawn, began with complaints by the Natural Resource Minister, Henry Kajura seeking management of the project without the involvement of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Henry Kajura had written to the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning complaining that the project had stalled due to NEX's interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Vice President intervened in June last year by writing to the Minister of Finance &amp; Economic Planning expressing his concern over the interference of NEX which he called an &quot;illegal&quot; unit in the Ministry of Finance. He said its activities had never been discussed in cabinet, especially whether its formation and modalities were acceptable to all ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the VP's intervention instead fuelled bickerings over the project.  The Ministry of Finance insists that on May 3, 1990, the Minister of State for Finance &amp; Economic Planning, Matthew Rukikaire, communicated to all ministers and copied the letter to all permanent secretaries, the three Deputy Premiers about the formation of NEX. The functions of NEX were explicitly outlined to include monitoring, executing and overseeing on behalf of government all United Nations supported projects. And to streamline accountability of UNDP funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Unit's organisational chart falls under External Aid Coordination Department. Under the agreement of the Tree Seed Project a national and three regional centres would be set up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This explanation however was not bought by those opposed to any interference in the project. The first scathing attack came from the Assistant Commissioner Forestry who is also Seed Project Manager, (also said to be wife to the then Personal Assistant to the Vice-President Nyanja Musoke) Mrs. Racheal Musoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In her correspondences, she alleged that NEX was a one man organisation formed by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance &amp; Economic Planning, Tumusime Mutebile, which had ignored Desk Officers in the implementing line of the Ministry of Natural Resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To this Mutebile agrees that an error of omission in the letters of agreement had been made. Because under the agreement, the Department of Forestry was erroneously accorded the executing status when by virtue of its technical nature it is supposed to be merely implementing. Mutebile wrote to the UNDP indicating that there was need to amend the letters of agreement for the Tree Seed Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview last week, the UNDP Resident Representative and Co-ordinator of all UN operational activities in Uganda, Tedla Teshome, said NEX is legal and operating under procedures accepted by both government and UNDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the controversy which surrounds the Tree Seed Project is an internal problem brought about by officials in the department of Forestry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that UNDP was happy with the performance of NEX because it controls and makes assessments on projects' progress. UNDP represents the project donor, United Nations Sudano Sahelian Office (UNSO) in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Vice-President would not buy any of that. On May 16, 1994 he wrote to the Director of OPS (Office for Project) in New York requesting the head office's intervention. He protested the ways in which UNDP Kampala and NEX were handling the affairs of the Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kisekka accused the Kampala UNDP office of conniving with NEX to terminate the services of the project's Chief Technical Adviser, James Kilpatrick</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He warned that government was taking a very serious view of the attempt by the UNDP office in Kampala to &quot;run a government within government.&quot; He also asked them to rectify the situation &quot;for future smooth running of various programmes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He rubbished the argument that NEX was formed in May, 1990 and known to all ministers. He reasoned that if the Unit had been operating at that time (1990), then the letters of agreement which were signed in 1991, would have stated NEX as the executing agent but not the Forestry Department which is fighting to control the project funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I cannot rule out the fact that UNDP Kampala colluded with NEX to misappropriate the project money. Well they would like to exonerate themselves through the press but have not done the right thing,&quot; he said. He said the decent desert was advancing but that the expatriate (James Kilpatrick) who was working on the project had been laid off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Monitor&quot; has learnt that Teshome, disturbed by the CP's harsh language over the matter and believing that both the president and the CP have been insufficiently informed, has been trying to get the facts to the two. But going by the CP's response last week, the conflict seems to be still far from being resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Responding to accusations levelled against NEX, its head Wesles Nyabongo, in an interview last Thursday decried the poor level of concern the Minister of Natural Resources and the Vice President had over the Unit. He said by an Act of Parliament, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning is empowered to enter in any contract on behalf of government but not any ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said it was absurd that the Vice President and Minister Kajura were the only officials who claimed not knowing about the existence of NEX, when over 80 UN Projects are executed by the Unit on behalf of government. He said that the calibre of manpower at the Unit equalled the expatriates level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;NEX has a long term strategy of eliminating the expatriate component on UN funded projects. In fact government should be proud of our performance instead of calling us an illegal Unit,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting to the termination of Kilpatrick&quot;s services, Nyabongo said he performed below expectation and that was the reason why UNDP which handles all OPS and UNSO projects declined to renew his contract which expires in May this year. Kilpatrick failed to submit a project plan after working on the project for a year. And that it was the DANIDA Seed Centre staff who assisted him prepare one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NEX boss said he had a problem of receiving accounts of the project from the Project Manager, Racheal Musoke, because for two years nothing was going on. &quot;Except of course she was making budgetary revisions and requesting more money for no work done,&quot; he alleged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, June 14-17 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The arrival of Marlboro on the Ugandan tobacco scene is stirring up controversy with allegations the Trade and Industry minister, Richard Kaijuka, is personally &quot;eating&quot; from the palms of Philip Morris -- the American multinational making Marlboros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The arrival of Philip Morris broke a decade-long monopoly by British American Tobacco (BAT) Uganda Ltd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A BAT mid-May press statement said they did not object to competition from any company joining the Uganda market, as long as it was fair and honest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are however those who claim there is something fishy about this Marlboro affair. There are claims that Kaijuka, who signed the agreement that gave Marlboro a slot on the Ugandan scene and NRM Vice Chairman, Haji Moses Kigongo have a vested interest -- considering their assumed links with Translink (U) Ltd., the marketing agents of Marlboro. It is said that Kaijuka and Kigongo pushed for Marlboro only, as opposed to a general opening of the market to all cigarette makers because they hoped to make money out of the deal which only allows for a duopoly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And that is not all. There are those who will swear that Kaijuka has a grudge against BAT and is determined to kill it using his positions Minister of Trade and Industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mr. Phakrar Makesh, Translink (U) Ltd. boos, refuted the allegations. So did Kaijuka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaijuka says that the government has &quot;liberalised the entire tobacco industry&quot; from the production and marketing of the tobacco leaf to importation of cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He explained that the government has started having problems with the tobacco industry. &quot;That is why we liberalised it. BAT was, allegedly, not buying all the tobacco grown by the farmers causing a surplus menace in many tobacco growing areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was mainly because of the glut on the international market for the leaf. &quot;BAT was therefore buying from only the contract farmers, while other farmers were left out,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that farmers had also began having doubts about BAT being the only buyer of their crop. &quot;Some felt they were not getting a fair price for their crop, and that if there were other buyers, it would perhaps improve their opportunities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that there were also problems with classification, so tobacco farmers with grades BAT didn't want were left in the cold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaijuka says government will now allow in any company as long as it has the capacity to buy the surplus tobacco that BAT may not have purchased; and as long as it has the capacity to help Uganda grow appropriate varieties of tobacco and can assist in marketing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Even today any company can come in as long as it can help us to solve those problems,&quot; Kaijuka said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that government has still protected BAT by imposing an import duty for all the new companies in addition to all the other taxes paid by BAT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Kaijuka any newcomers must first deal with the surplus of tobacco before they can start growing, and they must go to new areas and new farmers, not those already developed by BAT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that this was a cabinet decision, and not his alone. In any case, he said, he has never done business with Kigongo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaijuka also said that a number of other companies have asked to be allowed into the Uganda market but some are not willing to undertake those conditions. &quot;Philip Morris have promised to undertake these responsibilities, that's why we let them in,&quot; Kaijuka said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Makesh said that whichever conditions have been imposed on Philip Morris will be honoured, although this can't be done overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The infrastructure in Uganda has been developed by BAT, so we have to put parallel infrastructure before we can begin growing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Makesh added, &quot;BAT has been producing its own tobacco. So Philip Morris can't just buy BAT tobacco unless it is clear it has failed to buy,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But BAT Assistant Public Relations Manager, Jimmy Kiberu, said that BAT buys all the usable tobacco and it is very unlikely for any other company to buy tobacco rejected by BAT because it is usually of poor quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another BAT official said that tobacco growing is a very expensive and cumbersome affair only a committed company would undertake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the Philip Morris is essentially a manufacturing company which buys tobacco leaf from tobacco merchants like Universal Leaf (an American Company), and Standard Commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Uganda would be a rare exception if Philip Morris suddenly decided to go into growing,&quot; the official mused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said BAT has 300 extension workers upcountry, and spends about Shs.  3bn every season on extension services (which includes planting techniques and advice on how to use fertilisers).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worse still, prices for the tobacco leaf have registered a 20 percent drop in the last two years, which makes growing tobacco very risky and unprofitable. For instance. a BAT mid-May press statement said that Zimbabwe had reduced its tobacco crop from 230 million Kgs last season to 165 million this season. The statement said the BAT made a loss on the export side of its business last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, July 1-5, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behind the noisy scenes in the Constituent Assembly, there is a plan which is brewing to turn it into a transitional parliament -- and government under President Yoweri Museveni -- after the NRM's extension expires January 26, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to information available to &quot;The Monitor&quot;, a power-sharing deal for a transitional government is being brokered behind the CA curtains as a compromise for both multi-partyists and movement advocates. This would come into effect when the NRM's five year extension expires January 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The behind the scene manoeuvers, are producing strange bed fellows, and deals are being cut around some critical issues over which the delegates are sharply divided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The type of government is obviously the biggest bone of contention, and &quot;Movement&quot; politicians argue -- as they have done for the last eight years -- that the political parties need time to &quot;re-organise.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outnumbered and outplayed, several multi-party delegates are said to be arguing that a snap election in 1995 would give NRM as easy election win, something everyone fears might brew trouble. But in making that argument, they will be able to eat their cake and have it at the same time. They could &quot;eat&quot; something from supporting an extension of NRM rule in more respectable form in the transitional government, and yet appear to their electorate to have supported multi-partyism in principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the Movement system -- or the NRM -- be given five more years in its present form, which has until now seemed a credible idea, is withering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most critics say in NRM got another lease of power through any kind of arrangement other than a REAL general election, they would appear like political crooks who have stayed longer than their welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides, many delegates towing this line argue that due to logistical mountains, it is impossible to hold an election in January 1995 when the NRM's mandate expires</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CA Commissioner Stephen Akabway's Election Evaluation Workshop held in Mbarara in May seemed to work in favour of this view when it recommended that given the many hurdles conservative estimates of the time required to adequately prepare general elections is ten to twelve months from the.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cheap alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea of transforming the CA into a &quot;transitional parliament&quot; and President Museveni into a transitional leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the President be directed to transform the National Resistance Army (NRA) into a NATIONAL ARMY, and change the widespread view that it is his &quot;army.&quot; The proposed national army be recruited through a quota system for each of Uganda's 39 districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The political parties would also sort out their houses and together with CA delegates, nominate ministers who would then form a transitional government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact some members of UPC, though they scorned the CA elections and officially say they will not recognise whatever comes out of it, are said to be already negotiating for some slots in the transitional government!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is this government that would steer the country into general elections. All in the magical year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Very convenient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni gets the best part of the beef in this scheme. He is looked at as the man who should lead the transitional government, since he is the one who &quot;initiated the democratisation process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group pushing for the transitional arrangement is said to be vehemently opposed to a power-sharing deal with the National Resistance Council (NRC) which they accuse of having botched up the 1989 extension. They say the CA is more credible if transformed into a legislature because it was largely elected on universal adult suffrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also believe that even if it comes to push and shove, they would still manage to push a vote through the NRC to amend the Law and accommodate any new arrangement. Not surprisingly, the NRC is struggling to gain credibility. In an unprecedented move which was seen as a vote of no-confidence in government, it trashed President Museveni's Communication from the Chair statement to parliament, which was full of rosy claims on the economy but had no new ideas to help the growing army of the poor. The CMs always knew that these claims about the wonders of the economy were a world apart from reality, but had never had the guts to say so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only problems for this transitional scheme seems to stem form the kind of trade-offs that have to come into play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Federalism is one issue which will simply not die, for instance; the line which was mooted by the Buganda Lukiiko was that all the nationalities (tribes) in Uganda should go their separate ways in administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lukiiko argues that federalism is the only way Ugandans can live together without pointing tribalistic fingers at each other, and is the only way to end the robbery of the rest of the country to fill the stomachs of the tribe in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Baganda delegates believe they have a good chance of getting their way on this, and are also reported to have changed tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CA delegates from Buganda have told &quot;The Monitor&quot; of talks about giving the platform to delegates from areas other than Buganda to push for &quot;federo&quot; so that it is not seen as merely a local Buganda issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many NRM politicians loathe federalism because they think it is shorthand for the rest of Ugandans being chased out of Buganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if the buoyant mood that existed during the coronation of King Ronald Mutebi last July is anything to go by, the Buganda are not going to let this thing go without one hell of a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would be suicidal for government to forget that it was party to whipping up expectations which must be met at least half way. &quot;The Monitor&quot; has learnt that the NRM is trying to find a solution to this question in &quot;federo&quot; based on regions. This arrangement is aimed at mostly benefiting and appeasing Buganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The raw nerves over federalism were exposed just days ago, when Minister of Justice and Attorney General Abu Mayanja, CA delegate for Busujju made an outrageous remark regarding kingship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the children's CA mock debate two weeks ago decided that monarchies be banned, Abu rather recklessly (though some people say he was only joking) said that &quot;those who do not want kingdoms should leave the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Wednesday Abu was reported in a &quot;New Vision&quot; lead story to have cautioned non-Baganda living in Buganda to desist from any attempt to oppose full restoration of monarchism in the region. He is reported to have said that monarchism would be fully resorted whether the &quot;aliens&quot; like it or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He drew a lot of flak for the remarks and even had to call a press conference Wednesday to clear the air. &quot;There are differences (in the Ugandan communities) and it is a mistake to pretend that they are not there,&quot; he said, though he conceded that the statement after the kinds&quot; debate was unguarded. A source who was tat the occasion in Njeru where Abu spoke claims that &quot;The New Vision&quot; only reported the tip of the iceberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mayanja's pleas that his remark was unguarded was not known in the CA where he was attacked viciously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof. Apollo Nsibambi, who also got carried away after the children's mock debate, on his part told &quot;The Monitor&quot; Wednesday that the issue of federalism is falsely equated with monarchism yet the two are different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Bugandanising the issue is a way of dismarketing it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Federalism is a national issue not a Buganda issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About the trade-offs in the house, the professor admitted there was a lot of bargaining in the CA corridors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But there is no war in the CA. We have a more informal and detailed form of bargaining where people are much more amicable,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He dismissed the alleged trade-off between pluralists and &quot;Buganda federo&quot; saying the two are separate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nsibambi also dismissed the idea of a transitional government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't think a transitional government is necessary because after the CA we shall have elections. We are now ready to have a fully elected government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omara Atubo however told &quot;The Monitor&quot; the same day that a participatory position would be the moderate position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Parties don't think they are participating in terms of policy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On federalism, Atubo said it is complicated by the tendency to equate federalism with the supremacy of the Kabaka in Buganda, which may be seen to threaten the unity of Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said a short term alliance will not help the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we believe Uganda is ready for federalism let's go for it. If we believe it needs pluralism let's go for it,&quot; Atubo argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact the spirit of consensus that many delegates like referring to platitudinously, is also threatened by a reported split between delegates who are also NRC members -- now called veterans and the fresh delegates -- called virgins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The virgins have already started charging that the veterans are trying to marginalise them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An unhappy virgin delegate who talked on condition of anonymity to &quot;The Monitor&quot; complained that even the four committees that have just been instituted are all led by veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rules and Orders Committee Chairmanship went to Omara Atubo with Brigadier Jim Muhwezi acting as deputy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Privileges, Discipline &amp; Welfare Committee went to Brig. (Retired) Moses Ali who emerged man of the week after clinching FUFA chairmanship.  Hajati Janet Mukwaya is his deputy, while the Business Committee, the biggest of them all, will be chaired by Stephen Kavuma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sharp-tongued George Kanyeihamba ate Chairmanship for Legal &amp; Drafting Committee with Ben Wacha being his deputy. This especially is reported to have witnessed a big battle with the virgins pushing for Dani Nabudere. It is only an alleged deal between the NRM and UPC that Kanyeihamba cam in on the NRM ticket, while Wacha on the UPC ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most delegates from Northern Uganda, especially the pluralists, are also said to be bidding their time and not talking, to &quot;avoid being sized up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the NRM is said to be playing their cards tight. Many CA delegates believe that already cars for the delegates have entered the country but will only be given out &quot;when Museveni thinks the time is ripe!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And of course, everyone wants to eat, whether a car, ministry or some parastatal job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an assembly which in public is said to be split over everything from petty details like whether delegates need cars, how much they should earn, whether to be called Distinguished of Honourable Delegate or something else, to big issue of land, citizenship and the big one -- the Movement, buying them might be the best way to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a divided House that one. But that is not say there is no &quot;glue&quot; which will bring them together. The question is, what will that glue be?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Storrs, Connecticut</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> July 21, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Moshood Abiola of Nigeria -- businessman, philanthropist, and pro-democracy leader -- will receive the degree of honorary doctor of letters from the University of Connecticut for his commitment to democracy and his outstanding philanthropy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Abiola, one of Africa's leading businessmen and philanthropists, won a majority of votes in the June 12, 1994 democratic election in Nigeria.  However, the results were annulled by the military government and Abiola is presently under arrest. Nigeria's oil workers, civil servants, teachers, physicians, and association of lawyers are now on strike in an effort to persuade the military government to respect last year's election results.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The University will award the honorary degree to Abiola at its Convocation ceremony August 31 or at Commencement in May 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In a continent plagued by crises, Chief Abiola has become a powerful symbol of the hopes and aspirations of African peoples around the world,&quot; says Amii Omara-Otunnu, director of the University's Center for Contemporary African Studies, who nominated Abiola for the honorary degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria, an oil-producing country, is more than twice the size of California and has the largest population of any African nation. It is the historical homeland of many African-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola was born in 1937 in Ogun State, Nigeria. Now a millionaire, from age nine he got up before dawn to collect firewood which he sold to pay his school fees. Later he supported himself through performing as a musician at weddings and funeral ceremonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trained as an accountant at the University of Glasgow, Scotland, he was graduated in 1966 with highest distinction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He quickly worked his way up from head of finance and accounts at Lagos University Teaching Hospital and the University of Lagos Medical School, to regional controller of Pfizer Products of Nigeria and Ghana, to managing director and chief executive officer of ITT for Africa and the Middle East. He was the first Nigerian to head a multinational corporation in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1991, he served as president of the Nigerian Stock Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His business enterprises include founding and managing the Concord Press of Nigeria, which publishes the &quot;African Concord&quot; a weekly which covers socio- political news from the Cape to Cairo and is distributed in 81 countries across six continents, and the &quot;Africa Economic Digest,&quot; a round-up of business and economic news from all over Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A staunch champion of the freedom of the press, Abiola was arrested on several occasions during the 1980s for the independent stance of the Concord Press, says Omara-Otunnu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Chief Abiola has a record of standing firm for his principles, even at risk to his personal safety,&quot; says Omara-Otunnu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When devaluation of the Nigerian currency during the 1980s put textbooks out of reach for many Nigerians, Abiola formed Abiola Bookshops to provide educational textbooks and supplies, and initiated a National Commercial Printing Association to enhance local production of books, Omara-Otunnu says. In 1989 Chief Abiola, a practicing Muslim, gained permission to produce both the Koran and the Bible in Nigeria, making nearly 12 million copies available, he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concerned about the food crisis in Africa after a visit to drought-stricken Ethiopia, in 1984 he founded Abiola Farms Ltd., which produces more than 4,000 tons of grain and 1,400 tons of soy beans annually and serves as a national model for agricultural production. He also established a bakery which produces more than 500,000 loaves of bread a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Chief Abiola's career is distinguished and inspiring,&quot; says Omara-Otunnu. &quot;Through sheer hard work in the academic and business worlds, he overcame abject poverty to become a millionaire.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He has committed his wealth to endow philanthropic causes across ethnic, religious, and national lines,&quot; adds Omara-Otunnu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A patron of both the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus and the Black Parliamentary Caucus of Great Britain, Abiola's distinctions include the 1990 Congressional Black Caucus Chairman's Award for Exemplary Service to the International Community and the African Diaspora and the 1987 National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons (NAACP) Black Heritage Award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the U.S., he has endowed Alabama's Tuskegee University with 25 scholarships in honor of 25 African and African-American leaders of the Pan-African movement, and he has awarded fellowships in African studies and applied sciences at both Tuskegee and Howard Universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Africa, Abiola is the principal patron of the W.E.B. Debois Foundation and the Kwame Nkrumah Foundation, public research foundations named after two champions of the common interests of black people worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is a patron of several projects of the African Studies program in Nairobi in which 29 African countries participate and he regularly donates books on African affairs to African university, including those in French and Portuguese-speaking countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola has established a six-year high school for 2,000 students in his home state of Ogun, made substantial personal contributions to more than 200 community grammar schools throughout Nigeria, and established 194 Islamic centers to provide free Koranic education to Muslim children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holder of many African honorific tittles, Abiola was awarded the title of Bashorun, or chief, buy the Ooni, or king, of Ife in Yorubaland, a distinction equivalent in Nigeria to being knighted in Britain. End</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maxixe, Mozambique</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> July 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carol Gilley, an American working in Mozambique, is supported by the United Church of Christ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dear friends,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Veronica Mazive is a special friend of mine. Her husband Chadreque is the pastor of the Congregational Church at Morrumbene, a small town north of Maxixe. In 1992 Chadreque and Veronica came every week for English lessons and stayed overnight with us. In 1993 Veronica came to the Bible school in order to become better equipped to lead women's groups in the church. In March, 1994 we traveled to Zimbabwe together to see work begin done for and by women in our churches there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Veronica goes home to Morrumbene each weekend, and one weekend she invited me to accompany her. We left Balaza Friday noon, walking the two kilometers to the National Road #1. Both of us had a small bag of personal belongings, but in addition Veronica carried a 25 kilogram bag of maize on her head. We waited by the road for about an hour before a &quot;taxi&quot; -- in this instance a small pickup truck -- stopped to pick us up. It was already quite loaded with people and their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">things: a bookshelf, and bags of maize, onions, and coconuts. We passed small villages and markets. We saw many people walking along the road. We passed groves of coconut and cashew trees with cassava planted between them.  We crossed three rivers and occasionally caught glimpses of Inhambane Bay in the distance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mazives live in a densely populated settlement of dislocated families about one kilometer from the center of Morrumbene. Their home consists of four small reed houses, with roofs of palm fronds. The houses are well built and attractive. The yard is swept clean, and there are well-tended flower beds. The household consists of Chadreque, Veronica, and four of their six children. Laura (22) manages the household while Veronica is away at school. Herminio (18) is apprenticed to a carpenter. Quinita (11), a 5th grader, is a slim attractive girl who cheerfully helps her mother and older sister with tasks like fetching water from the well nearly a kilometer from home. Almeida (8) is a 2nd grader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was warmly welcomed. Almeida, who had visited me at Balaza several times, was especially happy to see me and quickly brought a chair for me to sit in a shady spot in the yard. Herminio told me that I would use his house and he showed me the chairs and stool that he had made. The neighbors were surprised to see a white stranger but came to greet me. Laura put a bucket of hot water, a new bar of soap, and the family's best towel in the reed bathhouse and invited me to bathe. After that treat, Laura served tea with bread and hot crisp fried fish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Veronica took me for a walk to see their church building. The Morrumbene Church, like most of our churches, is built of poles, reeds, and palm branches. It is attractive but not very durable. As we walked along we greeted dozens of people. We passed empty houses, and Veronica explained that people are returning to the places from which they fled during the war. The Mazives will move to a bettor place, as soon as Chadreque has completed the houses he is building for the. We called on several people who were ill and prayed with them. At one home I was given a welcoming gift of eggs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saturday morning I woke to the sound of the sweep, sweep, sweep of the yard being swept clean and the chop, chop, chop of firewood being cut for the day's cooking. Having visited me many times, Veronica knows that I like an early morning cup of coffee, so, at 5 a.m., with a gentle knock on the door, she brought me a steaming cup of coffee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We left Morrumbene and went to Tinga Tinga on foot and by rowboat. We were poled through the mangroves and we saw flocks of flamingoes. Veronica met with some of the women of the Tinga Tinga Congregational Church. She helped them to prepare for their participation in the annual regional meeting of Xirilo (the uniformed women's organization). We stayed the night in the home of Agostinho and Amelia Muriane. Agostinho is a lay leader of the Tinga Tinga church, a student at the Zakewu Likumbe Bible School, a skilled mason, and the owner of two small fishing boats. Amelia served fresh shrimp for supper caught from Agostinho's boats in Morrumbene Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sunday morning, Veronica led the service in the Tinga Tinga Church.  She admitted some new members of Xirilo. They were dressed in their uniforms and acknowledged by the congregation. I preached the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sermon on the theme of the Xirilo conference: &quot;Whoever is thirsty should come to me and drink.&quot; Sunday afternoon we returned to Morrumbene by boat landing to the Mazive's home, stopping to admire Veronica's cassava field along the way. Chadreque said how much it meant to them to have me visit and I tried to tell him what a privilege it was for me to do so. I remembered the saying that you shouldn't judge a person until you have walked a distance in her moccasins. I didn't walk in Veronica's moccasins nor did I carry her 25 kilogram bag of maize on my head. But I understand her better and value her more for having walked beside her for a few days. Yours faithfully, Carol C.  Gilley</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rome, Italy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> July 26, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Food Programme today said it is quickly mobilizing and delivering the food needed for the current influx of Rwandan refugees into Zaire and was increasing efforts to distribute food inside Rwanda to attract refugees back into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'At a news briefing in Rome today Ms Catherine Bertini, WFP's Executive Director, said the Programme is actively looking at ways to encourage refugees back into Rwanda. Today, the Programme will meet with the International Committee of the Red Cross to discuss the mechanics of how this will be done. The Programme plans to set up a logistics base in Gisenyi inside Rwanda to store food and will set up drop off points and distribution points for food for the refugees in addition to it's regular distribution programme inside Rwanda. The first truck convoy to transit Rwanda from Kampala to Goma will leave tomorrow.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We hope that when the refugees in Goma see that WFP is moving food through Rwanda and know that food is available inside the country they will have the confidence to return home&quot; said Ms Bertini. &quot;The best way to end this almost apocalyptic crisis is for the people to go back to Rwanda and it is up to us to ensure that we have the food and distribution systems set up in the country that will allow this to happen.,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Programme has also been delivering food inside southern Rwanda and to the refugees in Bukavu and Uvira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP - The food organization of the United Nations - has also appealed for U.S. $76 million in new funding to cover the costs of 82,246 MT of food and related transportation costs for the 1.7 million refugees in Zaire for the next three months. To date about U.S. $23 million of this amount has been contributed by donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a meeting with international donors yesterday, Ms Bertini pointed out that it was critical for them to provide the cash and food necessary for the Programme to fill it's food pipeline to feed all the affected people in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While we received about U.S.$9 million in new contributions yesterday and donors have started to respond positively to our pleas for assistance, there is still a along way to go to meet our needs and donors must now begin to give us the money needed to fill this gap&quot; she said. The Programme in total, is supplying emergency food aid to almost 4 million people affected by the crisis in Rwanda and surrounding countries. The Programmes shortfall for this caseload for the remainder of the year is about 184,000 MT of food or about U.S.$132 million including non-food items and transportation costs.  (further assistance will be needed for the refugees in Zaire for the last three months of 1994.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Programme has quickly mobilized food aid for the new refugees in Zaire through borrowing food from it's other operations and purchases in the region. It has available about 44,000 MT of emergency food for the Zaire emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP started airlifting food to the camps in Goma July 16, 48 hours after the bulk of the refugees arrived there and now has five Iluysin 76's in operation, each capable of carrying about 35 MT on each flight. These planes are based in Nairobi , Kenya and Entebbe, Uganda. While the Programme is capable of providing at least 10 flights per day into Goma, only half that number of landing slots are available to it. To date the Programme has airlifted about 700 MT of food into Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Programme is also quickly moving to provide the trucks needed to deliver the 600 MT of food per day necessary for the refugees in Goma. The Programme has already delivered more than 1,000 MT of food by road into Goma primarily using the 54 trucks mostly from the former WFP truck fleets in Eritrea and Ethiopia which are now based in Uganda. A further 15 trucks from a commercial fleet operate in Burundi, Zaire and southern Rwanda. A further 20 trucks are available to the Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However there is a severe shortage of trucking capacity in the region which is why the Programme found it necessary to bring in trucks from other areas. WFP is also completing arrangements to bring a further 50 trucks into the emergency operations from a commercial fleet in Jordan which the Programme had previously used for relief operations in the Horn of Africa.  The first 15 of these trucks will start to be flown into Kampala on Friday through a United States military airlift. The remaining 35 trucks will go to Mombasa to load food for Zaire. With all these trucks the Programme will be in a position to deliver the complete daily food needs of refugees in Zaire in about 10 days.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. Agency for International Development Situation Report #3</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> July 13, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conflict erupted in October 1990 when the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), consisting largely of exiled Rwandan Tutsis living in Uganda, invaded Rwanda. A guerrilla war was waged primarily in the north until the two sides agreed to cease fire in July 1992 and began negotiations toward a political settlement. The conflict came to an official end when the government of Rwanda and the RPF signed the Arusha Peace Accord in Tanzania on August 4, 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 6, 1994, President Habyarimana of Rwanda, President Ntaryamira of Burundi, and a number of government officials were killed when their plane crashed approaching the airport in Kigali, Rwanda's capital. The presidents death ruptured the fragile peace signed in August, 1993. Since the crash, the government forces and the RPF have been fighting for control of the country. In addition, government forces and bands of armed guerrillas have been massacring large numbers of unarmed civilians. Foreign nationals and 258 Americans were safely evacuated from the country in the early stages of the conflict, and U.S. ambassador David Rawson closed the U.S. Embassy on April 10. Most international relief staff were also evacuated but are conducting cross-border humanitarian assistance operations to displaced persons because security within Rwanda continues to be tenuous. The United Nations Assistance Mission to Rwanda (UNAMIR) peacekeeping forces drew down their numbers in accordance with a U.N. security council Resolution. On May 17, the U.N. Security Council passed a new resolution approving the deployment of 5,500 UNAMIR troops to assist the humanitarian operations, and efforts are underway to deploy these forces. On June 22, the Security Council approved the French proposal to dispatch troops to Rwanda to act as an interim force to protect civilians and humanitarian relief efforts until UNAMIR forces arrive. The French-led deployment into Rwanda began on June 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwanda is the most densely populated country in Africa. It is the size of the state of Maryland and has a population of 8.1 million people. The population is comprised of 14% Tutsi and 85% Hutu. Since it gained independence from Belgium in 1962, Rwanda has been fraught with problems of ethnic violence that has claimed the lives of thousands of people, however, the current violence and death toll are unprecedented. Numbers Affected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unconfirmed press reports indicate that from 200,000 to 500,000 persons may have been killed throughout the country since the fighting began and the death toll mounts daily. As of July 11, United Nations Commissioner for Refugees reports that approximately 541,000 refugees have fled to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">following countries since April 6: 436,500 to Tanzania; 85.000 to Burundi; 10,000 to Uganda; and 9,720 to Zaire. Approximately 40,000 Burundian refugees remain in Rwanda out of the 300,000 who fled after the October 1993 coup attempt in Burundi. It is estimated that 50,000 people remain in Kigali out of it's original population of 300,000; 25,000 of these are displaced. As many as 2 million persons could be internally displaced, some of whom are being prevented from leaving Rwanda. General Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The violence that erupted throughout Rwanda following the April 6 plane crash has resulted in a devastating humanitarian crisis of almost unprecedented proportions. Hundreds of thousands of Rwandans have been killed in indiscriminate massacres waged against the civilian population. The extreme violence has sparked the largest and swiftest mass exodus of people ever witnessed by the UNHCR. In late April, approximately a quarter of a million people streamed across the Rwandan border into Tanzania to seek refuge in a period of less than 48 hours. The magnitude of such massive population movements has created one of the most challenging humanitarian crises in history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In early May, USAID/BHR/OFDA responded to the humanitarian crisis by deploying a two person assessment team to evaluate the needs of over 400,000 persons seeking refuge in neighboring countries. Based on the assessment teams recommendations, OFDA dispatched a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to the affected region on May 25, 1994. Political/Military Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The April 6 plane crash and subsequent deaths of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi sparked immediate massive violence throughout Rwanda. Members of the Hutu-dominated Rwandan military, well armed militia forces, and extremist civilian gangs began a large scale massacre of Hutu opposition politicians, Tutsi leaders, and civilians. The violence originated in the capital city of Kigali, but soon spread throughout the country. After the plane crash, fighting quickly erupted between the government forces and the RPF. There are also unconfirmed reports from observers in northern Tanzania that the RPF is committing atrocities against civilians as well as the government forces. The RPF now holds the eastern two-thirds of the country. In mid-June, RPF forces took Kabgayi and then pushed north to take Gitarama, forcing the interim government to flee Gisenyi. The RPF's attack on Kigali intensified the following announcement of the French intervention. On July 4, the RPF gained control of Kigali and the southern town of Butare. At the organization of African Unity (OAU) conference in mid-June, representatives of the RPF and the interim government forces verbally agreed to a cease-fire, but it was never realized. The brutal violence that erupted in Rwanda on April &not; prompted the evacuation of foreign nationals and the withdrawal of approximately 2,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops. Less than 450 U.N. troops remain in Kigali at present, although 5,500 have been approved for deployment with an expanded mandate to assist the humanitarian operations by providing security to relief workers, supplies, and beneficiaries. Several African countries, including Ghana, Ethiopia, Senegal, Zimbabwe, and Nigeria have committed to providing troops to the U.N. effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 17, France introduced a proposal in the U.N. Security Council to deploy 2,500 troops to Rwanda to act as an interim peacekeeping force until the UNAMIR force is assembled. On June 22, the U.N. Security Council voted in favor of the French-led operation, and on June 23-24 French troops were dispatched into western Rwanda through Zaire to operate under a U.N.  peacekeeping mandate. The French have stated that their mission is to protect civilians and humanitarian relief efforts, and that they will remain in the country only until UNAMIR forces have been assembled and deployed. The troops have established a &quot;safe zone&quot; defined by the prefectures of Gikongoro, Kibuye, and Cyangugu to protect vulnerable populations. French involvement in Rwanda has received support from both the U.N. and the U.S., although the RPF remains skeptical of Frances motives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 10, the U.N. Human Rights Commission's special envoy began a week long mission in Rwanda to investigate human rights abuses throughout the country. At the end of June, the report of the envoys findings was made to the Commission, stating that the massacres were a systematic campaign of genocide and preplanned. Field officers remain in Nairobi, Kenya, to continue the Commissions' investigation. Relief Efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The violence initially forced almost all relief organisations to suspend their work in Rwanda. NGOs have begun to reinstate their humanitarian relief efforts to displaced persons and refugee camps where security permits.  The U.N.'s response to the crisis is coordinate by the U.N. Rwanda Emergency Office (UNREO), which was created on April 14 when the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), U.N. Development Program (UNDP), and other U.N.  agencies decided to coordinate their efforts to provide a comprehensive relief response in Rwanda. UNREO is based in Nairobi, and the coordinating offices have been established in Kabale, Uganda ; Bujumbura, Burundi; Goma, Zaire; and Kigali. The organizations efforts have been fundamental in encouraging the coordination of NGOs and their activities, as well as in developing relationships with the RPF to formulate and implement relief efforts in RPF territories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OFDA's DART continues to coordinate and facilitate the USG's response to the humanitarian crisis in the field. The operational base of the team is located in Nairobi, Kenya, and staff have made assessment trips to Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Zaire, and Rwanda. The team, led by OFDA regional advisor Kate Farnsworth, now includes a contracts officer, and field officers in Kabale and Bujumbura. The team performs assessments of the region, reports information from the field to Washington, and provides an immediate funding mechanism to U.N. agencies, International Organizations (IOs), and NGOs for projects that address the needs of displaced persons within Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two IOs have continued to maintain an active presence in Kigali since the crisis began. International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Medecines Sans Frontieres (MSF) retain medical staff in the city to provide emergency treatment and relief items to victims. Their efforts, however, are unable to meet the massive needs of the affected population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recent reports indicate that crop production appears to be better than previously expected throughout Rwanda . However insecurity and the displacement of the population are preventing people from harvesting their crops, thereby disrupting the next agricultural season which commences in August/September. ICRC projects that if Rwandans are not able to return to their land by the end of July, significant food aid could be required until at least 1995 for an estimated one million persons. Logistical difficulties continue to hamper relief efforts, both within Rwanda and in surrounding countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nature of the crisis in Rwanda has caused health related issues to be a primary concern for the relief community. World Health Organization (WHO) issued a report stating that the disruption of basic health services in Kigali has increased the likelihood and outbreak and transmission of diseases such as cholera, dysentery, louse borne typhus, and even plague.  Efforts are being undertaken to build latrines ; vaccinate populations; build adequate water purification systems; and dispose of dead bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 25, Peter Hansen, Under Secretary General of DHA, launched the U.N. interagency flash appeal for Rwanda to the international community.  The appeal totals $11.6 million for resources required by the U.N. and intergovernmental organizations to set up programs of assistance for the internally displaced and for refugees. In early May, UNCHR issued and appeal of $56.7 million in funding to provide assistance for Burundian and Rwandan refugees in the region through July 15. ICRC revised it's emergency program for Rwanda from $28.3 million to $41 million. The International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) also revised it's appeals from $2.4 million to $9.9 million and WFP has appealed for cash and food contributions. In late June, the U.N. issued a contingency appeal to address the needs of 500,000 people over a six week period . This current appeal is intended to bridge the gap between current funding, which is nearly exhausted, and the funds that will be raised from the consolidated appeal due for release sometime in late July.  the total amount requested is $22.5 million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DOCKET, June 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Late in March, the Law Group received a call from Monique Mujawamaliya, Rwanda's leading human</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rights activist. Her tone was tense: President Juvenal Habyarimana had again violated the Arusha peace accords and she was being threatened by the presidential militia. The international community refused to respond. She and other human rights activists -- Hutus and Tutsis alike who had spent years struggling for human rights and democracy -- were convinced that a crackdown was imminent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When it came, one week later, only the catalyst -- a plane shot down while carrying Habyarimana and the president of Burundi -- was unexpected.  But the media, caught far away and unprepared, treated the ensuing tragedy as an &quot;ancient tribal conflict&quot; between Hutus and Tutsis. Readers were battered with references to &quot;tall, thin Tutsis&quot; and &quot;short, squat Hutus.&quot; Rare indeed was any other explanation for the bloodletting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reporting from Africa is reduced to simplistic caricatures and Rwanda is no exception. Tribal conflicts, particularly &quot;ancient ones, &quot; have replaced political analysis. &quot;The seeds of strife can be found in ancient ethnic rivalries,&quot; wrote the &quot;New York Times,&quot; in connection with the Congo, implying that the end of single party dictatorship unleashed aggressions pent-up since a few families first strolled out of the Olduvai gorge. But labeling African struggles as tribal disputes obscures the responsibility of those dictators still clinging to power and excuses the Western states who supported their regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the tribal explanations are simply wrong. The &quot;ethnic&quot; conflict in Natal Province of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa concerns only one ethnic group: Zulus. And last spring, two tribes -- the &quot;Kasais&quot; and &quot;Katangans&quot; used by the &quot;New York Times&quot; to explain an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ethnic conflict&quot; in southern Zaire didn't exist: Katanga and Kasai are regions, not ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Rwanda, Hutus and Tutsis, whose supposed differences became the staple of nightly news, speak the same language and share religious and many cultural traditions. Locals say they can distinguish one from the other only about 60% of the time. There was even a great deal of intermarriage until German and then Belgian colonizers elevated the minority Tutsis as a class, entrenching a social distinction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The violence in Rwanda is not an &quot;ancient tribal conflict&quot; but a modern power struggle. At a time when the Hutu and Tutsi opposition was increasingly well organized, and the regime of President Habyarimana reduced to the support of a small minority from one region, a deliberately staged bout of &quot;ancient tribal warfare&quot; was the only recourse of a military eager to stave off democratic transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Africa were truly wracked by age-old tribal strife, then there would be no need to search for culprits and little point in seeking solutions. But there are culprits; threatened leaders across Africa have an incentive to incite ethnic conflict. In Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko has all but promised to repeat the violent Congo crisis of the 1960s if he is forced from office. In Kenya, Daniel arap Moi continually cries ethnic division while allowing his own Kalenjin people to attack other ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Permitting these despots to disguise their megalomania as &quot;ancient tribal conflicts&quot; is an abdication of our international responsibilities. The journalist is spared the burden of explaining a complex political process, the former colonial power is no longer accountable, and the West can shrug its shoulders and justify paying even less attention to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, the West is already blaming itself for doing too much. Former Deputy Secretary of State Clifton R. Wharton, Jr. used the tragedy of Rwanda to claim that &quot;we cannot push democracy faster than it can be assimilated.&quot; But the United States is hardly pushing democracy in Africa. The Clinton Administration is doing even less than its predecessors to support the forces for democratic change in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Activist Ambassadors in Zaire, Kenya and Cameroon, among others, gave vigor to the later years of the Bush Administration. Their departure, followed by the hasty abandonment of Somalia and the shameful delay of action on Rwanda, have sent the clearest possible signal to Africa's dictators, old and new. From Ethiopia to Zaire, militant intransigence is being met with nothing stronger than prolonged policy reviews followed by acquiescence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a long list of countries in Africa which face risks equal to Rwanda's. In most of those, the conflict is about democratic reform, not tribal violence. When violence erupts, we should look behind the mask of &quot;ancient tribal warfare.&quot; There we will see dying dictators and generals unwilling to submit to the ballot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WHITE HOUSE, Office of the Press Secretary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> July 15, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an effort to bring an end to the fighting and growing humanitarian disaster in Rwanda, the Clinton Administration has closed the Embassy of Rwanda and ordered all personnel to leave the country. Representatives of the so-called interim government of Rwanda must depart within five working days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The White House also announced that it will begin consultations with other United Nations Security Council members to remove representatives of the interim government from Rwanda's seat on the council. The State Department declared that representatives of the Interim Government will be denied access to any Rwandan government financial holdings in the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The United States cannot allow representatives of a regime that supports genocidal massacre to remain on our soil,&quot; President Clinton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Noting that the ongoing fighting is creating an even more perilous humanitarian disaster in Rwanda and along its borders, the White House appealed to all forces to agree to an immediate cease-fire.  It called on all responsible parties to begin serious talks on forming a transitional government that will lead to genuine power sharing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The White House applauded the French effort to protect Rwandans at risk, and said the United States would continue to press for rapid deployment of the UN peacekeeping force (UNAMIR) to replace the French.  It appealed to the international community to redouble its efforts to deploy those U.N.  forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The White House again insisted that those Rwandans responsible for genocidal killings and other crimes against humanity be brought to justice.  It said it hoped that the United Nations would act swiftly -- under the Security Council Resolution that established a U.N. Commission of Experts -- to create a War Crimes Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the crisis in Rwanda has unfolded, the United States has taken a leading role in efforts to protect the Rwandan people and ensure humanitarian assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Provided more than $95 million in relief, including food, medicine and supplies for international organizations and private relief agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Flown about 100 Defense Department missions into the region to airlift relief supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strongly supported an expanded UNAMIR; airlifted 50 armored personnel carriers to Kampala to support the UN peacekeepers; and committed to equipping the U.N.'s Ghanaian peacekeeping battalion. # # #</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WHITE HOUSE, Office of the Press Secretary, (Miami, Florida)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> July 18, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a further response to the urgent humanitarian crisis in Rwanda and the Zaire border region, the President has authorized the use of an additional $19 million in emergency relief funds to provide food, medicine, other relief supplies and airlift to the victims of this crisis.  These funds, authorized under the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund, will assist the efforts of the international community, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Food Program, to address the needs of refugees and displaced persons in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These additional funds bring the total U.S. humanitarian assistance to Rwanda-Burundi this fiscal year to $139 million, including $118 million since the start of the current crisis in April.  This assistance has included support for 100 airlift missions. Another 80 missions will be undertaken in response to the immediate crisis. # # # THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary July 16, 1994 Statement by the Press Secretary The White House announced today that the President has asked U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Brian J. Atwood to travel to the Rwandan border regions in his capacity as Special Coordinator for International Disaster Assistance.  Mr. Atwood will assess relief efforts for the victims of the crisis in Rwanda and the need for enhanced assistance caused by the recent wave of new refugees across the border from Rwanda to Zaire and the increased numbers of displaced persons within Rwanda itself.  Mr. Atwood will arrive in Goma, Zaire, on Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House reaffirmed its commitment to assist the humanitarian relief effort with food, medicine and other supplies.  Since the start of the current crisis in Rwanda in April, the United States has provided a total of about $100 million, including support for 100 airlift missions.  Another 80 missions will be undertaken in the short-term. # # #</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shehu Yar'Adua, a retired general, has been on the go since the constitutional conference reconvened in Abuja last Monday. He has been meeting with members of his newly formed political group, tentatively called &quot;The Patriots,&quot; to work out a strategy which will enhance the group's chances of forming a political party when the ban on politics is lifted. &quot;The Patriots&quot; will use the conference as a shopping ground for political associations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, it has been able to enter into a working alliance with Olusola Saraki, senate leader in the Second Republic. With a determination to make himself a powerful figure at the conference, Saraki's choice as an ally of the Yar'Adua group is understandable. Saraki first made himself visible by sponsoring the motion that states be paired for the purpose of nomination into the standing order and business committees of the conference. He followed this up by emerging the representative of Kwara/Kogi states. Saraki even moved a notch higher when he became chairman of the business committee.  Members of the standing order and business committees, both of which constitute the selection committee of the whole house, will be responsible for assigning the members into the various committees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Yar'Adua group will, however, have to contend with another group from the north. This is made up of conservative elements like Bamanga Tukur, a former presidential aspirant, Umaru Dikko and Uba Ahmed, both of them key politicians in the Second Republic. Both groups hold diametrical views on a number of issues, including the arrest of Moshood Abiola, the undeclared winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential selection. While the Yar'Adua group believes Abiola should be released, the conservative group insists the detention is proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dikko, who was in exile for more than 10 years, is believed to have been nominated to the conference as a counter weight to those supporting June 12. However, he has had no impact on the conference so far. Last Wednesday, when deliberation strayed into the contentious June 12 issue, Dikko, contrary to expectations, kept mum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even though the Yar'Adua group and the conservative elements are strongly opposed to each other, both groups want to use the conference to prepare the ground for national political parties when the ban on political activities is eventually lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For delegates from the south-west, however, the conference is an avenue to canvass the sanctity of June 12. Last Wednesday, a number of delegates from the area expressed their displeasure at the annulment of the election and Abiola's detention. Dayo Abatan, a delegate from Ogun State, wondered why the man who won an election was in jail and was being conveyed to and from court in a Black Maria, while those who created the problems facing the country were enjoying government's patronage. Another delegate, Tele Olukoya, called on other delegates to examine the annulment so as to alleviate fears that other elections may suffer the same fate wondering whether the result of another presidential election would be accepted. He also called on the government to release all political detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not all the delegates from the south-west share that sentiment over June 12. Reuben Famuyibo is one of those opposed to the agitation for its restoration. Famuyibo, who is said to be a surrogate of Oladipo Diya, the chief of general staff, told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that the strong sentiment on June 12 would make the south-west lose sympathy of the other parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some delegates from the east too believe the Yoruba and the Hausa-Fulani should show more sympathy for their cause. &quot;We have come to persuade the Yorubas and the northerners to let us also taste power,&quot; says one of the eastern delegates. Indeed, having a fair share of the national cake is what the delegates will push for as soon as the eastern conference gets fully under way. &quot;Newswatch&quot; gathered in Abuja last week that the eastern agenda will unfold when the house debates marginalisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A clue to what is to be expected was given when Jossiah Odunnah from Imo State repeated the Igbo refrain on marginalisation. According to him, the Igbos have been marginalised in each succeeding regime. Another delegate from Rivers State also sang the familiar tune of his people. He expressed hard feelings that no attention has been paid to his people despite the role of oil from the place in the nation's economy and the attendant menace of its exploration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the accommodation problem that stalled the conference when it was inaugurated June 28 now over, the delegates are now prepared to settle down for business. Some 19 committee have been formed to tackle various issues.  But even as that was being done, it was glaring that some delegates nurse deep suspicion about the military. They have requested that their resolutions be regarded as final. Famuyibo suggested that a resolution be passed before the debate commences that the military should not tinker with the outcome of the deliberations. Chris Abashiya, another delegate from Kaduna State, and Paul Unongo, a delegate from Benue State, also share the distrust about the military. Unongo particularly spoke with a touch of humour. According to him, there are two political parties -- the military and the political</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">class. He warned: &quot;We should not play into their hands again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trade unions take up the fight to secure Abiola's release from detention and have him sworn in as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The buzz word in labor circles in Nigeria last week was &quot;confrontation.&quot; The unions adopted that posture to compel the federal military government to address the political and economic problems of the country. Pascal Bafyau, president of the Nigerian Labor Congress, NLC, said the inability of the government to resolve the political crisis which resulted from the annulment of the presidential election of June 12 last year, had aggravated the economic problems of the country and worsened the plight of workers. It also led to &quot;uncontrollable inflation which has further reduced the living and working conditions to a situation which had made life unbearable for the common man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bafyau cited the sharp decline in the purchasing power and value of the naira, collapse of social services even while the costs are increasing, low capacity utilization of industries, job insecurity and retrenchment, social decay in values and the drift from poverty to pauperization as the consequences of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the political crisis. Said he: &quot;For the economy to recover and be put on the path of growth and vibrancy, the political crisis and instability must be brought to an end. The Central Working Committee, CWC, (of the Congress) is convinced that the on-going strategies in resolving the political and economic crisis in the country are not producing desired results. Instead, they had worsened the situation and the misery of all Nigerians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bafyau said the CWC discussed the political crisis at its meeting in Lagos July 7 and came to the conclusion that the federal government must ease what he referred to as an unnecessary tension in the country. The Congress made a six-point demand which the NLC wanted the government to implement within 10 days. These were an immediate end to all political arrests, detention and trials, unconditional release of Moshood Abiola, undeclared winner of the annulled presidential election, and Frank Kokori, general secretary of the national Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, NUPENG.  But the police have denied that they are holding Kokori. The confusion over Kokori's whereabouts was compounded last week when Jerry Gana, the minister of information, told reporters in Abuja that the NUPENG secretary-general is actually with the police. According to him, Kokori is chatting with the police, but he is not under arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other demands were that the government should drop all charges against all political detainees, stop further arrests and harassment of labor leaders as well as re-open all shut media houses. The NLC communique was silent on actualization of Abiola's June 12 presidential mandate and re-instatement of all dissolved political structures by the Abacha regime. In the pre-amble to the six-point demand, Bafyau had specifically said the annulment was not justified. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">argued: &quot;The annulment of the election and subsequent developments since then have combined to portray our country as an object of ridicule, dented our image and diminished the confidence of the international community in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch gathered the omission of the two demands in the communique was influenced by pressure on some labor leaders by the government as well as some influential politicians. But John Gimbason, president of the National Union of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institutions, NUBIFIE, told Newswatch that the various unions were still discussing endorsing Abiola as president and disregarding the restoration of state administrations and other dissolved political structures. &quot;There is no argument whether June 12 is a reality or not. But the big</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">question is: Can we actualize June 12 without taking a look at other democratic structures?  That is what we are still looking at,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He doubted the practicability of that demand because, according to him, some former state governors and local government chairmen were a disgrace to their states and local governments. The said in Kaduna State, the people would not accept the r-instatement of Dabo Lere, the former governor.  &quot;Dabo Lere can never go near the state house. we will stone him.&quot; He said the case of Kaduna State could be replicated in Lagos, Benue, Plateau, Kano, Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Rivers. According to him, the problem was whether Abiola could become president without reinstating the old political structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The federal government saw the confrontation coming but took no steps to stop it because government officials dismissed it as a joke. For such ac confrontation to succeed in forcing the government out of office, they reasoned, the NLC must support it. At the moment, they believe the NLC is inclined towards the government and would not show partisan commitment to agitation for the revalidation of the annulled presidential election. To be sure the NLC was not dragged into the political agitation, government officials advised that Bafyau be sponsored on a trip to Geneva so that he could be free from he pressures of pro-democracy activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That strategy backfired. Bafyau's absence created an opportunity for members of the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, to not only penetrate the NLC but other unions. For instance, NADECO influenced the choice of an acting president of the NLC while Bafyau was away. NADECO also infiltrated strategic unions whose strike actions could cripple economic and social activities in the country. Of the 44 industrial unions, NADECO strategists picked only those in the oil and finance sectors. They held a series of meetings with leaders of NUPENG, NUBIFIE, Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, PENGASSAN, and the Lagos Council of the NLC.  Newswatch stumbled on one of such meetings between NADECO strategists and Kokori at the Jabita Hotels, Ikeja, in May. NADECO's strategy was to break up unions whose leadership supported the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strategy paid off. NADECO succeeded in convincing the leadership of NUPENG and PENGASSAN to plan for a political strike to force out the military government and pave way for the actualization of June 12. NADECO strategists had no problem in convincing the two unions to carry out the strike because of the collapsing state of the oil industry and its effects on the workers. For example, the union leaders were made to understand that the unending political transition program and the resultant crisis were responsible for the collapse of the oil industry because the money that should have been used to revamp it was channeled into politics. asked one NADECO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leader at one of the meetings: &quot;Is it right for this country to embark on another transition program that is bound to fail after wasting more than N40 billion to set up political structures that Abacha single- handedly pulled down?&quot; That question worked up that union leaders and toughened their resolve to confront the military government once and for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, the two unions made several demands on the government in June and wanted them fulfilled before the first week of July, failing which they would call out their members on strike. NUPENG, for example, wanted the government to fulfill 11 demands. One of the demands was that the government quit the political &quot;stage in Nigeria permanently, restore the dismantled democratic structures,. call on the acclaimed winner of the last presidential election to negotiate a peaceful hand-over of the reins of government to satisfy the yearnings of the teeming millions of Nigerians who voluntarily gave him that historic mandate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PENGASSAN made 10 demands which also included the actualization of the June 12 mandate given to Abiola, restoration of all dismantled democratic structures and the convening of a sovereign national conference. The government was not bothered by the ultimatums of the two unions because it still relied on the NLC to stall the strike threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when the NUPENG strike started July 4, the NLC could not help.  Instead,, the NLC leadership sensed that it would become irrelevant if the NUPENG strike succeeded. In desperation, Bafyau was recalled from his Geneva trip. Government also allegedly offered N&not; million to the NLC but the money was rejected after the leadership realized that the oil workers' strike would succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NLC leadership compelled Bafyau to summon an emergency meeting of the CWC Thursday July 7 to take a firm stand on the economic and political situation in the country. At that meeting most of the members told Bafyau that they felt uncomfortable with his close relationship with the government.  They accused him of taking certain decisions on behalf of the congress without consulting them. They cited his nomination as a member of the constitutional conference and his acceptance without reference to the congress. Bafyau was told that he must either go along with the popular will of the congress to lead out the workers on strike or resign. But if he failed to act, the congress was determined to pass a vote of no confidence on him and remove him. Newswatch learnt that the communique he read a t a world press conference on July 9 was drafted for him to sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government guessed the possible outcome of the July 7 CWC meeting and made desperate moves to influence it. Oladipo Diya, chief of general staff, made overtures to the NLC leaders through Bafyau to address the CWC meeting.  The request was turned down and Bafyau was advised to inform him that if government had anything to say, it should address the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strike by NUPENG got off to a shaky start but by last Monday its effect on the commercial life in Lagos and some other major cities had become serious. The participation of senior workers in the oil industry, worsened the situation. The oil companies were forced to close down their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By last Wednesday, oil production had dropped from 1.89 million barrels a day to only 900,000 barrels. Industry sources said last week the quantity could drop to 150,000 barrels by the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chevron shut down its Escravos oil terminal. Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited also closed down its Qua Iboe terminal the following day. Shell Petroleum Development Company Limited, the biggest oil producer in Nigeria, also cut down the operational level of its Bonny and Forcados terminals by half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With crude oil production disrupted, the strike spread to the refineries. Workers at the War Refinery and Petro-chemical Company joined the strike on Monday. The refinery, with a capacity of 110,000 barrels per day, had just undergone a turn-around maintenance and was expected to commence full production last week. That left only the Port Harcourt and Kaduna refineries running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, by last Wednesday, the oil pipeline taking crude oil from the Niger Delta to the Kaduna refinery ruptured near Auchi in Edo State causing a serious oil spillage. That development prompted a shutting down of the pipeline.  With no crude oil supply, the Kaduna refinery operating currently at only 50 percent of its installed capacity since last year, is expected to close down this week after exhausting its crude oil stock. Newswatch learnt that the Port Harcourt refinery with a capacity for 210,000 barrels per day was also shut down last Wednesday. It was unable to confirm that report by press time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strike action has received a near-total support among senior oil workers. Investigations last week confirmed that all the senior workers in the oil companies had withdrawn their services on Monday. In the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, the staff of the Products and Pipeline Marketing Company, PPMC, National Petroleum Investment Management Services, NAPIMS, Warri Refinery and Petrochemical Company, WRPC and the PHRC also joined the strike. As a result, soldiers deployed to lift fuel from Ejigbo oil depot in Lagos could not do so because they could not operate the equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But cracks developed in the ranks of the oil workers last week.  Workers at the Kaduna refinery said they were not part of the strike action.  The Kaduna Zonal council of PENGASSAN said after its meeting last Wednesday that its members should continue to work. Newswatch later learnt its position on the strike was influenced by northern traditional rulers who are opposed to the political demands of the striking oil workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Workers at the corporate headquarters of the NNPC also pulled out of the strike. As at last Wednesday, most of them had reported in their offices in Victoria Island and Ikoyi. A week earlier, junior workers in the corporation had also opted out of the NUPENG strike. Workers at the Warri refinery called off their strike too by Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But so far, government attempts to break the strike have been unsuccessful for two reasons. Firstly, 80 percent of the workers in the oil industry are from the southern parts of the country. Government's usual tactics in breaking politically- motivated strikes is to play on the ethnic sentiments of workers. That explains the position of the Kaduna zone of NUPENG, PENGASSAN and state councils of the NLC in the northern states. But in the case of both NUPENG and PENGASSAN, the number of workers from the north is very negligible and therefore their decision to stay out of the strike cannot register the desired impact. Moreover, all the key facilities except the Kaduna refinery employed to make the strike effective are located in the Warri-Port Harcourt-Eket axis in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, it was easy to mobilize oil workers on a political strike because of the state of the oil industry. Once regarded as a blue chip, the industry is collapsing, leading to mass retrenchment by oil service companies. Government which owns 60 percent equity shares in all joint venture companies in the industry except Shell where it owns 55 percent has defaulted in its financial contributions to the companies in the past one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the beginning of this year, it was owing the joint venture companies $1.043 billion according to Don Etibet, petroleum resources minister. By the end of last month, $791 million of the accumulated debts was paid leaving a balance of $252 million or N5.54 billion. Arthur Onoviran, national publicity secretary of PENGASSAN, explained that the debts were accumulated because government which gets 68 percent of the net proceeds from the industry is diverting resources to an endless transition program. As a result of the non-funding of the joint venture commitments, all the oil companies are forced to cut down on their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past one year, no oil company undertook any drilling operations. Oil production still depends on existing fields with no new discoveries to shore up the fast depleting resources. The industry is currently operating only 19 drilling rigs against 50 last year. Seismic operations have also been cut by 50 percent according to PENGASSAN. Most of the oil service companies have folded up. The service companies employ about 60 percent of the workforce in the oil industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even the oil producing companies are threatening to reduce their staff by as much as 30 percent. Onoviran told Newswatch that workers in the oil sector believe corruption institutionalized by the military was responsible for their woes. He said NNPC resources had been plundered through spurious contracts forced on the management by the military officers in government.  for instance, he claimed that 22 coastal tankers were currently on hire by the NNPC at an annual cost of $96 million or N2.1 billion. Foreigners are now recruited as &quot;technical back-ups&quot; for jobs hitherto performed by Nigerians.  The recruitments are handled by racket companies owned by government officials, he alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides, proceeds from oil sales are no longer accounted for. The use of Lebanese firms and front companies owned by influential Nigerians to sell crude oil has resulted in delayed remittance of sales proceeds. In some cases, returns for crude oil sales are not paid to the federation account.  Such proceeds are usually passed on to dedicated accounts which are not subject to official audit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allocation to dedicated accounts currently stand at 220,000 barrels per day. Hitherto, proceeds from crude oil sales were controlled by the NNPC which also had an allocation of about 200,000 barrels per day to fund the joint venture commitments. The cash call allocation to NNPC was abolished early this year. Consequently, NNPC now queues for disbursement of funds like every other government establishment at the treasury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The financial crunch has also affected the maintenance of NNPC refineries and plants resulting in low capacity utilization, scarcity of fuel and allied oil products. The workers are also angry that their jobs are being taken over by soldiers. The unions are accusing the government of starving the department of petroleum resources, the monitoring agency for the industry of operational resources to perpetrate fraud by its officials. Military task forces are said to have taken over the monitoring of the agency. Onoviran's grouse is that members of the task forces are not trained for the jobs they are now asked to perform and therefore cannot detect lapses and sharp practices in the industry. One of the demands of the striking oil workers is that the DPR be upgraded to an inspectorate commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The absence of an effective monitoring agency in the oil industry explains why there is a boom in oil bunkering and cross-border smuggling of fuel -- illegal activities for which PENGASSAN has accused influential Nigerians and government officials of perpetrating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from the complaints of the oil workers, the strike has also succeeded because of the tacit support of the oil companies which have been engaged in a running battle with the government to pay up their debts. For some time now, oil producing companies have witnessed declining business fortunes wing to shortage of funds for their joint venture operations. The strike by the oil workers is seen as desirable to force the hands of the government to pay up the debts.. For the oil marketing companies, the strike is also a welcome development because it will enable the government to pay them a debt of N500 million owed for products bridging to the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even within the NNPC, there is an unofficial support for the strike as the only way of checking the plundering of the corporation and interference by government officials. The convergence of the interests of the oil companies, workers and other players in the industry has provided the enabling environment for the success of the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strike has led to a rise in the prices of crude oil. By close of business last Thursday the London Brent, equivalent to Nigeria's Bonny Light, traded for $18.66 per barrel as against $17.75 on Monday. The price was expected to hit $19 per barrel by last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As at last Thursday, the country's daily loss from crude oil export was $28.2 million or N619 million. Nigeria exports 1.55 million barrels of crude oil per day out of its OPEC quota of 1.89 million barrels. For local consumption, it sets aside 330,000 barrels daily for the refineries. NNPC losses from inability to sell refined products was put at N70 million daily by oil experts last week. Besides, down time losses to oil companies were estimated at $6.1 million or N132 million a day. The losses excluded the costs suffered by most public establishments that depend on the oil industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, the National Electric Power Authority, NEPA, could not generate electricity from its four gas turbine power plants at Afam, Ughelli, Sapele and Egbin. NEPA was forced to rely on its two hydro-electric stations at Jebba and Shiroro. The two stations have a combined output of 1,400 megawatts. The national demand is 2,362 megawatts. Industrial plants such as the National Fertilizer Company of Nigeria, NAFCON, Onne, and some factories in Lagos and Aba which rely on gas like NEPA were forced to either switch on to diesel or shut down. Even most companies which also rely on parallel power generation through private generating plants were also forced to close down because of fuel shortage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strike severely affected air and land transportation in many parts of the country. Many motorists who had no fuel were forced off the road. The few commercial transport operators who managed to buy fuel at exorbitant prices jacked up transport fares by as much as 500 percent. As at last Wednesday, a 50-litter jerry can of fuel sold for between N2,500 and N3,000 in Lagos. That also affected transport fares in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air transportation was similarly affected by shortage of aviation fuel. For one week, aircraft operating domestic services were refueling at the international wing of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja.  Femi Asun, station manager of Aviation Development Corporation, ADC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airlines, said: &quot;We now spend up to four hours at the queue to refuel one aircraft, a situation that has resulted in flight delays.&quot; By 3 p.m. last Wednesday, that system had collapsed. &quot;When we went there, there was nobody to attend to us. This is making it impossible for us to operate,&quot; Asun said.  On July 13, none of the airline's nine scheduled flights took off. The ADC, according to the station manager, was losing an average income of N2 million daily from flight cancellations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harco Air Services Limited could not operate any of its 10 scheduled daily flights last week. That leaves it with a daily loss of N2 million from flight cancellations. Only the Nigeria Airways and Okada Airlines were able to operate skeletal services. Although Chris Aligbe, head of corporate information, said the Airways was getting its normal fuel supply from National Oil, two of its flights were canceled last Wednesday. One of the flights to Yola via Jos was canceled even after passengers had boarded. Other victims of flight cancellations were Emeka Anyaoku, secretary-general of the Commonwealth, and Olu Onagoruwa, federal attorney-general and minister of justice. They could not travel to Abuja for scheduled meetings last Wednesday for lack of flights. Newswatch learnt that as of Wednesday, only Kano airport had aviation fuel; but most airlines did not have fuel to take their planes there for refueling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strike also dislocated commercial and industrial activities in many parts of the country. MicCom, an indigenous electric cables manufacturer in Lagos, said the fuel shortage had caused it a daily loss of N3 million. It said the loss would continue as long as the strike lasted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation will get worse this week if the July 19 deadline by the NLC for a nation-wide strike holds. Lagos and Kwara state councils of the NLC and the Senior Staff Association of Universities, Teaching Hospitals, Research Institutes and Associated Institutions, SSAUTHRIAI, joined the strike action last week. NUBIFIE and the National Union of Road Transport Workers' Union, NURTW, were warming up for action this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was no indication late last week that the federal government would accede to the political demands of the striking workers. Jerry Gana, the information minister, was quoted last Wednesday as saying the release of Abiola as demanded by the striking workers was the responsibility of the Abuja federal high court currently trying him. The court refused Abiola bail last Thursday. Justice Mohammed Mustapha, the presiding judge, said that there was no formal application with an accompanying affidavit to support it.  Besides, he said, Abiola's lawyers had not shown enough evidence that their client would not jump bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the legal brick wall, efforts to get him released from detention were in top gear, leading to newspaper speculations last week that Abacha had ordered he be freed. Kudirat, Abiola's wife, and Kola, his eldest son, were in Abuja all of last week for this purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Kudirat and Kola are working to achieve the same objective, they differ in their strategies. Kola wants his father to renounce his claim to the June 12 presidential mandate but Kudirat wants him to stick to it. She wants her husband to be set free on his own terms. Both of them were said to have avoided Diya. Instead, they were dealing with Aminu Saleh, the secretary to the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dapo Tejuosho, the Ohile of Okeona and a nominated member to the constitutional conference, was also exploring other contacts to get Abiola released. He is a member of the conference's business committee. In his new position, Tejuosho has taken over the campaign to secure Abiola's release.  Although he could not convince Okunade Sijuwade, the Ooni of Ife, to come to Abuja to persuade Abiola to drop his claim to the presidency, he succeeded in reaching out to other Yoruba leaders, including the Alafin of Oyo, the Ewi of Ado Ekiti and Michael Adekunle Ajasin, former civilian governor of Ondo State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch learnt the government was prepared as early as last Monday to release Abiola if he agreed to renounce his claim to the presidency. A source at the presidency said government's condition for Abiola's release agreed with the standpoint of Kola that his father should forget about politics and face his business. Kola's position is already causing problems not only with his father's wives who are opposed to it but also with NADECO.  Kola is reportedly fighting Kudirat, saying she is pushing his father into a struggle that would finally destroy him. He believes June 12 is dead and should be laid to rest. Abiola was said to have rejected Kola's position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Kola has not given up. He now wants influential Yoruba leaders to persuade his father to reason with him. Already, he has visited Olusegun Obasanjo, former head of state, to speak to his father on the futility of trying to actualize the annulled mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to Kola's request, Obasanjo led a team of some Yoruba leaders made up of Richard Akinjide, a former justice minister, A.M.A.  Akinloye, former national chairman of the National Party of Nigeria, NPN, Layi Balogun, a former presidential aspirant, among others to meet Ajasin at his Owo residence July 10 to brainstorm on how the political crisis could be resolved. Unfortunately, Obasanjo's visit to Owo created a deep suspicion among pro-June 12 supporters who feel increasingly worried about his role in the political crisis in view of a campaign going on for the formation of another interim government as a way out of the current crisis. Canvassers of the interim government idea want Obasanjo to head it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea is said to have been sold to Walter Carrington, the United States ambassador in Nigeria, as well as to Jesse Jackson and Andrew Young, both prominent black Americans. In turn, they are selling the idea to the State Department. But Edward C. Oparaoji, chairman on the Nigerian Democratic Awareness Committee based in the U.S., has already petitioned the State Department disagreeing with the idea of an interim government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, perhaps, accounted for the initial rebuff of Obasanjo and his team by Ajasin and the pro-June 12 supporters who insisted on the presence of key progressives like Olu Falae and Remi Okunrinboye before Ajasin could listen to them. At the meeting, Ajasin told Obasanjo that there was no going back on June 12 as far as the Yoruba were concerned and that the Yoruba were not prepared to trade the mandate for his release. Newswatch sources said Obasanjo met Abacha in Aso Rock last Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NADECO said last week that it was prepared for a long drawn out war with the government to secure Abiola's freedom and the actualization of his mandate. It said it would intensify grassroots mobilization of opposition to the present regime. Apart from the trade unions, it said it had reached out to various groups like students market women and professionals to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">support the struggle.  Said a NADECO leader: &quot;Our role is to act as a catalyst. We will gather all pro- democracy forces together, fine--tune their individual strategies, advise them on the mode and appropriateness of their action and give them moral and material support.&quot; That strategy has started to show some results. The group itself has adjourned its general house sine die because it believes it has been infiltrated by government. A group of its elders will now coordinate all NADECO's activities. In Lagos, market women and lawyers have organized a series of protests in the last three weeks to press for Abiola's freedom. Newswatch learnt that the students, under the auspices of the National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, were also planning a big showdown with the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pressure for release of Abiola is also coming from Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, a retired major-general and a constitutional conference delegate.  With pressures coming from various directions, it is very likely government will set him free soon. But if it does not and its planned talks with labor leaders fail, then there might be tougher days ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government appears to have made up its mind to face the showdown as security reports have indicated. It has handed over the management of security in Abuja for the next six months to MOSAD, an Israeli secret service. Already, 28 MOSAD agents, made up of four officers and 24 other ranks, are in Abuja. Their services will cost Nigeria $2 million a month.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ARTICLE 19: THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE AGAINST CENSORSHIP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> July 21, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malawi will be seen by many as an example of a successful transition forced upon an undemocratic government from outside and below. It moved from 30 years of autocratic rule, through a relatively open and peaceful campaign period, with elections recognized by international observers as expressing the will of the people, in to a new era of multi-party democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In many ways this is a faithful representation of events. Compared to the transition process in some other states, the campaign and election were peaceful and orderly, and, when the results were known, the old order calmly gave way to the new with grace and dignity. Nevertheless, most Malawians would agree that their nation has a long way to go before its transition is complete. Indeed, the new United Democratic Front (UDF) government, led by President Bakili Muluzi and Vice-President Justin Malewezi, was elected because it promised change. Its promise of free primary schooling in a country where illiteracy runs upwards of 60 percent was warmly greeted by voters. It also promised to alleviate poverty and improve other services including hospitals and roads.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Statistics recently released by government for the first time demonstrate what observers have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">suspected all along: Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world.  There is also an urgent need to meet emergency food needs in this year of drought, a need which took President Muluzi on visits to food- exporting, neighbouring states within two weeks of taking office. Demonstrating an awareness of human rights issues, he also promptly closed three prisons renowned for their cruel treatment of detainees and released any political prisoners still being held by Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda's outgoing government. He commuted all death sentences to life imprisonment, affecting 120 people immediately and as many as 300 untried capital cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Muluzi inherits a country where poverty and illiteracy are widespread, the birth rate is high, capital is scarce, and commercial agriculture, industry and trade are underdeveloped. The task of transforming the economy is a daunting one and will not be accomplished easily or quickly.  It is unlikely, however, that real political reform can be accomplished without it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is unfortunate that following 30 years of enforced ignorance, politicians and journalists failed to sue the campaign period to analyze these issues in any detail for the electorate. Few people understand the seriousness of the situation, and therefore envision easy solutions to these difficult problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expectations are high: people want change now. This disjuncture between public expectations and real possibilities is a cause for concern. It can only be combated by dissemination of accurate information to the public about the true nature of conditions in Malawi. To fail to do so will have serious political and social consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, in spite of claims to the contrary, 30 years of rule by the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) did little to eliminate regionalism from politics. In fact, Dr. Banda's policies exacerbated the problem by conferring privileges on certain ethnic groups and regions while restricting those of others. This situation was exacerbated during the campaign by the failure of politicians and the media to discuss issues around which people could unite, such as differences of opinion on land reform, foreign relations, development initiatives or social policy. With little to differentiate candidates, most voters appear to have voted for presidential and parliamentary representatives according to their charismatic appeal or their tribal, linguistic or regional origins. The three major parties dominated the three regions of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country: in the parliamentary election, 85 percent of the votes cast in the North were for the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD), 64 percent of the votes in the Central Region went to the MCP, and 76 percent of the electorate in the South voted for the UDF. Articulated class divisions that might have cut across ethnic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">divisions failed to become an election issue: the legacy of years of suppression of trade unions and political activity meant that peasants and workers were unable to have their protests heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strong government policies are needed to create a national consensus without heightened regionalism. This process can also be facilitated by the media if they effectively analyze and inform the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to play such a role, the media in Malawi will need to change and develop, becoming more issue-oriented, critical, analytical, and skilled.  Malawian journalists and donors are drafting strategies for media reform (see below). Reforms in other areas have progressed further, beginning with the new constitutional provisions aimed at redressing the injustices and grievances of the last three decades. The task now is to implement these provisions. Conclusions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ARTICLE 19 has learned that monitoring a campaign and an election in an effort to determine whether they are free or fair is a business fraught with contradictions. In the first place, it is worth noting that power of a sort is gained by any observer group whose views are solicited, making its opinions and judgments a target of pressure from institutions determined to subvert or manipulate them. At its most crude, political parties may try to gain credibility by flooding monitors' offices with complaints. On the other hand, with utmost subtlety, diplomats from donor countries will expect observers' pronouncements to confirm the wisdom of their aid policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other words, observers find themselves in the unenviable position of being expected by some to pronounce serious reservations and by others to declare elections &quot;free and fair.&quot; For this reason, it is important that observers enter the exercise with as few predispositions as possible, that they understand what is expected of them, who might try to manipulate them, and how it might be done, They must also accept that their psychological predisposition is to insist that they understand what they see in a village, even when the circumstances are not as they appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have also discovered that in order to begin to determine the fairness of a poll, monitors must at the same time try to see the broader picture. It is unlikely, except in cases of the most flagrant abuse, that observers will be able to assess accurately the fairness of an election campaign if only the last few days of it are monitored. There are many, many ways an election can be rigged, and few are noticeable by people who visit only briefly, do not understand the power relationships of the people they meet and do not know the language. At the least, monitors should arrive a few months in advance of the election, and work through local institutions, such as churches or human rights groups. Even then, observers must accept that in many cases they just will not know if intimidation has taken place, or ho much of an impact it might have on the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taking these reservations into account, ARTICLE 19 nevertheless considers that the international community was right in proclaiming the elections relatively free and representative. The Electoral Commission deserves special mention for the independent and pragmatic way it performed its work. The appointment of Justice Msosa, who maintained a refreshingly straightforward approach, set the tone, Dr. Banda's acceptance of the results provided Malawi with an opportunity to move forward in peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, ARTICLE 19 recognizes that the MBC did make an effort to present the campaign news fairly and to broadcast civic education fully. Its coverage of the election results shows just how much is possible, if training is instituted at the MBC, if resources are made available and if it is granted editorial independence. MANA would benefit from similar assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet Malawi still faces the hardest part of its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transition: overcoming its impoverishment, illiteracy and underdevelopment.  We fear that democratic principles will fall on stony ground unless the transition includes the creation of jobs and wealth, thereby giving the fledgling democratic institutions a chance to take root. In order to achieve this goal, free and open debate of policy alternatives is essential. ARTICLE 19 remains convinced that fundamental media reform will be necessary to ensure that this transition process does not become distorted and die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reform is not simply a matter of creating a legal or institutional climate where journalists and broadcasters can work, but must encompass economic reform as well. An independent press, according to the Windhoek Declaration, is one that is free from government political and economic control, as well as &quot;from (government) control of materials and infrastructure essential for the production and dissemination of newspapers, magazines and periodicals.&quot; Three years ago in Namibia, the international community was called upon to assist in the creation of a pluralistic African press by &quot;funding support towards the development and establishment of non-governmental newspapers, magazines and periodicals that reflect the society as a whole and the different points of view within the communities that they serve.&quot; When that was written,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the political transition in Malawi had not begun: only government-controlled daily and weekly newspapers and the single government-owned radio station operated. Now, dozens of independent Malawian journalists and publishers, in the forefront of the struggle to keep democracy alive, are asking the international community to recognize that their need is the same as those African journalists who met in Windhoek three years ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, July 15, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's traditional leftwing tussles with a 'pragmatist' camp for the soul of the party. Paul Stober reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African National Congress' parliamentary caucus has become the front line of a battle between the organisation's &quot;socialist&quot; and &quot;pragmatic&quot; camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to ANC parliamentary sources, the battle is about the future direction of the ANC. This revolves around the question as to whether the organisation and its parliamentarians will be watchdogs keeping a check on government, or whether it will become a tool of government to be used to sell state policy to ANC supporters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beneath this, a subtle ideological struggle is also being waged between the ANC's traditional left, who accuse the ANC leadership in government of abandoning the organisation's commitment to far- reaching social and economic reconstruction, and some ANC members in government who want the state to follow more &quot;pragmatic&quot; economic and social policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC sources say the &quot;pragmatists&quot; are based mainly in the cabinet and are accused of sacrificing ANC interests in order to cut deals with other political parties and big business, to secure a broad- based political centre that can oversee a successful transition. They are said to include Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, Defence Minister Joe Modise, Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo, Trade and IndustryMinister Trevor Manuel and PWV Premier Tokyo Sexwale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are opposed in the parliamentary caucus by those who want ANC cabinet ministers to promote the organisation's policies and radically restructure government and public service. These include trade unionists put on the ANC's election list by Cosatu and by ANC political education head Raymond Suttner and SACP rising star Blade Nzimande.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minister without portfolio Jay Naidoo, who is overseeing the Reconstruction and Development Programme from the president's office, is believed to lean towards this camp. Although Naidoo's portfolio makes him politically powerful, he is unable to make waves because many aspects of the RDP fall under the control of other ministries, which have to carry out the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SACP stalwart and housing minister Joe Slovo is said to have opted to stay out of the fight. His health is poor and he wants to focus on his portfolio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not clear where public service and administration minister Zola Skweyiya stands in relation to the ideological battle. What is known, however, is that Skweyiya is a powerful figure who has the ear of President Nelson Mandela. There have been a number of skirmishes between the camps over relatively minor issues in the caucus. But at the last caucus meeting the parliamentarians made a significant gain when ANC cabinet ministers agreed to form an ANC cabinet caucus to pursue the organisation's policies in government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's national working committee and cabinet ministers met earlier this week to discuss the relationship between the ANC and government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The battle between the two camps will most likely come to a head at the ANC's next national congress, tentatively set for December. The traditional left is pushing for a clear break between cabinet and the ANC leadership, and jockeying for positions on the organisation's national working committee has already begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SACP mainstream and Cosatu appear to be lining up behind ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa, who is tipped as a strong contender for the post of ANC president when Mandela retires. Although Cosatu _ and to a lesser extent the SACP _ have been casting around for political direction since many of their leading intellectuals were elected to government, Ramaphosa still has grassroots support among ANC and Cosatu activists. He is seen as having the skill to build the ANC into a strong mass organisation which will continue to function independently of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC also has other influential leaders outside parliament, including leading SACP intellectual Jeremy Cronin and the ANC's RDP head, Cheryl Carolus. Cosatu and SACP activists and leaders are engaged in a furious debate about how best to revive their organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The battle is likely to become increasingly heated in the run-up to the congress. Both sides know there will be nothing bigger than the ANC in South African politics for the next ten years, and the future policies of the government will be decided by those who control the organisation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, July 29, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As MPs get ready to reconvene parliament next week, Ian Clayton analyses the tensions in the Government of National Unity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE fragile political unity in the Government of National Unity -- with the ANC, the National Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party as unlikely bedfellows -- is coming under strain as MPs and party members become increasingly restless about the compromises necessary to make the deal work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the immediate post-election and post- inauguration phase, party leaders were able to preserve the image of common purpose in the interests of the broad goals of promoting democracy and reconstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that is beginning to come unstuck -- and will come under increasing pressure in the next four months as parliament gets down to the serious business of dismantling the bureaucratic apartheid empire and replacing it with democratic structures. And, as reports this week reflected, the NP could be the first to break ranks, although it will almost certainly not quit the GNU at this stage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NP MPs are envious that the tiny and much- scorned Democratic Party has emerged as the parliamentary opposition to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government, and the ANC in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, so jealous are they of the role played by DP acting leader Tony Leon in exposing the police and the ANC over the Shell House shootings in which eight IFP supporters were killed, that the NP's chief whip, Hennie Smit, says the party wants to play a dual role as both an opposition party and as &quot;responsible co-governors&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP's real problem, though, is more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fundamental: it has lost its purpose. The party that tried to force apartheid on South Africa with missionary zeal became the party of the gravy train. It handed out jobs and high income positions to loyalists, people who served the government machine as long as they were paid. And that has all but gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its one common ideological strain was an all- embracing anti- communism, but now it sits in the GNU with communists. After February 2 1990, and with the election of FW de Klerk as its leader -- remember how he just managed to defeat Barend du Plessis -- the NP did, briefly, become a party of reform, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that ended with the April election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With its historical baggage, the NP does not have much to contribute to the building of democracy and redressing its own wrong-doing. As it stumbles around, a process aided by De Klerk's holiday in Europe -- which has left the party rudderless for many weeks -- it's an open secret that many of its old guard, particularly former ministers and deputy ministers, are considering taking their pensions and getting out while the going is good. A number of NP MPs are expected to quit before the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As De Klerk re-enters active politics, he may be able to use his stature and charm to stamp his authority on the NP's troubled caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week, the salt was rubbed into the NP's wound by Justice Minister Dullah Omar's statements of solidarity with Cuba. Nothing could be further from the NP's ideological soul and yet it is part of the same government as Omar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC caucus, too, has similar problems. Many ordinary MPs simply cannot handle being on the same side -- or at least being seen to be on the same side -- as the NP and particularly the IFP. And the compromises in the GNU are often painful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African Communist Party's attack on President Nelson Mandela's statements about the wave of strikes must be seen in the context of the problems being faced internally by the ANC alliance about its role in government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As parliament reconvenes next week to debate the welter of legislation facing it and the first 100 days of Mandela's government, these tensions are bound to become more obvious. But for the time being at least, the GNU is expected to survive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAILY OBSERVER, July 25, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was on my way to Brikama on that fateful Friday morning when the driver of the mini-van I was in suddenly made a sharp swerve at the intersection leading to the airport. Everybody was puzzled about this sudden move, but things started to take shape in the next few minutes, as we all began to witness a historic event unfold tight before our very eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alighting from the mini-van, I soon discovered the reason for the driver's move. A flurry of activity was in progress around the vicinity of the Yundum army barracks. Soldiers were milling about apparently attempting to commandeer passing vehicles in which they were quite successful as they soon took over a GPTC mini-van and two trucks. Momentarily the three vehicles were careening down the highway towards Banjul at breakneck speed full of heavily armed soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Murmurs from the bewildered crowd indicated that the soldiers were staging a demonstration because they had not received their salaries. Other opinions indicated that the army was on a joint military exercise with US Navy personnel who arrived the previous day aboard the naval vessel, USS La Moure County. My journalistic instinct, however, told me that this was not a mere event, and I hopped into a passing GPTC bus to further try to find out what the soldiers were up to.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Lamin, all traffic was brought to a halt as one of the trucks was fueling up at the Shell Petrol station. I quickly jumped out of the bus, and walked slowly towards the petrol station in the hope that I might find out the intentions of the soldiers. However, as my approach became recognized, I was angrily asked to stop in my tracks by one of the soldiers, and when I identified myself as a journalist, he retorted, &quot;We do not have any need for journalists at this time, so turn back and go,&quot; whilst he menacingly pointed his gun at me. I needed no further warning so I returned to the bus. Soon after the soldiers departed, the traffic was reopened, and we continued our journey into the unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Kanifing, the driver announced that he was not proceeding any further. Everyone scrambled out of the bus in anticipation of picking up another transport bound for Banjul. To our dismay, however, it was learnt that all Banjul-bound traffic was being turned back at Denton Bridge. In the melee, I managed to secure a lift, but the driver told me that he was going to Bakau and can only drop me at the intersection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I intended to walk the rest of the way, but luckily enough, I was picked up by another motorist. As we approached the bridge we saw a multitude of different transports being turned back by tow armed soldiers. I walked up to one of them and identified myself in the hope that e would let me across.  I was now keenly anxious to get to Banjul because whatever was brewing at this juncture must be centered there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The soldiers however turned down my request and asked me to turn back for my own safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just that moment, I caught sight of a colleague, Momodou Musa Secka, of the &quot;Daily Observer&quot; who had been similarly rebuffed by the soldiers. We decided to proceed to the &quot;Daily Observer&quot; office in Bakau from where we could plan our next move. Moments after we arrived, we could hear the sound of gunshots emanating from the TSG headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without hesitating we decided to go and investigate. At the Bakau Fire Station, we met a group of people who were talking among themselves in a hushed manner. We asked them what was going on inside the TSG premises, and they told us that some 20 soldiers of the Gambia National Army had raided the barracks, and were in the process of disarming and arresting the TSG and Police personnel there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We approached the barracks carefully, and as we got closed a soldier on guard at the gate signalled us to come forward by only with our hands held up. He asked us for identification, and when I proffered my &quot;Daily Observer&quot; press card, he geared into action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He began raving about journalists telling lies to the Government. &quot;You are from the &quot;Observer&quot; but today we will be observing you.&quot; At gun point, we were marched into the barracks, and at the entrance, we were asked to board a truck full of captured TSG and policemen and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I estimated our number to range between 30 and 40 which made conditions very uncomfortable. After what seemed an eternity, the truck suddenly took off without warning making us pile on top of one another. I understood from conversations going on that we were being taken to the Army Barracks, at Yundum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a most uncomfortable drive. By now people were milling on the roadside to satisfy their curiosity and to cheer the soldiers who were then the only ones using the roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When we arrived at the army barracks, we were herded out. One of the soldiers reported to a lieutenant that we were two journalists. The lieutenant promptly instructed him to take us to the mess room until he was ready to deal with us. We, however, ended up in another room where we were kept under guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By then we were getting restless because we were civilians and could not understand why we were being detained. We therefore requested to be brought before one Captain Momar Cham who was apparently in command of the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Capt. Cham turned out to be a very polite officer who explained the situation to us. He said that what was happening in the country was of concern to everyone, and added that the army was trying to bring things under control. He told us to exercise patience and that if things became normal, we would be allowed to go. He gave us some cigarettes and promised to come back to us later on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few minutes later, however, a soldier walked into the room and asked us to follow him. We were taken to the place where the main body of detainees were held and locked in. Not long, a lieutenant walked into the room and gave a short speech in which he tried to allay our fears. &quot;You are in safe hands,&quot; he declared, &quot;no one here is going to be killed. We are just trying to rectify 30 years of mismanagement and corruption. Just as soon as the situation is brought under control, we will release you all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We kept on waiting. Cigarettes were distributed and lunch was also served. After what seemed an eternity, Captain Sarr came for us and led us to the Senior Officer's mess. Along the way, he told that Mr.. Ebun Jack, the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Defence, and Mr. Kebba Ceesay, the Director of the National Security Service, were being held there and he would like us to have a word with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We were asked to be seated in the outer room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was another long wait until around 5pm when Captain Sheriff Sarr emerged from the inner room to inform us that we were to go with him to Radio Syd where an announcement would be made. We were joined in the vehicle by Captain Badjie and two NCOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When we reached Radio Syd however, the place was deserted and Captain Sarr instructed the driver to proceed to State House in Banjul. At State House we were introduced to the rest of the officer corps who successfully planned and executed the couple</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lt. Edward Singhatey, a highly composed officer, gave us a quick briefing in which he indicated that there was not a single casualty largely because the Presidential Guards decided to join them rather than offer resistance. He told us that the President together with the Vice President and the Inspector General of Police were seeking refuge in the US ship, USS La Moure County, and that the Minister of Information and Broadcasting and the Minister of Justice were being held at Marine Unit headquarters in Banjul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the briefing, I was provided with an escort to take me home for by then the curfew was almost two hours old...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAILY OBSERVER, July 25, 1994 In the aftermath of Friday's bloodless takeover by the Provisional Ruling Council, Observer's Rodney D. Sieh, also the BBC's Banjul Correspondent, accompanied by Momodou Musa Secka, also of the Observer, met with the head of the 4-man council at State House. In this interview, the young Lieutenant explained what led to the takeover, the forming of a new government and among other things, the fate of former government officials. This is how it went.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAILY OBSERVER: How long was this takeover planned?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt. Yaya Jammeh: Well, it was planned within 24 hours, because when we came from the airport where we went to welcome the President from his annual leave, we were humiliated publicly because the politicians accused us of plotting to overthrow the government, and we were searched in public. All soldiers were searched, weapons seized. And that was the straw. I myself was disarmed even though most of time I'm armed, but on that day I was disarmed for no apparent reason.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None of them could take action to inculcate discipline in the PPP regime and there was random plundering of the country's assets, just to benefit a few people. So we realised that even though we hated coming to power, because we were not elected by the people, we had to make sure that the people had their voice so that is why we decided to come here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: What is the fate of former ministers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: We are not out to take revenge, okay, we do not want to go out and hunt for them, to give the public the impression that we are out to harm anybody. We are not here for that. They are Gambians, wherever they run, they will come back. I want to make sure that their conscience will prevail upon their emotions to come for accountability. No minister needs to be afraid. We are not going to set up any military tribunal to try anybody. We are going to institute a government that is composed of mostly civilians and a civilian judicial system will be put into place to try civilians, and those who will be tried will be tried publicly. We are not here to set up secret military tribunal; we are not here to set up anybody but what we want is for the nation's assets that have been plundered to be returned to the state for the benefit of all Gambians. This is why we are not hunting anybody. We want all of them to report to the nearest police station. If they fail to do so we would get them because they have their families here. They'll come back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: So far, how many former ministers have you been able to capture?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: Well it's not a question of capturing any minister. It's a question of taking them into custody. For their own protection. Because the masses of the people would lynch any minister that is seen in the street and we don't want bloodshed. We don't want to shed anybody's blood, we don't want any counter resistance, and we don't want anybody to take the law into his own hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: How soon should we expect a new government to be named?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: A new government will be named as soon as possible. We are not naming a government now, because we need the support of the civilians, intellectuals and patriotic Gambians who are clean, who will make sure that they serve in their appointments without fear or favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: What are your plans for the establishment of democracy, which was one of your main objectives for taking over?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: Well, as soon as a new government is instituted which is composed of mostly civilians, democracy would be in place and we will welcome all contributions from all corners of the country to make sure that everything is done in the right way and that transparency and accountability will be the order of the day. We will not tolerate any sort of corruption, we will not be secretive in anything that we do. We want the press and the international community, including Gambians, to criticise us where we go wrong. We are not here for praises, we are not here to enrich ourselves. We are here to set up a just system that is not corruptible, to make sure that the living standards of Gambians will be augmented to an acceptable standard within the limits of our resources. But we are not here to sue the limited resources of the country for our own good at the detriment of the masses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: Did you encounter any resistance during the takeover?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: We encountered a lot of resistance from the TSG, their commando unit and the Police. We came under fire. We marched from Yundum to State House, but we never returned any fire because we did not want to shed any Gambian blood. We are not here to shed innocent blood and we are even not here to shed anybody's blood. We are blood thirsty military officers. We were obliged by the urgency of the situation to step in and that is why we have warned them that we are not here for a bloodbath. We are more heavily armed than they. If we had released our heavy weapons it would have been a catastrophe; that is why we did not even release any weapon, we just kept on the advance and those of their officers who came forward we told them of our resolved to march to the State House and take it over to overthrow the government under all circumstances and at any cost, and if they continued to fire at us, we may retaliate which was not our aim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: So as far as you are concerned, there was no bloodshed during the takeover?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: We marched from Yundum to Banjul, took over the TSG headquarters State House, took forces and there was no bloodshed. No civilian was shot.  Nobody was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: What is the rapport between the army and the police now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: Well, you see, we are here for a common interest and the differences in uniform do not signify differences in patriotism. They have understood the situation because most of us are from the provinces, we are people who are suffering. Everybody's relatives are suffering. They know that they are suffering the same injustices. So at the end of the day we have to come together for a common cause. We are working harmoniously, we are not sidelining anybody, we are grouping together, having meetings, integrating the forces, joint patrols and there is a harmonious relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D: So since Friday, the national and international telephone lines have been cut off and this has developed into the international community misinterpreting what actually took place. How soon do we expect these lines to be opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: Well the reason for cutting off the international telephone lines was the fact that some of the former ministers were making calls t some people outside for what reason we don't know. it was necessary to cut off the international lines to make sure that nobody misinformed the international public as to what was going on here. That is the reason we cut off the international lines, but we have giving order for GAMTEL to re-open them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: How soon will that take place?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: Well, what happens is that those people responsible for the restoration of the lines disappeared, and we had to go in search of them until they were found. They said it would take a number of hours to restore the international lines and we hope that they will be restored soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: Do you have any intention of including any member of the PPP government in your new structure?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: You see, we are not painting all members of the PPP government as bad or corrupt. Whoever is clean and has the interest of the country at heart rather than personal interest is welcome to be a part of the government, because we want advice, we want people who have contributed positively to the development of the country under constraints, we want them in the new government. We are not sidelining anyone who is clean. We are not out to wipe out the entire PPP. There are some good guys in the PPP and they are free to come forward and we'll sit together and work in the interest of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: There have been conflicting reports about the situation of the former Vice President Sabally. Is it true that he has been captured?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: Well, it is not true that the Vice President has been captured. He is in safe hands, he is with the president aboard an American vessel together with the Inspector General of Police and some officers of the presidential guard and the Police, including the ADC; they are on board the American vessel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: How did they get there?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: How they got there I am not certain, but for some reason the ship was anchored at the port waiting for the exercise that was supposed to have taken place, when we decided to put a stop to the plunder and the looting of national assets for the benefit of a very few. So, as we were advancing towards State House, knowing that all the forces they had put to counter us had failed to stop our advance, I think that's when they decided to flee into the ship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: Will you make any effort to question them about the whereabouts of the government funds?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: Well, it is up to them to come back as Gambians and account for whatever they have to account for whatever they want to account for. But as for the President, we all know that we owe it to him that the name of The Gambia has reached the international level and we respect him; but the people who were behind him misled him, were corrupt, did whatever they wanted to do because he was too lenient. We have no intention of harming him -- the former president -- or humiliating him. We want to treat him as an elderly man. He is free to come to the country as a Gambian citizen and we can provide for his security if he needs it, and from time to time we will need to consult him. We will not sideline him, we will consult him for advice. We have nothing against him, but the people behind him were doing whatever they wanted, uncontrolled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: A four man council has been set up, who is in charge of this council?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: Well I am in charge of the council, but being a four man council doesn't mean that that is where it stops. We are going to incorporate civilians, put civilians and members of the armed forces into the council to make sure that it is a broad based council to make decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: Do you have any advice for the public or for Gambian citizens who may be panicking because they don't know what the situation is now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: The Gambian public have no cause to panic, because since we came in we have made sure that there was no rampage, there was no looting, there was no bloodshed and we provided patrols to make sure that Gambians are safe because we do not want anybody to take the law into his or her own hands or settle old scores. We are not here for bloodshed, we are not here to harass anybody. The masses of the Gambian people suffered under this system and they need not fear us simply because we are soldiers. We are not setting up a military dictatorship to dictate what is going to happen, we are here for the public to know that they have to contribute positively for the development of the country, everyone, irrespective of where you come from, what language you speak or what you do. This is our main objective, so we are assuring all Gambians that we are here for them, not for our own interest, but for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: So how soon, then, can the ordinary Gambian say, &quot;I am looking forward to free and fair elections&quot;, what timetable can you give?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: Well, we are not giving any timetable for free and fair elections.  That does not mean that we are here to stay too long. We are not here for that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: How long then?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: I cannot give you a fixed timetable because we have to make sure that Gambians are aware of what their rights are, what kind of leaders they want, and what type of system they want to put into effect in this country, that's all. And we also want to make sure that the term of the presidency in this country is limited. We don't want life presidency, a president who will rule for decades, so from that you will know that we are just transitional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO: So what term are you suggesting for presidency in The Gambia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.J: Well, that will be up to the Gambian people. I am not here to dictate what should happen to the Gambians. We will organise a national electoral commission and a referendum as well to ask the people of The Gambia what kind of leaders they want and the term of office they want that leadership to serve. Certainly it will not be a term that will exceed then years, in fact, ten years is too much for a Third World country like The Gambia so we will make sure that there's a democratic system of government that will be elected buy the people and that can be kicked out by the people if they don't want it, peacefully, and through the ballot box, and that is all we want.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, August 05-09, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW BOOK ON WOLE SOYINKA'S 60TH BIRTHDAY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To celebrate the 60th birthday of Wole Soyinka, Heinemann has unveiled a collection of essays which pay tribute to the Nigerian writer's many achievements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The anthology, Wole Soyinka: An Appraisal, is prefaced by Soyinka's own Nobel speech of 1986, which voiced his overriding concern for justice and freedom- a driving force in his life as well as his literature; and the concluding contribution, an interview he gave to Boyi Bandele-Thomas some seven years on, bears witness to that unflagging concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other contributors include both fellow writers and distinguished academics.  Some, like Nadine Gordimer, have chosen to record their personal and professional regard for Soyinka, while others, such as Wilson Harris and Abdulrazak Burnah, adopt a more critical- though constrictive and no less appreciative stance towards Soyinka's plays, poetry or novels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Femi Osofisan, fellow Nigerian playwright, combines the two approaches in a personal memoir of the man and his life and interpretation of his work and a heartfelt acknowledgment of Soyinka's vital and continuing influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wole Soyinka is one of the most original and multifarious writers, whose astonishing output of plays, novels, poems, autobiographies, essays and social commentaries are read and studied throughout the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soyinka's reputation was established in 1966 when he won the New Statesman John Whiting Drama prize (1966-67) and flourished when, despite his imprisonment in the late 1960s, he continued to write and was awarded the New Statesmen Jock Campbell Literary Prize for his first novel, The Interpreters. Soyinka was later appointed Overseas Fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge, where he wrote the widely acclaimed Death and the King's Horseman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The George Benson Medal of the Royal Society of Literature and the UNESCO Medal for the Arts were to follow, and this glittering array of awards culminated in 1986, when Soyinka became the first African writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW NATION, August 19,1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If government's performance during its first hundred days of rule is to be measured in terms of what has visibly been acheived in terms of concrete delivery, there would be little to gloat about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Except for the lone model house in a vast stretch of land somewhere in the PWV, or lenghty queues at clinics for free health care, there is little that has visibly changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unemployment continues at record levels, urban and rural development has not transcended beyond being an RDP buzz word and education remains in a crisis when assesed in terms of the amount of learning that is taking place in black schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And except for the restitution of land to residents forcibly removed from Mogopa near Ventersdorp in the western Transvaal, the process of restoring ownership of land to those dispossessed by apartheid remains largely unaccomplished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But should government's performance be measured on the basis of concrete delivery chalked up in 100- days? If the transition was simply transferring government from one party to another, without the need for major restructuring, such as in established democracies, it would have been appropriate to subject performance to such a 100-day test.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a country that has undergone a major transition from hundreds of years of white minority rule, of which 46 were devoted to statuatory apartheid, the 100-day test, linked to delivery of houses, schools, water reticulation, electricity, etc, is clearly an inappropiate one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What needs to be assesed is the extent to which the government has suceeded in re-organizing its administrative infrastructure and tuning it into the priorities identified in the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The RDP is about restructuring, and the government will need all of the five years it has been given by the electorate to do that,&quot; one analyst monitoring the reconstruction and the development programme says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acting deputy director-general in the RDP office Bernie Fanaroff agrees that the main trust of the RDP is really about changing the management programme of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minister in charge of reconstruction and development Jay Naidoo adds that changing the management programme of government really amounts to &quot;turning the ship around&quot;. And this he says is a huge task given the fact that the ship has been sailing for around 350 years on a course determined by apartheid impertatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There has had to be planning, new structure have had to be set up to work towards new priorities. We have also had to build consensus in the government of national unity in addition ot shifting the focus of the civil service and reorganizing the Budget,&quot; Naidoo added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the immediate task was to change course, the government has also recognized that it was important to begin implementing the reconstruction and development programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We set up the R2, 5-billion RDP fund because we could not wait till the budget was re-organized in its entirety,&quot; Naidoo says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We needed a fund to leverage changes in the budget and civil service to reflect the RDP priorities. We had to ask ourselves: 'how is the R30- billion in the education budget going ot be spent? What is the quality of expenditure?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In answering these questions, we agreed that the RDP fund had to be used in two ways:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To kick-start major programmes - and that is what we have been working on systematically. We have focused our energies on identifying integrated programmes that arise from what the President spelt out in his State of the Nation address in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second aspect of the way we used the RDP fund was to leverage changes in how expenditure took place in various government departments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The end result of all of this was that government has used the Presidential projects to spearhead a number of important programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the projects mentioned by President Mandela were a free health scheme and school feeding programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fanaroff adds that in identifying projects that should be undertaken, the RDP office took into account the fact that the RDP was really about transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What we have done so far is to have identified projects that will lead to this transition. These include programmes relating to human resource development, urban renewal, rural development and economic restructuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the same time, the national RDP office has taken the Presidential programmes announced earlier this year, and together with a process of consulation with various line ministries and provincial governments, begun identifying projects that will lead to a series of longer term programmes,&quot; he told New Nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While programmes in a number of areas have already been identified, the process of implementation has in itself initiated restructuring in key areas of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most important in this regard has been the process of re-ordering government expenditure. In addition, it has also begun a process of re-ordering the way in which civil service and public sector resources are utilised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process has also set line ministries on a course towards developing long term visions which must find expression in their five-year development strategies and the budget expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What these projects, identified by the RDP office, have acheived,&quot; says Fanaroff, &quot;is that they have started driving the actual process of restructuring the way government operates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Through the process of budgetry allocations, we have also levered changes to the budgetry process,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Money has been levered out of departmental allocations and channelled into projects, some of which have been kick-started with finance from the R2,5-billion RDP fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Naidoo explains saying: &quot; If we put money into building schools or clinics, we would then require the education and health ministers to re-organise their budgets to pay for the running of those schools and clinics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Re-ordering of expenditure would amount to taking money away from funding huge bureaucracies created by apartheid - running empty schools, for example - to make new structures built with the RDP fund functional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If sustained, the process could see the subsequent Budgets reflecting RDP priorities more closely. What will emerge at the end will be a programme-based budget which will make it possible for government to report on progress and assess targets set in terms of the projects undertaken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This has clearly not been the case with the way the past government administered its budget and reflects a mojor change in style of government to one which will clearly find itself having to be more accountable and subject to monitoring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly, Fanaroff is pleased with the way in which expenditure has been re-ordered as a result of the leverage provided by the RDP fund and the Presidential projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether the leverage provided by the fund has succeeded in re-organising the civil service and public sector, however, is doubtful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In part, government has been hamstrung by constitutional restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a lot has been acheived in setting up an infrastructure within government to reflect the new priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Within the government, we have set up the RDP Cabinet Committee,&quot; says Naidoo. Its immediate task is to ensure that all projects undertaken by differernt line departments in government are integrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Its job is to ensure that we all allocate resources from the RDP fund in suchs a way that it leads to integrated programmes.&quot; says Naidoo. In addition, this committee is also expected to monitor and evaluate the government's implementation strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Naidoo, the finance ministry forms a key component of the RDP committee given the fact that the reconstruction and development programme is not simply about spending the R2,5-billion allocated to the RDP fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is, in reality, about how we re-organise the whole of the R135-billion in our budget so that it goes towards meeting the needs of our people.&quot; says Naidoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Illustrating how the RDP fund, along with the Presidential projects, have been employed in redirecting and levering funds at every level in government, Naidoo says: &quot;If you examine the free health care project, for example-that has been linked to a programme to build clinics. At the same time we have linked that up to a campaign to fight Aids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Naidoo goes on to add that the school feeding scheme, for example, should not been seen as simply a nutritional programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By implementing the feeding scheme, says Naidoo, &quot;we are focusing our efforts on the whole campaign to get children back to school and restore the culture of learning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But that in itself has to be linked to a programme of building schools, repairing classrooms, furnishing them and installing electricity as well as setting up democratic school management structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Rather than the Presidential projects being seen as ad hoc isolated events, we have conceptualised them into programmes which are already unfolding,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the area of land reform, a number of pilot projects have been established which go beyond simply land restitution. It also focuses on the development of small and medium sized farming project which could have important spinoffs for the empowerment of women located in rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This process has also impacted on the area of restructuring the way government works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to ensure that projects are located in a co-ordinated programme of growth through development, government has also established interdepartmental task forces to ensure that projects are integrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Naidoo explains that the government cannot afford to implement a housing programme without the Department of Housing liaising with the education and health ministries to decide on where schools and clinics will be located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Setting up these committees has taken a lot of time,&quot; says Naidoo.  But this achievement has not necessarily been projected as something tangible that immediately translates into more houses, schools and clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Naidoo, however, says what the government has acheived to date is the broad allocation of funds into broad programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are now entering the next phase - the final planning and involvement of communities in an actual programme of delivery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked whether this meant that the electorate could look foward to seeing concrete delivery, and tangible changes in areas such as housing, education, health care and job creation, Naidoo said: &quot;Most certainly - with all that we have acheived, we have now reached a stage where we can begin the delivery in a systematic way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He nevertheless cautioned that the programmes government will support will be subjected to a set of strict criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the most important will be community support and committment.  For example, while urban renewal deals with restoring services and upgrading infrastructur, &quot;government will not be able to find sufficient money to acheive this all on its own if people don't pay for services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Therefore, communities in any area we target for upgrading will have to enter into a contract between themselves, the local and provincial government and ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We won't put money into any area where such an agreement does not exist,&quot; Naidoo warned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, August 26-30, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda has been fingered by international human rights organisations as the country wiht one of the highest prisoner death rates in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A just released report by Freedom House, a US human rights organisation, attributed the high Ugandan prison deaths to harsh conditions in the cells, overcrowding, malnutrition and the spread of AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report was presented to eight African journalists from Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Liberia, South Africa and Uganda who are on a comparison study of the USA human rights and press record at the invitation of Freedom House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presenting the report, Senior Scholar in International Communications at Freedom House and Adjunct Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication at New York University, Leonard Sussman said that he hoped &quot; Uganda does not slip further into bad press when the press bill that is before parliment is passed.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When contacted for comment, the Commissioner for Prisons, Joseph Etima, warned the press not to pick an item and &quot;build a mountain in order to sell a paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He insisted the Freedom House report was based on a 1992 United States published Country Human Rights Report which only contained the statement that &quot;Uganda prisons reportedly have one of the highest mortality rates in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That was a distortion of the facts. As for whether there are deaths in prisons, yes there are deaths, but you must take figures to isolate who leads,&quot; Etima said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report titled &quot;Freedom in the World&quot; (1993- 1994) says that equally bad in Uganda are the political rights. It says that the NRM government has persistently worked to undermine the traditional political parties, DP and UPC alleging that the two parties lead to division based on religion, ethnicity and regionalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report highlights the Constitutional Commission's report and the recommendations it made and its tragic end in the death of Prof. Dan Mudhoola on February 20,1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If states that after the commission endorsed a five year extension of NRM, &quot;political parties within Uganda and various exile groups immediately denounced the report as simply incorporating the NRM position.&quot; And accordingly &quot;on 20 Feb 1993, in what was viewed as a possible vendetta by members of a political party, a hand grenade thrown into a party (bar), killed the Commission Vice Chairman Dan Mudhoola.&quot; No party is specifically named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But not all is lost on Uganda. The report says that since 1987, with IMF suggested economic adjustments programs, Uganda has enjoyed one of the highest economic growth rates in Africa, averaging 6% annually. Sadly though the report says; &quot;Nevertheless the country remains one of the poorest in the world, with 1 million AIDS-caused orphans and 2 million AIDS carriers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the human rights record, the report says that Ugandans can not yet change their government democratically. It also says that there are no meaningful balances on executive power and &quot;Museveni enjoys a wide discretion in exercising his political power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judiciary's independence is also questioned. The report says that the judiciary &quot;is circumscribed by direct executive interference in cases involving political opponents of the regime. As for the press, it is a dead end. The report says that the press in Uganda is practicing self-censorship due to the governments attempt to muzzle it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda is listed among 26 African countries with the worst press freedom record in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report does not list the prisoners whom it alleges have died in Ugandan prisons. Perhaps to confirm the message in the report, July 28 a prisoner from Masafu Prison, Wilberforce Wabwire, collapsed and died in a Magistrate's court in Busia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to his inmates, Bwire had been suffering abdominal pains, diarrhorea and was pissing blood the day before he appeared in court for a trial on elopment charges!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just in June local administration police in Mukono district caused the death of an inmate after one and a half years of detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fred Mukisa, who was arrested after a domestic quarrel and later a fight with his wife, had been severely tortured and detained without trial at several local administration police stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police kept Mukisa for a long time to allegedly extort money from his relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Danish Ambassador to Uganda, Thomas Scheerbeck, said while closing a three-day regional conference on Penal Reform Development last Wednesday that human rights situations in Uganda is much better compared to a few years back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a report in Monday's New Vision, the Danish envoy is quoted to have said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I find this (human rights situation ) extremely important, as we all know that it has been bad a few years ago, and that it is not yet good enough, but the important thing is that it is improving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On other issues raised in the Freedom House report, Commissioner Etima who was flanked by two Assistant Commissioners, the Director of Prison Medical Services and the PRO, also said the issue of AIDS was known to everybody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The prisoners we have come from the popluation which is already infected,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He argued that while looking at the conditions of the prisoners, the general conditions of Ugandans should not be lost on us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The conditions of Ugandans generally are also harsh because of economic hardships,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The director of Prisons Medical Services, Dr. D. Nyabwana, maintained that Uganda was far ahead of African countries in health care in prisons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, August 23-26, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malaria is back with a big bang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our news trays are over-flowing with reports of this fresh outburst.  Each of them carries grim tales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unconfirmed reports from Kabale put the death count at over 200. In Kapchorwa, fatalities have shot beyond 100.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ministry of Health seems not to have come to terms with the unfolding tragedy. World Vision, an NGO, was the only organisation that rushed medecines to the malaria death scenes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officially, the Ministry of Health has breathed no word about what they are doing to cope with what looks like it is becoming an epedemic. The public is unlikely to hear from them soon since the top three officials at the ministry were not available for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health experts say decades of civil strife have taken their toll on the health infrastructure. Government, too, for quite sometime has been spending penuts on health, and a very tiny fraction of that on malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If you cause a disarray in your health service, that disarray takes much longer to rebuild. Communities suffer much longer from diseases which were previously under control.&quot; Prof. Gilbert Bukenya who heads Makerere Medical School's Institute of Public Health (IPH) points out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the professor, though NRM's expenditure on health has risen from about two to ten percent of Gross National Product in the last eight years, the impact of this rise cannot compare with the 1960's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currently, the annual percapita budgetry expenditure on health is about Shs. 4,000. In the '60's, government also spent about ten percent of its budget on health but due to the uninterrupted build-up from colonial days, and the smaller population, the effect of this expenditure was more visible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now much of the money goes into the rehabilitation of the infrastructure vandalised in the wars of politicians hunting for power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, because AIDS has become the official No.1 public enemy, though it kills fewer people than malaria, it is nowadays easier to get condoms in an up-country dispensary than chloroquine tablets. Another problem. The sale of drugs on the open market by ignorant traders has encouraged self- treatment. Result? Under-doses of chloroquine, an inexpensive cure, have made malaria parasites resistant. Substitutes life Fansidar and Metakelfin cost Shs. 1,500 upwards per dose. If each member of a family succumbs to malaria every month, it becomes clear that a complete therapy is beyond the means of the average Ugandan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof. Bukenya again. Malaria is a scourge with medical, social, and economic dimensions. Thus even if the health service had all the resources it needs and enough doctors to give quick diagnoses and cures, it would all be ineffective unless the social-economics of malaria and ecological factors get due attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Poor drainage, and the nonenforcement of laws that prohibit planting crops likely ot breed mosquitoes near homes spawn problems. According to the IPH boss a small investment in bed nets is likely to reduce the incidence of malaria by as much as 50 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malaria contributes enormously to underdevelopment because it constitutes enormously to underdevelopment because it constitutes about 40 percent of the national disease burden. World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates put malaria at the head of killer diseases in Uganda. The 1993 figures show that 25 percent of hospital out- patient attendance is malaria-related. Fourteen percent o in-patients are malaria cases and of htose who die, 10 percent are malaria fatalities. Not even AIDS beats that record!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You can blame the weather for the misfortunes of Kapchorwa and Kabale.  These highland areas once had near-temperate climates which checked the spread of malaria. But due to the effects of global warming, temperatures have shot up to levels favourable for mosquitoes and malaria parasites to thrive. The low natural immunity to the disease among the Sabiny and Bakiga partly explains the unprecedented malaria deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the politicians who pull our purse strings hold the real answers to the malaria scourge. A new turn in priorities even within the limits of our budget can nip the new menace in the bud. Short of that more peasants must be prepared to die.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MONITOR, August 12-16, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda has been mentioned as the potential breeding ground for Africa's second dollar billionaire after South Africa's Harry Oppenheimer in an otherwise bleak African economic landscape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the July issue of Forbes - a leading world financial magazine - the Madhvani Group with an annual turnover of over $100 million - up from nothing in 1989, is set for an economic take off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In June the Madhvani and NutraSweet, a division of Monsanto, began producing a blend of cane sugar and aspartame to be marketed throughout East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forbes magazine says the Madhvani's Ugandan enterprises now employ capital of around $200 million and account for about 9 percent of the country's GNP.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It quotes Mayur Madhvani 45, a director of the family's Ugandan interests, as saying sugar production should hit pre-Amin levels of around 70,000 tons in 1995, with volume rising to 130,000 tons by 1988. &quot;At the rate things are going, it's a safe bet that they'll be Uganda's first dollar billionaires - as long as the government holds to its course of economic liberation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the time the despot Idi Amin expelled the Madhvanis and 70,000 other Asians in 1972 the Madhvanis, with assets of around $120 million, controlled more than one-third of the industrial investments in the country.  The center-piece was the Kakira Sugar Works, a 22,000 acre plantation in Jinja. The family also owned a brewery, a candy factory, textile and steel mills and tea estates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After Amin was driven from the country in 1979, the Madhvanis were among the first Asian families to return to Uganda. With help from the World Bank and other lenders, the Madhvanis undertook a $55 million rehabilitation effort. They've also begun rejuvenating their other properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The magazine says that when converted into dollars at prevailing exchange rates, the fortunes of Uganda's Madhvanis, India's Ruias and China's Rongs don't add up to $1 billion a piece. Yet in their respective countries they're much more powerful and may live better - than typical U.S., or European billionaires in their home countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This paradox results from the difference between simple exchange rate conversions and more complicated purchasing power parity, or PPP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In developing countries, most goods and services are cheaper than in the U.S. for instance, a housekeeper in Kampala costs Shs. 15,000($15) per month, but $4.36 per hour in a typical U.S. city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Futures Group, a Glastonbury, Connecticut-based management consulting firm, using purchasing power parties, India's Lalit Mohan Thaper is worth $300 million based on the exchange rate but can buy $1.5 billion worth of Indian goods and services. China's Rongs can buy about $1.5 billion worth, and Uganda's Maldhvanis may be $1.2 billion worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Key elements in Uganda's rather surprising rating are the government's recovery plan: abolishing price controls, establishing a market determined exchange rate, ending currency restrictions, down sizing the army and civil service, and selling off state-owned businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The results: Since 1987, when Museveni began the reforms, economic growth has averaged 5 percent and inflation has fallen from over 200 percent to less than 5 percent. Foreign investors are beginning to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On average however, Forebes magazine says that the prospects for the African continent are not bright. While most of the world had embraced free markets, many African countries still stagnate under corrupt governments that have stifled private enterprise and crippled economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1987 Forbes' first survey of world billionaires included only 6 Latin American billionaires, and 2 of them were cocaine lords, now dead; on this year's list are 42 Latin billionaires; by all appearances, every one is legitimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Excluding Japan, in 1987 Forbes reporters found only 14 Asian billionaires. This year the number is 46.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The developing countries really are emerging, and wealth is accumulating as economic liberalization sweeps the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With at least 24 billionaires, Mexico ranks fourth in the world as a breeding ground for the species, after the U.S., Germany and Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most promising country right now is India, where serious liberalisation is afoot. New billionaires should also emerge in Israel, Eastern Europe as bureaucratic barriers to invest and expand are torn down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the latest issue of the London- published Africa Analysis newsletter says that Uganda could be the first African country to benefit from the large once-for-all cancellations of foreign debt. This follows an agreement between Western leaders meeting at eh recent G7 summit in Naples.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE GHANAIAN CHRONICLE, Thursday, August 4- Sunday, August 7, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 17 articles in the code provide a frame of reference to the National Executive and the Disciplinary Committee as well as members of the association when it becomes necessary to initiate disciplinary action against a member who flouts any articles of the code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to its preamble, the code is meant to ensure that members of GJA adhere to the highest ethical standards, professional competence and good behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The preamble states that as the fourth estate of the realm, the public expect the media to play its watchdog role, adding it should do this with a high sense of responsibility, professional integrity, plagiarism, respect for privacy and human dignity, separating comments from facts, rejoinders and headlines and sensationalism, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under people's right to true information, the code reaffirms that &quot;the duty of every journalist is to write and report the truth bearing in mind his duty to serve the public,&quot; adding the public have the right to unbiased , accurate, balanced and comprehensive information as well as express themselves freely through the media.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It stresses that a journalist should make adequate inquiries and cross-check his facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The code states under professional integrity that &quot; a journalist should not accept bribe or any form of inducement to influence the performance of his professional duties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It points out under &quot;plagiarism&quot; that a journalist should not plagiarize, because it is unethical and illegal, and advises that where there is the need to use other's material, &quot;it is proper to credit the sources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On respect for privacy and human dignity, the code calls on journalists to respect the right of the individual to privacy and human dignity, and emphasises that inquiries and intrusions into a person's private life can only be justified when done in public interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It warns journalists to guard against defamation, libel, slander and obscenity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The code advises journalists not to originate material which encourages discrimination on grounds of ethnicity, colour, creed, gender or sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The code enjoins journalists to protect confidential sources of information, but advises that &quot;under no circumstance should news or a publication be surpressed unless it borders on national security or it is in the public interest to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On rejoinders, the code says an opportunity for rejoinders should be given to individuals or organisations, stressing that any report or write-up affecting the reputation of an individual or organisation without a chance of reply is unfair and must be avoided by journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said that while journalists are free to take positions on any issue they should draw a clear line between comment, conjecture and fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the code advises journalists to avoid identifying victims of sexual assault. They should protect the rights of minors in criminal and other cases and secure the consent of parent or guardians before interviewing or photographing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The code states: &quot;newspaper headlines should be fully warranted by the contents of the articles they accompany&quot;, stressing that photographs and telecasts should give an accurate picture of an event and not highlight an incident out of context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Consultative Committee (NCC) which approves national policy and programmes of the association ratified the code of ethics at its meeting which formed part of the three-day seminar organised by the association in co-operation with Freidrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) on &quot;the state of the media&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NCC agreed that members who flout the code of ethics should not be allowed to hold office in the association and should not be allowed to participate in the media awards competition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAILY OBSERVER, August 2, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The overthrow of the 30- year-old People's Progressive Party government marks the end of an era in Africa's post-colonial politics. Until 22nd July 1994, Sir Dawda Jawara was the last surviving member of the dwindling group of godfathers who led Africa from the gambling house of colonialism and began the continent's long search for democracy and social justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the coup against Tafawa Balewa in the early 1960s, most West African countries have gone from one military regime to another. Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea Conakry and Togo are all under military regimes or soldier-turned- politician regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are several reasons why soldiers intervene in politics. These include corruption, mismanagement of state resources, the dominance of state power by one ethnic group or in some cases interference by a super power. The anti-Nkrumah coup in Ghana was a combination of all these factors. The coup makers said corruption and the PPP's dictatorial character had been their motivating factor. but Ghanaians were later to learn that the US Central Intelligence Agency had plotted and financed the coup against Osagyefo Dr.  Kwame Nkrumah.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coups in Africa or the Third World are described or classified as rhetoric, proclamations or initial actions of the coup makers. Coups are either rightwing, because they are against a progressive or radical ruler (such as the anti-Nkrumah coup in 1966), leftwing (such as that of Thomas Sankara in Burkina Faso), or simply nationalistic. The Nasser coup in Egypt, Col. Gadafi's coup in Libya, Numeri's in Sudan and Gen. Murtala in Nigeria fall under the radical mode. It should also be noted that some coups which start as radical or leftwing can become rightwing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why Coups Take Place</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Latin America and most Third World countries radical coups occur for several reasons, the most important being the question of political power. Lenin, the foremost theoretician on state power, once said that &quot;the bourgeoisie maintains itself in power not only by force, but also by virtue of the lack of class consciousness and organisation, the routinism and downtrodden state of the masses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the often stated reasons for coups point to corruption, there are more pertinent reasons for their occurrence. The late Rith First, a former member of FRELIMO, argued that coups &quot;occur because governments are too weak to rule but radical forces are to weak to take power. Referring to the 1951 coup against King Farouk, a social scientist observed that &quot;when the old rulers are no longer able to hold power, the middle classes are to weak to seize, and the working class not yet matured to the task, officers fill the vacuum which has been formed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In general, social scientists have identified several reasons or conditions for a coup: the presence of a nationalistic elite, sometimes (pro-western) unable to carry out social reforms; the inability of a government to solve social crisis or problems; dissatisfaction of the elite with an inert or archaic regime; and the inefficiency of a civilian government normally bolstered by corruption and the disappointment to the masses. Other factors include foreign interference (especially against nationalistic pan African leaders); ethnic oriented coups and coups in which imperialist conflicts are fought out by proxy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The factors enumerated above also lead us to two main distinctions between coups of a progressive character and reactionary (pro-imperialist coups).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Progressive Coups</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In terms of rhetoric, radical coups tent to promise to restructure society, are anti-imperialist and nationalistic in ideology and often tend to be against the ruling class. Radical coup makers also mobilise the oppressed and exploited segments of society in the days of the cold war, most radical coups looked to the Soviet Union for support and legitimacy. In the same way, a regimes ideological character was also gauged by its attitude towards either the Soviet Union or to the United States. The Sankara coup in Burkina Faso mobilised radical workers and peasants, was anti-imperialist, and promised to reclaim the wealth of Burkina Faso. Nasser, Numeiri and Gaddafi tried to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gamal Abdul Masser, in his Philosophy of the Revolution, argued that his progressive coup was necessary because &quot;the state of affairs...singled out the army as the force to do the hob...this situation demanded the existence of a force set in a cohesive framework, far removed from the conflict between individuals and classes, and drawn from the heart of the people, a with enough materials strength at its disposal to guarantee swift and decisive action. These conditions could be met only by the army.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Radical coups by their nature are carried out by a combination of soldiers and some radical groups or tend to rely on the mobilisation of the masses: workers, peasants and some sections of the middle classes. The coup of 21st October 1969 in Somalia was carried out by a alliance of soldiers and students. Such coups rely on such mobilisation to legitimize the regime and to reassure the deprived sections of the population that it can be trusted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In essence, the democratisation of political power and the interruption of capitalist development in favour of the development of local productive forces and enabling people to participate in the decision making process is what distinguishes a progressive coup from all others. To achieve this, the coup must have a democratic and popular content. As noted by earlier theoreticians on military regimes, &quot;the progressive orientation of a military regime depends on the development of democracy and on the broader and broader participation of the masses in economical, social and cultural reconstruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reactionary Coups</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In contrast, the anti-Nkrumah coup of 1966 was pro-imperialist, anti-socialist and sought to reverse the nationalistic policies of the CPP regime. The coup of Master Sergeant Doe and Captain Strasser in Sierra Leone are either nationalistic or basically rightwing and therefore could be described as reactionary in ideology. Reactionary groups tend to stray towards consolidating the power of the bureaucracy, maintaining the status quo and are generally pro- imperialist or to be more specific, pro-American.  For these rulers, it is always business as usual. Not many coup makers subscribe to rightwing ideology from the day of the coup, even though their actions would tend to take that route to development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One feature of reactionary coups is the class character of the regimes. They tend to be made up of senior army officers who dislike the old regimes precisely because it is nationalistic or simply because they have been denied a share of the national cake. A Ghanaian coup leader once said that the reason for his coup was because the army had been &quot;denied even the most basic amenities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another development worth noting is the rise of young, radical and nationalistic army officers such as the late Thomas Sankara, Rawlings (in the late 1970s), Blaise Campaore and Captain Strasser. These officers tend to blame old politicians for Africa's socio- economic problems. Leaders like Thomas Sankara tended to side with radical students, youth movements, grassroots organizations for support in their quest for power. It is therefore always tempting to classify these army officers as radicals even though their actions have ultimately suggested that they were mere power seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is always tempting to take a simplistic approach in classifying to analysing military regimes in Africa. Society is complex, and there are always social or economic reasons that influence and properly coup makers.  Western intellectuals and Embassy officials tend to listen to the public pronouncements of coup makers or leaders. The important thing is to look beyond what they say in public and to look at the class character of coup makers. The social forces they mobilise in the first few days, their supporters and the reaction of the public to the coup as a whole. That would explain the potential difference in pronouncements and the actions of coup makers in the history of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Contrary to popular beliefs, coups do not need lost of men to succeed.  Because they happen when governments are weak because of their failure to fulfill people's ambitions, and has therefore lost popularity, they are unable to mobilise resistance. Most of the time, coup makers face apathy, curiosity or sometimes, open jubilation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Banjul Quintet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So what do we make of the Banjul Quintet who now constitute the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council?  So far, the pronouncements of the AFPRC, leaders of the 22nd July coup in The Gambia, have not said much. The broadcast announcing the overthrow of the 30 year old Jawara regime promised a &quot;new era of freedom, progress, democracy and accountability.&quot; subsequently, the coup leader new ruler of The Gambia, Lt. Yaya A.J.J. Jammeh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike other coup makers in West Africa, the new leaders have refrained from making wild statements and promises. It is difficult to say what the end result of such causation will be. However, at this stage, the ideological orientation of the coup is still not clear. That also points to the fact that in the aftermath of the cold way, coup makers (leaders) are not under pressure to woo one super power or the other to please.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the talk of &quot;free market&quot; would also suggest that the AFPRC regime does not intend to make a radical departure from the economic orientation of the PPP government and is like to please the business class and of course some western countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the issue of accountability is where the new regime can make a difference. The PPP government was caught up in its own internal contradictions and class interests. As a result, it could not and was never in a position to confront the issue of corruption in a radical or forthright manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The legal battles between the Assets Recovery Management Committee and some local businessmen, and the failure of the government to respond to calls for a probe into the state of affairs at the African Center for Democracy and Human Rights are just two examples of the government's weakness and inability to address the question of corruption in the Gambia society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These issues, coupled with the rising poverty in the country, would suggest that the coup makers lived in a country that was ready for explosion.  It was only a matter of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Promise to Keep</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Daily Observer's editorial, &quot;A Promise to Keep,&quot; noted quite rightly that &quot;the military in Africa do not have a track record of fulfilling the lofty ideals for which they say they seize power. Instead, the people experience more suffering, most often far worse than before. And because the military rules with guns, the people remain helpless victims of perennial hegemony and suppression.&quot; That summarizes the relationship between the military and civil society in Africa in recent times and is based on concrete reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's relationship with military rule always starts on a happy note and ended sourly. The recent debacle in Nigeria, Rawlings' present relationship with Ghanaians, and Eyadema's ongoing problems attests to the above statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One reason for this is the nature of the military. Numerous references have been made to then the colonial character of Africa's military. It has been noted that because of the ideological orientation of the military, it has no democratic content and can therefore not be expected to reinforce and promote democracy in Africa. The fallacy of this argument is that there are examples of military regimes being more democratic than their civilian counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it is also true that coups by their nature are conspiratorial activities, and tend to rely on a few trusted officers and men in the army to succeed. But their continued survival depends on the support of the broad masses and their initial actions. No single coup follows a particular pattern, and so it would be an exercise in folly to look for this in the events on 22nd July in the Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Either by fate of design, the only surviving multi-party democracy of the old mold has also fallen to the gun. It is a sad reflection of Africa politics that political differences have always to be resolved in the end by the gun. However, in the case, the AFPRC has avoided bloodshed, and Gambians can only hope that this becomes one of the most peaceful takeovers in African history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maybe, the Banjul Quintet should take a leaf from the history books and avoid the excesses of others. Most coup leaders in West Africa have fallen to the same temptations of the predecessors. In the end, military rulers always become more affluent, more corrupt, more despotic, more undemocratic than the civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Examples abound in Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Nigeria, Sudan, etc., etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AFPRC should perhaps rely on the creative energies of the Gambian people, listen less to foreign advisers, with a double agenda (especially those form powerful western countries), and listen more to Gambian opinion, especially the cries of the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is one area where the PPP government failed woefully. Their abiding class interest alienated that majority of ordinary Gambians. Their narrow selfish interests, narrow visions and surprising lack of creativity created a wide gulf between them and the general population. The loud talk of transforming The Gambia into a Singapore was as unrealisable dream of the most absurd proportions and lacked anything concrete to back the claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Above all, the PPP's failure to address the question of poverty in a concrete manner was an historical indictment. Child malnutrition, malaria, food shortage and the state of deprivation of urban Gambia should have been a source of concern to the PPP big shots. Perhaps it was, but the reality of today suggests otherwise, and we will never know, the most pressing problem of Gambians today is therefore poverty. How the AFPRC regime addresses this will distinguish it from the PPP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There will be many sycophants and many midnight adversaries. Some of those who led the PPP government along the road to disaster, and are now hiding in the closet will soon re-emerge. There will be many businessmen working round the clock to but favours, turn their support and 'donations' from the non- existent PPP to the AFPRC. How the new rulers either succumb to these temptations or avoid them will test their commitment to democracy, transparency, accountability and their commitment to the broad masses of Gambian workers and peasants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Will the AFPRC be different from all the others? The world is watching. The Banjul Quintet has sounded new notes in Gambia's musical chairs. Will the song be different from the one Gambians heard in the last 30 years? Will the new song be receptive to Gambian ears?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAILY OBSERVER, Wednesday, August 3, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to this Act shall be obligated or expended to finance directly any assistance to any country whose duly elected head of Government is deposed by military coup or decree: provided, that assistance may be resumed to such country if the President determines and reports to the Committees on Appropriations that subsequent to the termination of assistance a democratically elected government has taken office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This citation of Section 508 of Fund Assistance Appropriations Act 1994 of Public Law 103-87 of the USA was made by Rose Marie Depp, USAID representative to The Gambia, in an interview with the Daily Observer following the military takeover of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Depp explained that it is beyond her control to persuade the US government to approve new aid obligations or commitments to the Gambia under the military regime.  The above quotation, she added, is not just a policy but a law in America, and all countries small or large under military rule are regarded and treated the same way.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She revealed that the only exemptions in this case are made for countries suffering from a natural disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the question of stopping USAID's operations in The Gambia, she aid that so far she has not received any communication from Washington to terminate any of her staff or cease operations.  Mrs. Depp added that even if they were to do so, they would have to look at each component of every single project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She revealed that since independence the USAID increased its annual development fund to The Gambia form $6 million to $10 million in 1994.  The reason for the increase, she said, was due mainly to the good economic policy reform record and the democratic and human rights records in The Gambia.  The USAID representative said that the Washington Office has closed 21 missions of USAID across the world, nine of which were in Africa.  All these were countries which came under military rule where USAID had its operations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> USAID, since 1979 when it started sending permanent representatives to the Gambia, has sent five people here: Tom Moser, Byron Bahl, Jimmie Stone, Bonnie Pounds and Rose Marie Depp.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEEKEND OBSERVER, July 29-31, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United States Ambassador Andrew J. Winter has been explaining how he helped President Dawda K. Jawara to leave the country on the morning of the military take-over that toppled the government of the People's Progressive Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Winter was asked by this newspaper how it happened that at the propitious moment when the coup d'etat was fast unfolding, he happened to be in the right place-- State House-- at the right time-- Friday morning-- to rescue the Gambian leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He explained that he had accompanied Reubin Bookert, the Captain of the visiting US naval vessel, Lamoure County , to pay a courtesy call on the then Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defense, Mr. Bun Jack.  Mr.  Jack's office is located on the first floor of State House, just next to the office of the Vice President, who was also Minister of Defense in the Jawara government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When we got to the corridor leading to the vice President's office,&quot; said the ambassador, &quot; the door flung open and Vice President Sabally appeared and asked us in. He then told us that he had just received word that there was a problem with troops at the Yundum barracks of the Gambia National Army.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Incidentally, a contingent of the GNA had been scheduled on Saturday, July 23, to engage in training exercises with naval officers from the ship.  That is why in the early hours of the coup, many ruled out any trouble because they thought it was all part of the scheduled training exercises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While I and the ship captain were in the Vice President's office, Sabally excused himself to go and see the President. Ten minutes later he returned and requested that we take him and the President to the ship for safekeeping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The captain and I concurred and proceeded with Mr. Sabally downstairs. I then moved my car backward toward State House, and awaited the President. He, Lady Chilel, several children, grandchildren, and personal security and servants emerged from the State House. It was suggested that for security reasons, President Jawara would ride in my car. I took the front passenger seat and he took the back seat. And with security escort, we proceeded to the Port of Banjul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ambassador said there were 47-49 Gambians aboard the ship, most of the family members. Finance and Economic Affairs Minister B.B. Dabo came later. He was the only cabinet minister apart from the Vice President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked what happened to the President's other wife, Lady Njaimeh, Mr.  Winter said she did not return with the President from London the previous day, Thursday, when he returned from a six week trip abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As we received reports that the troops were entering Banjul,&quot; the Ambassador continued, &quot; the captain and I decided to set sail. We went to the mouth of the harbour and could still see the dock. Then we moved the ship to a position opposite the State House to see what was going on. We had no military intentions whatsoever,&quot; he assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He continued, &quot;Then we got word from the Gambia National Army to please move the ship from opposite State House. So, we moved south, about two miles out, off the coast to Cape St. Mary, and sat for a long while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; W e spent the night at that location. We didn't leave Gambian waters until around 1-2 o'clock Sunday afternoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, according to the Ambassador, four crew members of the ship had gone down to Kunkujang where a Catholic priest runs an orphanage, &quot;and we wanted them back on the ship. They made their way to the embassy beach house in Tangie, accompanied by some embassy staff, and spent the night there. Finally, they made their way to the Ambassador's residence in Fajara on Saturday by road on the beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And with the kind assistance of the GNA, we got permission to send a small boat from the ship to Banjul, which took them back to the ship.&quot; Mr.  Winter went on, &quot;We then requested permission for me to go ashore. Permission was granted. But by that time, it was 7pm, after the curfew time. And as I started out for the beach, the GNA called to say they could not guarantee my safety because they couldn't make contact with the GNA personnel patrolling on the beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Therefore, on Sunday, at about 1pm, the Bolong Kanta, a patrol boat which the US government gave the Gambia government, rendezvoused with the LaMoure County and took me and two members of my staff. The GNA granted us safe conduct through Banjul to the embassy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That same Sunday,&quot; the Ambassador said, &quot;the ship left for Dakar, where President Abdou Diouf granted Sir Dawda asylum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, September 9, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A RESERVE BANK masterplan has caused currency speculators to burn their fingers and lose billions of rands betting against the rand over the past couple of months.  Governor Chris Stals this week laughed at speculators who had put wagers on the commercial rand continuing its headlong slide against the dollar as pressure mounted for the bank to scrap the financial rand dual currency system.  The finrand, as it is known, protects the reserves of the country by sterilising outflows of foreign capital.  Non-residents who invest in South Africa use these special rands, a pool of which has been created by foreigners disinvesting. While non-residents should find the cheaper finrand attractive, it has many disadvantages, not the least of which is that inflows of money via this route do not build up the capital in the country, but only soak up the outflow of capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stals also issued a warning to the speculators: &quot;Nobody is going to force the bank to scrap the financial rand before the right conditions exist, especially now that our reserves are on the rise again and the market is flush with dollars.  &quot;We are making profits in our dealings in foreign exchange markets at the moment while they are losing money. The financial rand exchange rate must first come towards that of the commercial rand and not the other way round.  In that way there will be less room for speculators and the pain ordinary South Africans will have to bear when the finrand goes will be reduced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stals said the bank had anticipated an outflow of short-term capital in the months leading up to the April election which would result in a sharp depreciation in the value of the rand against the dollar and other currencies.  These outflows would stabilise after the election, resulting in the rand gaining value against the dollar.  &quot;We could have done nothing and allowed a sharp fall in the currency's value which would be followed by a sharp appreciation after the election. Instead, we decided to supply the market with dollars before the election and buy them back after the election to smooth out expected volatile fluctuations in the rand's value during the transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Between end-August and May 10, the bank borrowed dollars worth R7,4-billion to prop up the rand, but the currency still depreciated sharply against the dollar. The fall would have been much sharper had the bank not intervened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We could have been wrong, but the plan worked out quite well because short-term capital outflows have receded and reserves are rising again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are now net buyers of dollars and have repaid loans worth R4-billion. The currency has stabilised again -- around R3,56 -- R3,60 against the dollar - - over the past two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Those who bought forward contracts at R3,70c have burnt their fingers. These people are the ones who are saying the bank must allow the currency to fall. But how can we do this if there are surplus dollars on the market?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stals said a repeat of the situation where international speculator George Soros broke the Bank of England's back and pocketed Stg 1-billion was unlikely to happen in South Africa.  The difference was that in 1992, the Bank of England had decided to fix their currency against the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) and refused to budge even when all economic fundamentals said the pound could not be fixed at such a high level. Speculative pressures built up and the bubble popped in September 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Reserve Bank does not fix the price of the rand or have targets for it. We only lean against the wind smoothing out undue fluctuations in the currency's value. If economic fundamentals are really against the rand we let it go.&quot; Stals hit back at economists who were calling for a sharp depreciation in the value of the rand to boost exports and prevent a balance of payments (BoP) crisis. Simplistically, the BoP shows how much in credit or debt the country is with the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This will result in a short-term improvement in the BoP position as the value of exports increase faster than import prices are rising. But the gains for exporters will be wiped out very quickly by rising inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We estimate every 10 percent depreciation in the value of the rand will increase the inflation rate by 1,5 percent. Other knock-on effects in the domestic market, like higher wage demands, will result in a spiral of further rises in the inflation rate and inflationary expectations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the possibility of an interest rate hike, Stals said many economic indicators (including the rate of inflation and the rate of growth of the money supply and credit extended by the banks) were moving in the wrong direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The pressure is building up, but we have not yet reached the stage where bank rate will have to increase.&quot; The bank rate, set by the Reserve Bank, is the key interest rate which determines all other short-term interest rates.  The bank was watching with interest developments in money and capital markets where rates were rising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;So far the pressure in these markets is not enough to make us increase bank rate, even though some banks are complaining that an increase is needed to improve their interest margins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will look at how much they are borrowing from us. At this stage it is only R2-billion to R3- billion a day. If our rate is too low they will borrow more and only if the figure rises to about R6-billion to R8-billion will we be forced to increase bank rate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stals said there was no timeframe for scrapping the financial rand.  The country was moving in the right direction which would make it easier for the bank to recommend a removal of the dual currency system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The exchange rate had stabilised</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Foreign exchange reserves were increasing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Arrangements were being made for South Africa to receive a credit rating and borrow overseas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Long-term interest rates had already discounted the ending of the finrand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Short- term capital outflows were improving</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Soon long term outflows would follow suit and maybe, in 18 months, foreign direct investment would start arriving</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are moving in the direction that the shocks to the economy (when the finrand was abolished) would be reduced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the country's growth prospects during the transition, Stals said he was optimistic.  &quot;This year there will be not much more than two percent growth. Hopefully, we will be able to gradually solve the structural problems in the economy and raise our medium and long term growth potential. These structural adjustments will happen over time -- some are already happening in the clothing and textiles industries -- and not in one big bang package from the IMF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;South Africa's problems are not as great as those of countries like Argentina which had an inflation rate of 200 percent and a growth rate of -5 percent. These countries had no choice but to make their adjustments in one big bang.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tokyo Sexwale, PWV premier, replies to criticism of his attack on the press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, September 9, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YOU strike a journalist, you strike a rock. Journalists are understandably touchy about their freedom to express themselves. Politicians, too, are touchy about attempts at character assassination and dissemination of disinformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lets put a few things on record:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * A democratic media is an institution within a democratic society. It should serve to enhance democracy and proper ethics; it should function as the conscience of society</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * As a member of the ANC and ANC chairperson in the PWV, I abide by and defend all the movements policies and decisions on media freedom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The ANC has fought harder than any other political party in this countrys history for the right of journalists to express their views without hindrance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The ANC has always believed that media freedom is a cornerstone of democracy. Consequently, in the Bill of Rights chapter of the Interim Constitution, the ANC committed itself to ensuring that every individual should have the right to freedom of speech and expression, which includes freedom of the media</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Our own reconstruction and development programme asserts that open debate and transparency in government and society are crucial elements of reconstruction and development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We believe the media -- like government, labour, business and other players -- has a vital role to play in ensuring the success of the RDP; in other words, in ensuring a better quality of life for all South Africans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We also fully endorse the sentiments expressed by President Mandela this week, when he stressed that we do not expect or want a media which is uncritical or given to praise-singing. As he said: We know too well from our past experience that robust and honest exchange of opinion and criticism are necessary to be truly democratic and for any government to stay on course</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Finally, we believe that the right to reply is a vital element of freedom of expression</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only when you offer the right to reply as a principle will you be able to talk about freedom of expression -- and freedom of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because true freedom of expression, and truund the clock to rever shine!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the media is to reflect the diverse views of our society, the question of media ownership -- and access to the media -- must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What this also means is that the media must vigorously criticise one another too -- no hanky- panky or false camaraderie to cover one anothers backs. Let the debate be open. It must analyse its own actions, its own attitudes, just as vigorously as it critiques the actions and attitudes of politicians. After all, no one is beyond reproach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the heart of the current debate is the fact that a tiny, wealthy liberal movement continues to control and manipulate some of the largest public voices in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They use their resources to advocate a liberal agenda. And, unfortunately, what this results in is a situation where these newspapers are often unable to reflect the cultural diversity, views and aspirations of the majority of our people -- despite the valiant efforts of individual journalists on those newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Something has to be done!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A couple of other points:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We do not believe harsh criticism of a particular editor or journalist constitutes an attack on the media. It is in direct response to the way that editor or journalist covers a particular issue -- in a distorted manner, aimed at disinforming society</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * No one is beyond reproach. No editor or journalist can ever hide behind the rock of press freedom and think that rock is holy. No one should distort the truth in the name of press freedom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In conclusion: we realise that taking criticism is all part of our job. Entering politics is, in itself, extending an open invitation to the world to criticise, lambaste, lampoon and scrutinise every single aspect of ones life -- we welcome this. But the same goes for other public jobs -- editors and journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But cowboys dont cry. And good editors have thick skins, not egg membranes. When one is in a leadership position such as we are, we expect to come under the media spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But theres a line of honesty to be drawn -- and when someone crosses that line, as we think some journalists have done in the past few weeks, we believe we have the right to hit back. Not because we are politicians. Not because we are members of the ANC or any other party. Not because we are premiers, or hold any other position -- but because we are ordinary citizens, entitled to our constitutional rights, for which we have fought long and hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So no one should be surprised when ordinary citizens get tired of having their name tarnished, or the truth about their activities distorted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when he or she does, remember one thing: we are not in the business of arresting, banning or hanging journalists. We just believe we should expose those who distort the truth or try to mislead society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let us equally highlight all freedoms in our Bill of Rights, and not only those that favour us.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, September 9, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RELATIONS between the government and sections of the media are at a relatively low ebb, President Nelson Mandela said this week in a special address to newspaper editors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its a surprising view, because the South African media has never enjoyed as much freedom and as much protection as it has since the April election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although many restrictive laws remain on the books, these are being effectively ignored; attempts by some government departments, such as defence, to restrict and manipulate the press are falling flat; there is a livelier, more open political exchange than this country has ever seen (consider an editor mocking the PWV premier as His Regional Highness, the premier calling him a liar in response and the editor then dismissing the provincial leader as an excitable fellow).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides all of this, the media has Bill of Rights protection which, though not as strong as had been hoped for, still allows more freedom of expression than ever before.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Mandela himself this week said the ANC would support moves to strengthen this clause in the Bill of Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So whats the problem?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is that only part of what the ANC is saying about the media is being heard. The flourishing rhetoric is drowning out what is probably the more important part of the governments message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are those ANC leaders who are issuing thinly veiled threats against counter-revolutionary media that undermines the reconstruction and development programme and is overly critical of the new government. This is what has caused the scare and the exchange of insults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But behind the rhetorical flourishes lies another message, being given in a more sober and reflective way by key ANC leaders such as Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is this: the media, that great champion of change, has itself not gone through the kind of change one would have expected. Mandela this week outlined three problems he sees with the media:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Ownership -- not only concentrated in a few hands, but reflects the patterns of racial exclusion characteristic of the old era</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Demographic composition of management, editorial executives and senior journalists which mirrors the same pattern</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Broader socio-economic issues, such as illiteracy and language constraints which limit the ability of the majority to exercise their freedom of expression</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not really surprising that these issues have had less attention than the dog-fighting. Mandela did, after all, raise some tough and difficult issues that the newspaper world in particular has been slow to deal with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The industry is still dominated by a few large players who tend to think alike. The post-1990 era has seen the closure of newspapers and other publications -- Vrye Weekblad, New African, Work in Progress, Sunday Star -- reducing the diversity of voices and increasing the dominance of the few strong players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The major newspaper groups also tragically and short-sightedly neglected journalistic training during the 1980s, leaving a criticial shortage of fresh, young journalists with the skills and talent to lead a transformation of the industry. An indication of this is that this newspaper, a relatively small one, did more training in the late 1980s than both the two major English-language newspaper groups put together. The response of the big groups was simply to poach emerging talent rather than try and develop it themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking off the cuff, Mandela said the problem came down to one of credibility. Did an industry with the shape and structure of the South African media have the popular credibility so important to it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact of the matter is that the industry is still overwhelmingly dominated by newspapers and journalists who spent the 1970s and 1980s abusing the liberation movements, supporting the tricameral system and doing deals with the defence force which had the effect of containing sensitive information. Many of these individuals and organisations are now born-again freedom fighters, quick to proclaim their contribution to the struggle. But little of this holds water outside their own newsrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela and Mbeki have raised real issues for newspapers. The question now is whether these will be treated as seriously as some of the more provocative utterances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the ANC is also not in a position to simply point fingers. Its own communication has been poor, and so things it is saying and thinking are not getting across. It failed to see the gravy train issue emerging as a problem, and has since dealt with it in a confused and half-baked way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Insiders say that there is real bewilderment in ANC leadership about this issue, and real bitterness being expressed towards the media. It is a case of the ANC blaming the media for its own problem in handling the issue poorly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new government has inherited a huge structure in the South African Communication Services, which spends hundreds of millions of rands ostensibly communicating between the government and the people. If the message is not getting through, this is surely where blame must start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is also lumping all media and all newspapers together.  Different media have different functions -- some, like national television, have public service obligations; others, like independent newspapers, have different duties to their readers. Mandelas and Mbekis statements miss this subtlety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And if the ANC is unhappy with the range of media diversity, why is it not doing more in government to encourage and enhance new and different voices? It could divert the millions being spent by SACS on propaganda publications of dubious merit into promoting media diversity through an independent body such as the Independent Media Diversity Trust, which is battling with a shortage of funds to promote and encourage new and different voices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It could also speed up the work of the Independent Broadcast Authority to bring new voices on to the airwaves. Broadcasting Minister Pallo Jordan said this week that the IBA should speed up its work, but not a lot is being done to pressure this body to move more quickly to open the door to aspirant broadcasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the ANC could be more consistent in its own media policies. If Mandela wants to see more diversity in media ownership, why did his party say or do nothing about the Argus newspapers latest purchases of the Cape Times, Natal Mercury and Pretoria News, which increased their dominance in three cities to an insurmountable monopoly?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC stayed silent. It isnt because the man responsible, Tony OReilly, the new Irish owner of Argus Newspapers, is Mandelas personal friend, is it?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, September 9, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NATIONAL Minister of Safety and Security Sydney Mufamadi faces a showdown with the Inkatha Freedom Party in his bid to root out suspected hit squad policemen from the kwaZulu Police (KZP) force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Developments pointing to this are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * kwaZulu/Natal premier Frank Mdlalose and his provincial safety and security minister, Celani Mthethwa, have rejected any suggestion that they co- operate with the official hit squad investigation appointed by Mufamadi last week;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi has issued a veiled threat that he will quit the government of national unity (GNU) over the hit squad probe; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * controversial former KZP Sundumbili station commander Major Owen Zama has challenged Mufa-madis constitutional right to suspend him in the Durban Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zamas challenge suggests that suspected hit squad members will put up a fight to remain in the force -- and Mufamadi may have to resort to long, drawn-out court battles as a way to oust the policemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The station commander has brazenly defied Mufamadi by continuing to serve in his post -- and is receiving his full salary and benefits. Mufamadis spokesman, Craig Kotze, said this was being done for humanitarian reasons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In papers before Mr Justice Levinsohn last week, Zama argued that Mufamadi lacked the authority to suspend him as, in terms of the kwaZulu Police Act, only the kwaZulu cabinet had such power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the kwaZulu cabinet no longer exists, the KZP remains intact pending the passage of the new Police Bill through parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mufamadi has to prove that the interim constitution gives him or the cabinet power to act against Zama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Levinsohn has asked legal representatives of the two parties to prepare heads of argument so he can determine whether Mufamadi has the authority to suspend Zama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zama is mentioned in a Transitional Executive Council report on hit squads dated March 31 this year, in which his involvement in an attack last year on ANC supporters in Sundumbili, Northern Natal, is alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was suspended in July after Natals attorney general, Tim McNally, decided to prosecute him for allegedly defeating the ends of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Mufamadi attempts to clean up the KZP, he also faces stiff opposition from the IFP majority in the kwa-Zulu/Natal government, and from Buthelezi at central government level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked whether he would co-operate with the probe into KZP hit squads, Mdlalose replied: No, certainly not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mthethwa commented similarly: How can you co- operate with something you are not involved in?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mufamadi announced a commission of inquiry last week, headed by former Goldstone Commission investigator Lieutenant Frank Dutton, to investigate alleged KZP hit squads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mufamadis decision followed fresh claims by retired KZP commissioner General Roy During in July that he was almost certain of the existence of hit squads in the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mthethwa said that while Mufa-madi had publicly announced he would be consulted about the commission, he had merely been informed about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail reported earlier this year that the Goldstone Commission had information Mthethwa had received weapons for the IFP from renegade South African policemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mthethwas name also featured during a recent bail application by the former commander of the SAPs Vlakplaas hit squad base, Major Eugene de Kock, where it was alleged that the two had contact with each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kotze said if the IFP, as an institution, refuses to co-operate it is one thing, but if individuals (refuse) then the law will take its course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked whether this meant action would be taken against Mthethwa if he refused to testify, Kotze replied: We cant conjure what might happen before it happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a bid to halt the hit squad probe, Buthelezi sent a letter on August 19 to both Mufamadi and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki warning that the inquiry would force him to weigh up the value of my being in the GNU against the costs of being in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arguing that Mufamadis decision was beyond comprehension as it could upset brittle relations between the ANC and IFP, Buthelezi said it was unfair to single out the KZP -- one of 11 police forces in the country -- for a probe. He believed normal procedures should be used to investigate allegations against KZP members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked by the WM&amp;G whether he intended to resign in the wake of Mufamadis decision to go ahead with the inquiry, Buthelezi replied: ... I wish to state that if and when the time is ripe, I will do so and it will be at the right time for the right reasons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, August 25 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lionel N'gakane has the sort of deep, authoritative voice you would expect to hear on the stage -- he trained as an actor in London, as a way into making films. He's come back, permanently, as the Southern African regional secretary of the Pan- African Federation of Filmmakers (Fepaci), a founding member of the recently established South African Film Foundation -- whose festival begins late next month -- and a director of the educational Film Resources Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> N'gakane loves film. His greatest desire is to see a flourishing film industry in the Southern</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African region. And no, not political films: &quot;I think the days of politically orientated films are over,&quot; he says. &quot;Now we should talk about our history, make films about the human condition, the everyday drama of people, and I think, sophisticated comedies, good comedies.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The task is gigantic. But after a lifetime in film, he's not daunted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, he didn't intend to be a filmmaker. In the early Fifties, he worked on Zonk -- the first black magazine -- fell out with them, went to start Drum and was sent to interview Zoltan Korda, then in South Africa filming Alan Paton's classic, Cry, the Beloved Country. Korda offered him a job, but Drum's manager wasn't keen on the idea, so N'gakane left after two issues and went with the film unit to London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There were two film schools, one in Russia, one in Italy, and I couldn't afford either.&quot; So he became an actor (stage, radio and television), managed to buy a camera, began experimenting, made a documentary, Vukani/Awake, about apartheid -- the first documentary on the subject by a black filmmaker -- made a feature film, Jemima and Johnny, about racism in London and how it affects two children. The film cost Stg 5 000 -- Peter Sellers helped with money -- won prizes at international film festivals from Italy to Tunisia and Poland, and became a classic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the next 25 years, N'gakane was able to do what he loves best, making documentaries and films, and, best of all, uniting filmmakers in Africa by founding Fepaci and organising film festivals in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was also co-scriptwriter and technical adviser on director Euzhan Palcy's version of Andre Brink's A Dry White Season in Zimbabwe -- and therein lies a lesson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None of the international films made in Zimbabwe helped local industry. &quot;The taxes paid for shooting there went into the exchequer,&quot; he says, &quot;so when film makers wanted financing, the government said there wasn't any.&quot; Local technicians who worked as crew on the films benefitted, but this experience doesn't go far if there's no industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Film should become self-sustaining, says N'gakane, who proposes a national film corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One can work out a model. A national film school would train aspiring filmmakers, first on television, then on film. Strong, regional distribution networks would guarantee local films screen time. But films need places to be shown, so the government would have to encourage the building of cinemas, either through direct financing or incentives for entreprenurs. In Harare, for example, all the cinemas, like those in Johannesburg, are in the centre of town; there is nothing in the townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of all, films need money. So an autonomous national film corporation could use financing partly from goverment subsidies, partly from taxes on film seats, partly from taxes paid by overseas filmmakers shooting here, partly by recycling some of the enormous profits made on American blockbusters. Distributors in most countries don't feel responsible for the local industry and are more interested in the business side, and American films make money. As a financing organisation, the national film corporation would be the first to be paid back from film profits, so it could finance more films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dream or possibility? The latter, I think. N'gakane's would begin by making Southern African film industries members of Fepaci, through the establishment of national regional associations. He's already founded a group to look at the dearth of cinemas in black townships, the Southern African Film Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ask him what his favourite film is, and the answer's an unexpected, &quot;Good God!&quot; Then, on reflection, &quot;there are so many. They keep on changing.&quot; He has a very soft spot, though, for The Red Ballon, a short film about a little boy that inspired N'gakane's own Jemima and Johnny. And there was How Green Was My Valley that caught his fancy -- he's seen it four of five times.  Comedy, drama, Western, they're &quot;all marvellous&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His only problem is his social life. &quot;There doesn't seem to be any in Johannesburg. In London I can go a few blocks to the local pub and Sam will be there, and Ted will be there, and Joe will be there. Here everybody goes to bed at eight o'clock. Come 11 o'clock and I feel I'm the only one awake in Johannesburg.&quot; If he is, he's probably working hard on ways to get the movie industry going.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, August 25 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THERE are not many people who could reduce their workforce by 300 people and say it had &quot;worked out marvellously&quot;. Certainly not former trade unionists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But then there are not many people who would turn down a cabinet post, opting instead to rebuild a political party with severe morale problems, huge debt, overstaffing and looming local government elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cyril Ramaphosa did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC secretary general is now confident that he is building a lean and mean party structure that will give the ANC the edge in next year's local government elections. &quot;Reorganisation (of the ANC) is a very difficult task, a daunting one which at some stage I thought would be very traumatic -- not only for the people working here but for myself as a trade unionist. &quot;In the end, it has worked out marvellously,&quot; he said in an interview this week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had anticipated having to give marching orders to up to 300 loyal cadres who had worked under difficult conditions for poor pay, largely out of dedication to the organisation, and who had missed out on the rush for cushy government jobs. It was widely reported that there was dissatisfaction among the cadres, and a good deal of bitterness at being left off the government gravy train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the end, Ramaphosa has had to retrench fewer than 100 people, of whom only about 15 did not volunteer for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was fortunate: the vast bulk of the 300 went into the country's 10 legislatures or the civil service, notably the security and intelligence forces. Another 80 found jobs elsewhere and took voluntary retrenchment. This left just a handful of people who, Ramaphosa adds, are &quot;fairly young and still hungry for training&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramaphosa has done major surgery on the ANC. About 450 jobs have been reduced to 120. The offices that sprawled across 20 floors of headquarters in Shell House, will now fit into just three, allowing the rest to be rented out. Twelve departments become a streamlined six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He did it by implosion. Every single job was advertised and every single employee who applied was interviewed afresh. Some were headhunted. So Joe Shabangu, for example, was brought back from parliament to head the organising department. And a finance department head is still being sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'When the president (Mandela) said the other day that the organisation is in tatters he was focusing on the brain drain we have suffered. We used to have fairly senior figures heading certain departments and divisions and we no longer have these people. We believe we now have a core of people who, out of sheer commitment, want to remain in the organisation and make sure it is strong,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The whole process has been a renewal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he's just beginning. Cleaning up headquarters is due for completion by the end of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September. Then he starts on the regions: cutting back from the ANC's current 14 regions into nine, to match the new provinces. These will be trimmed so that they can be entirely funded by levies on the salaries of parliamentarians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This part of the reorganisation is to be completed by the end of October, when each region will have held a congress to elect new regional leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then Ramaphosa will put in place a new sub- region and branch structure, by the end of December. For example, kwaZulu/Natal, currently three ANC regions, will become one province with up to 12 sub- regions, further divided into branches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spot the hidden agenda? For one thing, the troublesome Harry Gwala will either have to win election for the whole province of kwaZulu/Natal, an unlikely event, or he will be reduced to just one of 12 sub- regional leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of the process is to tie each MP to a sub- region. They will then be answerable to that structure, creating a rough parliamentary constituency system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reorganisation of this kind does not come without a cost -- especially when you are able to boast about retrenchment deals. &quot;The package has been excellent: four months ex gratia payment and two weeks for every year of service, as well as a bonus that people will have received. Quite a number of people went away with half-a-year's salary. This was good, but it has not been financially painless for us. It has increased our indebtedness, but we thought that was a price we had to pay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramaphosa won't answer questions about the size of the ANC's post-election debt, rumoured to be as much as R35-million. He will only say that he is confident that the ANC will be able -- through levies on MPs' salaries and other contributions -- to cover future running costs of its slimmed-down structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process will be completed well in time to fight the local government elections which, coming about a year into the new order, will provide the first major test of the ANC government's credibility. It is likely to provide a key indicator of the public perception of whether the ANC is delivering on its reconstruction and development promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The previous campaign leaders are unavailable: Popo Molefe and Terror Lekota are premiers and Khetso Gordhan is in the civil service. This time the man in charge is Shabangu, one of the guerrillas who blew up Sasol in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He's very disciplined, has an organised way of doing things. He's a military man -- and that's about what we need,&quot; Ramaphosa said. He will probably have, once again, the backing of advertising agency Hunt Lascaris and American master pollster Stanley Greenberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the moment, Ramaphosa says, 5 000 cadres are being trained for local government election organising, and another 10 000 will be trained during the build-up. Efforts will focus on the two provinces where the ANC was beaten, the Western Cape and kwaZulu/Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There will have to be another complicated selection process for candidates -- but the ANC's lesson in the national election was that this process is a critical part of the early campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party organisation is in Rama-phosa's hands, but implementation of the Reconstruction and Development Programme is not -- and that is probably what will decide the elections. &quot;People are going to be tempted to judge the ANC by what it has achieved at a national level, and that is why we obviously are going to want to ensure there is implementation of the RDP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are two departments especially geared to do this: the ANC's own RDP department, and another dedicated to co- ordination among the 10 legislatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And if you think that all of this does not give Ramaphosa enough work, he presides over the constituent assembly that has two years in which to draft a new constitution and which keeps him flitting between Johannesburg and Cape Town. Every one of his suppers last week was eaten in an airplane.  &quot;It takes its toll,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But ask him about his opponents and he's off, quick as a flash, to score political points against the National Party. Is he concerned about NP leader FW de Klerk's warning that &quot;red lights are flashing&quot; in the government of national unity? &quot;I think the GNU is working quite well. De Klerk has not acclimatised himself to being number three in the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is there truth in the allegation that the ANC caucus is unruly? &quot;De Klerk is used to a caucus that operates on the basis of some form of autocracy. Or caucus is based on democratic principles where we are able to persuade one another and the majority view prevails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Obviously there are contradictions and there are bound to be tensions that need to be properly managed. But I think a healthy relationship is developing (between the caucus and ANC leadership).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramaphosa points a finger at De Klerk's own caucus. &quot;When we started off there wasn't total rejection of the notion of giving the NP certain positions, such as the presidency of the Senate and the deputy chairperson of the constitutional assembly. That was done in the spirit of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But that is being chipped away now, it is being eroded by the statements of some Nat MPs. There is a growing feeling in the ANC caucus that, if the NP wants to play this role of an opposition, then we don't need to be that accommodating.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, August 25 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A REQUEST from ousted Lesotho Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle to Southern African leaders for a peace- keeping force to quell an army uprising lay behind King Letsie III's dramatic suspension of his government, the Mail &amp; Guardian learned this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evaristus Sekhonyana, appointed by Letsie as foreign minister in the interim government he formed after dissolving that of Mokhehle, said he believed Mokhehle's action would either plunge the country into civil war or precipitate a military coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking from Gaborone, Botswana this week, Sekhonyana claimed Letsie's action against Mokhehle's government -- which swept to power in the kingdom's first democratic elections last year -- was sparked by the discovery last month of a letter in which Mokhehle requested a peace-keeping force from Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe to quell an internal military dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sekhonyana said Mokhehle, when confronted with the letter, conceded he had ommitted to inform the king and parliament of the request.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He lied to parliament and the nation. The king has the right to be informed on all matters of state. What Dr Mokhehle did was treason and a crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A small group of Lesotho citizens living and working in South Africa demonstrated outside Pretoria's Union Buildings in support of Mokhehle while President Nelson Mandela, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe and Botswana's President Ketumile Masire began discussions with King Letsie and the man he deposed in last Wednesday's &quot;royal coup&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Southern African leaders were expected to threaten economic sanctions against the land-locked kingdom unless the king restored democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of his country's legal profession announced a stayaway yesterday, demanding that Letsie's new government step down and calling for a return to the rule of law and the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Law Society of Lesotho also demanded the resignation of Lesotho Chief Justice Joseph Kheola, accusing him of violating a basic principle of justice by swearing in members of the monarch's provisional government without first consulting his fellow judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A two-day general strike in protest against Letsie's action ended on Tuesday pending the outcome of yesterday's talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The law society has called on all its members to boycott any court appearances from last Wednesday to this coming Wednesday. Its members had already joined the two-day general stayaway at the beginning of this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement claimed Kheola's actions had undermined the independence and integrity of the Lesotho judiciary at a time when he should have demonstrated that the impartiality of the judiciary was unquestionable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Candi Raimoane, editor and publisher of Lesotho's weekly, Mo Afrika, the intervention of Archbishop Desmond Tutu had not been well received by many of those opposed to the interim government formed by King Letsie III.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu was invited to arbitrate in the crisis by the Lesotho Christian Council. At the end of his mission, Tutu called for a Codesa- type of dialogue to resolve the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But the critics point out that the council itself had not come out clearly and opposed the new government. Tutu's appearance was seen as some sort of foreign intervention instead of the council sitting down and resolving the domestic question,&quot; said Raimoane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was denied by Ramolulela Taula, general secretary of the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;The LCC does not have a specific stand on the issue. It accepts that there may have been bad things on both sides. It therefore facilitated the two sides to come together and review the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Before we make statements we must be sure of the facts. We are doing so much without calling it to the attention of the people and the media.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, August 25 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EIGHTY-FOUR-year-old Andries Radebe is one of almost 3 000 people who were removed from Crimen in the 1970s and resettled in Ezakheni, near Ladysmith. Radebe and 98 other landowners had the added pain of seeing their land lie unused for 11 years, before being sold to a private owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After efforts to get back their land, including an attempted reoccupation, they sought redress in the supreme court. When their case was dismissed in February, it seemed the only route left was the Appellate Division -- and a wait of two years for the appeal to be heard. Not an attractive option for an 84-year-old.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Radebe may not have to wait that long. The Restitution of Land Rights Bill, to be tabled in parliament in the next two weeks, will entitle about 1,4-million of the estimated 3,5-million people who were forcibly removed to make claims for restitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Underpinning the draft legislation is the need to make restitution quick, effective and accessible and to encourage local settlement of disputes. Two mechanisms will ensure this: the Land Claims Commission, with offices in every province, and the Land Claims Court, which will operate as a circuit court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All claims for restitution must be lodged within three years of the start of the restitution process. They must first go to the Land Claims Commission, which will investigate claims, propose solutions and try to negotiate and mediate settlements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Claims the commission cannot resolve will go to the court, which will also ratify agreements reached by the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court will be able to order the transfer of state land and the expropriation or purchase of land privately owned. If privately- owned land is expropriated, the state will have to compensate current owners, taking into account the history of the property's acquisition, its market value and the interests of the parties involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court could award claimants alternative land, just compensation or alternative remedies, if it does not restore land to claimants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Awards will take into account compensation claimants received at the time of their dispossession and this will be deducted from the award. Awards will also take into account whether parties refused to negotiate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court will be a specialised court of law, which will be able to receive any evidence which it considers relevant. Appeals against Land Claims Court decisions will go to the Constitutional Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where rural communities do get back their land, the government will help them re- settle. The Department of Land Affairs says that for each of the 100 rural communities it has identified as potential beneficiaries of restitution, restitution would cost between R1-million and R2-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minister of Land Affairs Derek Hanekom says his department has asked for 20 percent of reconstruction and development programme funds to meet the cost of redistribution and restitution projects, including five pilot projects for each province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while the Bill will do much to redress forced removals, it will not deal with problems generated by land hunger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Department of Land Affairs estimates that about 700 000 urban people and about 100 rural claims, involving about 700 000 people, could be eligible for restitution. Rural claims &quot;may include some categories of labour tenants who were removed in the 1970s&quot;, Hanekom said, &quot;but not people who were affected by mechanisation in agriculture or the ending of contractual relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My department will facilitate discussion between landowners and tenants and try to reach some sort of arrangement to benefit people who occupied land for some time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is mindful of the limitations of the draft restitution law. To address the much more complex issue of general land hunger, his ministry is preparing a White Paper on land reform, which will go beyond restitution and should be ready by the end of 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, August 19 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ARMSCOR is willing to pay up to R54-million in an out- of-court settlement to save its officials the embarrassment of being extradited to the United States for a trial involving charges of violating the iternational arms embargo against Pretoria in the 1980s, say government sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Fuchs Electronics (Pty) Ltd, a former Barlow Rand subsidiary also implicated in the case, would have to pay a similar amount as part of the proposed out-of-court settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sources believe the trial is part of a concerted effort by US authorities to keep Armscor out of the lucrative international arms market.  In June the US government issued a &quot;denial order&quot; against the South African parastatal and its subsidiaries, as well as against Fuchs. This effectively prohibits American firms from trading with these companies, and acts as an effective arms ban against South Africa -- even though the official arms embargo imposed by the United Nations in 1977 has been lifted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Official documents in the possession of the WM&amp;G indicate that the US government is demanding the extradition of high-ranking Armscor and Fuchs officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They include Bert Quinn, former manager of the missile guidance group at Kentron, a former Armscor subsidiary which designed and manufactured guided weapons and missile systems for the corporation; Brian Scott, also known as Graham Craighness, then materials manager for Kentron; and former Kentron &quot;frontmen&quot; Johan Lombard, Gerrit Pretorius and Vern Davis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Armscor agent, William Metelerkamp, and former technical director of Fuchs, Jaco Budericks, are also listed on the US charge sheet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The men and the companies they represented were involved in multimillion dollar deals designed to provide countries with advanced war technology, in contravention of the 1980s international arms embargo. One of their deals allegedly included an arms- for-oil transaction that provided Iraq's Saddam Hussein's army with missile technology used against Allied forces during the Gulf war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week, South African arms manufacturer Denel, of which Kentron is now a division, referred all questions about the case to Armscor. Last week, Armscor refused to comment on the case or the list of names, but admitted that the corporation was involved in &quot;sensitive&quot; negotiations with the US government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South Africans, Armscor, Kentron, Fuchs and seven Americans face charges of conspiracy to evade the UN arms embargo against South Africa, fraud, money laundering, forgery and tax evasion, among others, in a Pennsylvanian court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the charges relate to illegal deals between an American firm, International Signal and Control (ISC), and Armscor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charge sheet says ISC smuggled missile components and guidance systems, parts of night-vision devices, air-navigation devices, missile-tracking systems and munition technology, worth tens of millions of llars, from the US to South Africa, in defiance of US arms control laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The indictment also lists:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Attempts by Armscor and ISC to sell US$300- million worth of South African missiles to the People's Republic of China in 1984. It is not known if the deal went through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * A deal, brokered by ISC, through which South Africa provided Iraq with bomb technology in exchange for crude oil, between 1985 and 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * That Armscor and ISC set up a complex international network of front companies -- stretching from Singapore to Belgium -- to facilitate and conceal the transfer of arms and technology from the US to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * That South African front companies took part in a conspiracy by ISC to inflate -- to the tune of $1- billion -- &quot;the sales, costs and profits of ISC in order to secure financing and investors&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Listen closely to rumour mongers at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and you will hear joyous cries of &quot;The multi-nationals are coming back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If statistics provided by the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre are anything to go by, foreign investment is definitely bound for our shores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Distributed in South Africa by McGregors, the research shows that since the official lifting of federal sanctions in July 1991, 60 US companies have returned. This brings the number of US firms invested here to 164.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the Centre indicates that 15 new US and eight other foreign companies have re-entered South Africa since July this year. These include Novell, Apple Computer, Lotus and Quickpath Systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPC International, Honeywell, IBM and Sara Lee have announced the reacquisition of some or all of the equity in former South African subsidiaries. Other companies which were previously invested in South Africa and are to return include Cummins Engine Co, Dow Jones, Measurex Corp and Procter &amp; Gamble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question being asked by analysts is whether these companies will set up factories and retail outlets or just open up offices to sell products manufactured in their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, Apple Computer has a joint venture with HNR Computers, whereby that company will use its national infrastructure to market and sell Apple products. Only when the company has paid for the product in advance, does Apple ship the equipment to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McGregors' figures confirm that total direct assets do not amount to much, but it stresses that a vast number of companies do have a presence in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says McGregors: &quot;Although the total direct assets of US companies are only R844-million, a further 469 US companies maintain a visible presence in South Africa through franchises, agencies, distribution agreements and loans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of analysts are more optimistic. One indicates that Procter &amp; Gamble has &quot;never simply opened up an office in another country. It brings its own staff, marketing agents and other experts and usually rips through its competitors.&quot; He adds that, in this case, Unilever would finally have a worthwhile competitor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, August 12 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN American court has accused a former Barlow Rand company of illegally supplying Iraq with bomb technology in exchange for thousands of tons of crude oil in the 1980s. The bombs were used by Saddam Hussein's army during the Gulf War, while the fuel was used to bust the United Nation's oil embargo against the apartheid state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United States prosecutors say Fuchs Electronics (Pty) Ltd, a South African electronics company controlled by Barlow in the 1980s, conspired with an American armaments corporation to supply Iraq with electronic fuses used to ignite artillery rounds and cluster bombs. According to a charge sheet lodged with a Pennsylvanian court, an American firm, International Signal and Control (ICS), set up a scheme whereby it would export fuses via South Africa to Iraq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As part of the ... deal ISC would supply up to 300 000 FF-1 fuses to defendant Fuchs for delivery to IMEC (a firm with Iraqi links) and, in turn, would receive in excess of US$33-million, which would be paid to ISC by defendant Fuchs after it received payment from its customer, Iraq, in crude oil,&quot; says the indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Between in or about 1985 and 1989, the defendants (ISC) would, and did, export in excess of US$4,4-million worth of fuse power supplies to Darlon in the RSA on behalf of defendant Fuchs to maintain defendant Fuchs' production line of fuses and to assist Fuchs fulfil its fuse production requirements with Iraq.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has long been known that Barlow affiliates and Armscor collaborated with the US-based ISC to supply Hussein's government with hi-tech war materiel in defiance of American arms export regulations. However, this is the first evidence that the trade involved a bombs-for-oil swop designed to circumvent the international oil embargo against Pretoria in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American prosecutors are determined to convict ISC, Armscor, Fuchs and a number of these companies' directors for violating the arms embargo against Iraq and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to sources involved in other illicit deals with Armscor in the 1980s, the South African parastatal is trying to set up an out- of-court deal with the American prosecutors. The company is reported to be willing to pay large fines so that its officials do not have to make humiliating court appearances in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sources say the Americans are refusing to accept the proposed settlement because they want to force Armscor out of the lucrative international arms market, thereby getting rid of a competitor and a potential source of arms proliferation in the Third World.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armscor refused to comment on the allegations. It did, however, confirm that the company was involved in an arms case in the US and was involved in &quot;sensitive negotiations with the US government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Barlow spokesman insisted there was no present relationship between Fuchs and the corporation, and said they had no knowledge of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court hearing, to be held in a US district court in Pennsylvania, is the culmination of years of investigation by American federal investigators into a multibillion dollar set of deals and arms syndicates that revolved around ISC and its director, James Guerin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Detectives and law-enforcement officers have been probing evidence that Armscor and Barlow affiliates received illegal shipments of electronic equipment used for ballistic missiles, artillery shells and cluster bombs from ISC and then passed these on to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The American firm is accused of using its South African connections as a conduit for sending illicit consignments of ballistic missile equipment, as well as cluster bomb technology developed in Chile, to Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Do you remember watching the anti-aircraft bursts from Baghdad on CNN -- the first of the Allied bombing in that country. Well, that was some of the stuff which got into Iraq through ISC shipments to South Africa,&quot; a federal investigator is quoted as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shipments from ISC indirectly helped Iraq build a cluster-bomb factory. Most of this equipment was manufactured by a Chilean firm, Cardoen.  ISC brokered deals which ensured that parts were sent from Chile to South Africa and were then shipped on to Iraq.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, July 29, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SABC proposal to downgrade Afrikaans is unlikely to fly, reports Drew Forrest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ENGLISH language chauvinists beware -- if the number of English-speakers in South Africa is the yardstick, it is the language of Shakespeare, not Hendrik Verwoerd, that should be downgraded in our public life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Official figures indicate that only eight percent of South Africans speak English as a first language, and 30 percent as a subsidiary language.  For Afrikaans, the figures are 16 percent and 35 percent or more respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What protects English-speakers -- notoriously the least multilingual of South Africans -- is the world dominance of the United States in commerce and popular culture.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is commercial, not political considerations which lie behind the controversial proposal by SABC television management to downgrade Afrikaans on TV, reshaping TV1 as an all-English affair and relegating Afrikaans to one of 10 language media on CCV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spearheaded by arch-commercialiser Quentin Green, head of SABC-TV, the proposal is premised on the fact that foreign English-language programmes are on average four times cheaper than those made at home. Afrikaans programmes also have lower ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposal is unlikely to fly, for the simple reason that the new SABC bosses recognise that public broadcasting is about more than turning a profit. But the controversy has turned a spotlight on the place of Afrikaans in a black-ruled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Constitutionally, the position is clear: the interim constitution entrenches the current standing of both Afrikaans and English, calling only for South Africa's indigenous languages to be developed to the same level.  There were suggestions this week that any move to downgrade Afrikaans on TV would violate language rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, Afrikaans acquired overweening status under successive National Party governments. The Education Ministry, for example, subsidised an Afrikaans dictionary unit to the tune of R1,2-million last year, while ignoring African languages.  It retains its symbolism as the language of the security policeman, the hanging judge and the administration board official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RAU academic Susan Booysen dismisses the outcry over the broadcasting proposal as &quot;new South African pseudo-resistance politics, which invokes the constitution and national reconciliation to protect minority privilege&quot;. Rev Henno</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cronje, chief executive of the Afrikaans cultural watchdog the FAK, disagrees: &quot;It must be accepted that it is a major language -- 16-million can use it, while one or two of the black languages have fewer than a million speakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The problem is that English is so strong. To make TV1 an English-only channel would further strengthen it against all other local tongues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For University of the Western Cape academic Hein Willemse, a member of the ANC's language commission, the role of Afrikaans in broadcasting is part of a much larger conundrum: that of ensuring democratic access in a multilingual society. Namibia had failed by entrenching English as the sole broadcasting medium in a country where only four percent of Namibians spoke it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Breadth of access had, however, to be squared with commercial viability. &quot;We will have to negotiate a balance between the commercial interests and language responsibilities of the public broadcaster,&quot; Willemse said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In education, the dilemma lies in granting the universally acknowledged human right of mother-tongue education in a country with 11 official languages and others, like Gujerati and Hindi, in wide use. Arguing that Afrikaans universities will continue to have a place -- although &quot;the future will decide their numbers&quot; -- Cronje sees Soweto '76 as an object lesson in the dangers of imposing any language as a teaching medium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Afrikaans universities have diverged under the new pressures. RAU, for example, has broken ranks by phasing in English lectures from next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A White Paper due out shortly will clarify government policy on language in education. Likely to differ from region to region, it will have to tread a delicate line between cultural needs and the practical requirements of society. &quot;Realistically, this is going to mean the introduction of English at a certain level with the option of the mother tongue as a second language,&quot; Willemse remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In many areas, for example, the public service, affirmative action and the destruction of Afrikaner political hegemony will naturally erode the dominance of Afrikaans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources say the workload of the language services unit in the Department of Arts and Culture, which translates government documents, has doubled under the new official language policy. They add that a departmental task group, due to report back at the end of August, will &quot;inevitably&quot; recommend a shift towards the fostering of black languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ultimate aim, most Afrikaner intellectuals argue, must be to strip Afrikaans of its apartheid prominence while recognising its stature as a language, the profound sensitivities which surround it and the fact that it is not the exclusive property of right-wing whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We must be careful here. Language is a powerful medium for reconciliation,&quot; said &quot;coloured&quot; poet Adam Small, who confessed himself &quot;hurt&quot; by suggestions that Afrikaans, his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mother tongue, should be downgraded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Added left-wing novelist Andre Brink: &quot;Afrikaans was the language of apartheid in some perceptions, but it also played a role in the downfall of apartheid. It was used by Afrikaner dissidents to attack the establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is time it lost is privileged status. But there is ample scope for it to remian an important language of our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Winnie Mandela is without a doubt one of South Africa's world-renowned political leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a controversial figure, her role and personality mean different things to different people. One thing is clear though her marriage to the state President Nelson Mandela and her implacable hatred of white domination, place her among a special class of our distinguished contemporaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, who is Winnie? Is she a heroine, a pacifist, a demagogue or an enigma? Author Emma Gilbey attempt to provide answers to these questions in her book titled &quot;The Lady - Life and Times of Winnie Mandela&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book traces her rural background of Bizana in the Transkei. She is the fourth child of Columbus and Gertrude Madikizela. Her parents had three daughters already. They, together with her strong and domineering grandmother, had hoped for a boy. This attitude contributed to the shaping of her thinking and behaviour throughtout her life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After graduating from the local primary school, her father sent her to Jan Hofmeyr School of Social Work in Johannesburg in the early '50s. The National Party (NP) had been elevated to power in 1948 and it vigourously implemented racist policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The oppressed blacks had rallied behind the ANC which spearheaded the struggle for liberation and equality. The ANC Youth League formed in the late '40s and led by Anton Lembede, Oliver Tambo and Nelson Mandela among other young firebrands, mapped out aggressive and co-ordinated opposition to teh apartheid regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After completing her studies, Winnie took up post as a social worker at the Baragwanath Hospital. She became the first black to obtain the qualification. It was while working there that she friendship with Adelaide Tshukudu who was to become the wife of Oliver Tambo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One day while Winnie was travelling with Tambo and Adelaide to Baragwanath, on the way they met with Nelson Mandela. This led to Tambo introducing Winnie to Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After Mandela's divorce with Evelyn, a whirlwind romance ensued. In May 1958, Winnie and Mandela got married. Henceforth Winnie, on Mandela's encouragement became more entangled in political activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the same year, nearly 2,000 women gathered in the centre of Johannesberg to protest against the pass law. Winnie was one of them. For her role in the demonstration, she spent a fortnight in prison. She was detained several times thereafter. On her release from detention, she was fired at Baragwanath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book shows clearly a lack of blissful moments in their married life. Mandela was among the 156 accused at teh Johannesburg Magistrate's Court. The trial which dragged on for months, became known as the Treason Trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1958 the couple was blessed with a daughter, Zenani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nineteen-sixty (1960) was a watershed in South African history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the same year, both the ANC and PAC were outlawed and the State of Emergency was enforced, resulting in massive arrests and bannings. Mandela went underground and Tambo fled into exile to form the ANC military wing Umkhonto weSizwe (MK). Mandela also skipped the country to campaign for MK.  For 18 months he evaded a massive police hunt, earning him the nickname &quot;The Black Pimpernell&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mandelas' second daughter, Zinzi, was born in 1960.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While police were looking for Mandela, Winnie and her two daughters had to content with the dreadful dawn raids. Mandela was later arrested in a roadblock near Escourt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was charged with nine ANC leaders in 1964 during the Rivonia Trial and sentenced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This never seriously daunted Winnie. She instead continued with the struggle. With the outbreak of the 1976 uprising, Winnie became a member of the Black Parents Association. The following year she wsa banished to a small town of Brandfort in the Orange Free State (OFS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book also reveals several emotional brief visits to her husband.  On such such trips she used to be subjected to indignities by the prison officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gilbey traces the psychological effects this had on Winnie. She argues that the growing power which Winnie felt within her made her feel she was above the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The author cites her formation of the Mandela Football club which conducted a reign of terror in the community. This culminated in teh death of a young activist Stompie Sepei. Many other murder cases in which Winnie was implicated were followed. In 1991 Winnie appeared in the Rand Supreme Court on four counts of abduction and four counts of violence with intent to do grievous bodily harm. She was fined R6 000 and set free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book also touches on her fall from grace as a result of her activities with the Mandela FC. It tells of her rejection by the Mass Democratic Movement (MDM) and the community of Soweto at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book ends on a sad note with the separation of Winnie and Mandela, depriving her of a deserving wedded bliss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Lady&quot; is a well researched and compelling book. But it suffers from many digressions. At some stage one forgets that Winnie is its subject.  It also reveals the author's bias against Winnie and the ANC in particular.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One year after presidential elections in Togo and six months on from the country's first ever multi-party elections, past human rights violations remain uninvestigated and unaccounted for and violations continue to be carried out by the Togolese security forces, according to Amnesty International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Since the new government came to power, insecurity in the capital, Lome, has continued despite the announcement of measures aimed at establishing the rule of law,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recent information suggests that political activists and some returning refugees have been harassed and intimidated by members of the Togolese Armed Forces or by armed groups and individuals, some of whom may be working in collusion with the Togolese Armed Forces. A number of businessmen -- particularly financiers -- have been the target of recent assassination attempts, some of which have been successful.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The security forces have also allegedly arbitrarily detained people on account of their political opinions. One man who was arbitrarily arrested by soldiers in July was allegedly held in a secret detention centre with 12 other detainees; he was held for 19 days and subjected to torture and ill-treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government is not known to have made any attempt to establish responsibility for any of these incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Unless the Togolese government puts the protection of human rights firmly on the political agenda, and punishes those found guilty of past and present abuses, the future safeguard of human rights in the country cannot be assured,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a report published today, the human rights organization is calling on the new government of Togo to confirm its commitment to investigate past violations and bring cases to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although the new government itself is not responsible for human rights abuses committed in the past, it now needs to acknowledge and investigate these violations -- notably those committed by the security forces -- as a clear indication that such abuses will not be tolerated in the future,&quot; Amnesty International said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scores of people were extrajudicially executed, arbitrarily arrested, tortured and harassed by the security forces during the period of political transition in Togo. This began with the National Conference in 1991 and ended with presidential and multi- party legislative elections in August 1993 and February this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International's new report documents violations during the election period. These include the death in custody of at least 20 opposition supporters in August last year; the extrajudicial execution of at least 48 people by members of the Togolese Armed Forces following an alleged attack in Lome this January; the killing of a member of parliament, Gaston Aziaduvo Edeh, and two other political activists and the &quot;disappearance&quot; of at least four people in February this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new report also calls on the government to implement urgently needed human rights reforms, including vigorous measures to eradicate torture and a review of the cases of political prisoners still held. These include prisoner of conscience Martin Dossou Gbenouga, a newspaper editor, sentenced to five years' imprisonment in May in connection with an article which criticized President Eyadema and the French Government. His conviction fits into a long-standing pattern of intimidation and harassment of independent journalists, newspaper publishers and vendors in Togo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International is also concerned about the continued detention without charge or trial of trade union leader Komi Dackey, arrested on 11 January this year. The government claims that Komi Dackey is among a number of individuals held on suspicion of their involvement in a violent attack on the headquarters of the Regiment interarmes togolais (RIT), Togolese Combined Regiment in Lome on 5 January, but other sources maintain that he was arrested because of his trade union activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International believes that the Togolese authorities should urgently review these and other cases, with a viw to completing the judicial process fairly and speedily and releasing prisoners who are detained on account of their non-violent political views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organization is also urging other governments which have links with Togo to assist the Togolese authorities in improving human rights.  Any government that has renewed its military assistance to Togo, in particular the French government - - who were the first to do so -- should ensure that any such assistance incorporates training in respect for human rights and is not used to facilitate human rights violations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) deplored the closure of the Sudanese office of &quot;Al-Khartoum&quot; newspaper. The office was raided by security forces on September 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Al-Khartoum&quot; is published in Cairo by exiled Sudanese journalists. It is distributed in Egypt, the Gulf and Europe, but is forbidden in Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a letter to Lt. General Omar Hassan Bashir, who came to power in a fundamentalist-backed coup in 1989, CPJ demanded the release of &quot;Al-Khartoum&quot; reporter Mohamed Abd al-Seed. He was arrested on June 23 and has not been heard from since. CPJ fears that he is being held in a clandestine detention center.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your Excellency:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) is deeply disturbed by the closure of the Khartoum office of &quot;Al-Khartoum&quot; newspaper. And we are extremely alarmed by the prolonged detention of one of &quot;Al-Khartoum's&quot; reporters, Mohamed Abd al-Seed. On September 11, members of the security forces raided and closed the Khartoum office of the independent Cairo-based newspaper &quot;Al-Khartoum.&quot; One day earlier the office received a warning from the international section of the Ministry of Culture and Information, that the bureau would be closed, sources at the newspaper told CPJ. Officials confiscated the press cards of all five journalists who worked in the bureau: Mohamed Mahmoud Rajih, Mu'tasim Mahmoud (who had been imprisoned earlier this year), Nafisa al-Haj, Murtada al-Ghali, and Najib Nourredine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudanese authorities have given no official explanation for the closure. Security officials claim that &quot;Al-Khartoum's&quot; office was being used to arrange clandestine opposition meetings. This has been emphatically denied by the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ is very concerned about the well-being of &quot;Al-Khartoum&quot; reporter Mohamed Abd al-Seed, a matter we have already taken up with Your Excellency in a June 24 letter. On June 23 security forces entered the offices of Al-Khartoum. After beating and kicking Mr. Abd al-Seed, the officers accused him of involvement in a plot to assassinate Hassan al-Turabi, leader of the National Islamic Front (NIF), and took him into custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over three months later, Mr. Abd al-Seed's whereabouts remain unknown to his family and colleagues, his employers report. Last year, when he was Khartoum bureau chief for the Saudi-owned daily newspaper Asharq al-Awsat, he was arrested and held for nearly two months in a &quot;ghost house.&quot; CPJ fears that he has once again been thrown into one of these clandestine detention centers where prisoners are routinely tortured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a nonpartisan organization of journalists dedicated to the defense of our colleagues' rights throughout the world, CPJ believes the closure of &quot;Al-Khartoum's&quot; office will have a chilling effect on news coverage of Sudan.  We respectfully urge the government of Sudan to allow the office to reopen, return its employees' press cards and assure that they can resume their journalistic work unhindered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, CPJ denounces the incommunicado detention of Mohamed Abd al-Seed as a flagrant violation of Article 19 of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We urge the government of Sudan to release him immediately and unconditionally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By its resolution 935 (1994) of 1 July 1994, the Security Council requested me to establish, as a matter of urgency, an impartial Commission of Experts to examine and analyse information submitted pursuant to that resolution, together with such further information as the Commission of Experts might obtain through its own investigations or the efforts of other persons or bodies, including the information made available by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on Rwanda, with a view to providing me with its conclusions on the evidence of grave violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of Rwanda, including the evidence of possible acts of genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 26 and 29 July 1994, I informed the Security Council of the establishment of the Commission and its terms of reference and composition (S/1994/879 and S/1994/906).  On that occasion, I expressed the hope that, in view of the urgency of the matter, the final report of the Commission would be submitted not later than 30 November 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Commission began its work on 15 August 1994 and, after a series of meetings in Geneva, conducted a field mission to Rwanda and some neighbouring countries from 29 August to 17 September 1994.  Pursuant to a decision taken at its first session, the Commission has transmitted to me an interim report which covers its preliminary investigations and activities prior to 30 September 1994.  The Commission has taken the period 6 April 1994 to 15 July 1994 as the temporal mandate for the purpose of its interim report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The interim report provides an account of the evidence gathered by the Commission during its field visit to Rwanda or provided by various Governments, intergovernmental institutions and non-governmental organizations.  It also contains conclusions and recommendations and describes a plan of work for the remainder of its activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wish to draw your attention to the conclusions reached at this stage by the Commission, namely that, in the period under consideration:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (a) Individuals from both sides to the armed conflict have perpetrated serious breaches of international humanitarian law, in particular of obligations set forth in article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and in Protocol II additional to the Geneva Conventions and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts of 8 June 1977;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (b) Individuals from both sides to the armed conflict have perpetrated crimes against humanity in Rwanda;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (c) Acts of genocide against the Tutsi group were perpetrated by Hutu elements in a concerted, planned, systematic and methodical way.  These acts of mass extermination against the Tutsi group as such constitute genocide within the meaning of article II of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.  The Commission has not uncovered any evidence to indicate that Tutsi elements perpetrated acts committed with the intent to destroy the Hutu ethnic group as such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Commission of Experts has recommended that the Security Council take all necessary and effective action to ensure that the individuals responsible for the foregoing grave violations of human rights in Rwanda during the armed conflict are brought to justice before an independent and impartial international criminal tribunal.  In order to enhance the fair and consistent interpretation, application and adjudication of international law on individual responsibility for serious human rights violations and to achieve the most efficient allocation of resources, the Commission has further recommended that the Security Council amend the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia so that it can consider crimes under international law committed during the armed conflict in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of the importance of the contents of the interim report, in particular of its conclusions and recommendations, I am forwarding a copy to you for the information of the Council.  I will, of course, bring to the attention of the Security Council the final report envisaged in paragraph 3 of resolution 935 (1994) as soon as the Commission makes it available to me.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following statement was issued today by the Spokesman for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary-General is gravely concerned over the deterioration of humanitarian conditions in Liberia resulting from factional fighting, victimization of innocent civilians and the impossibility of conducting relief operations in most parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since early September, intense fighting has erupted in many parts of Liberia, particularly the central region around the town of Gbarnga.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well over 100,000 people have been displaced by this latest wave of hostilities, with 55,000 new arrivals registered by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Guinea and 40,000 in Cote d'Ivoire.  This latest wave of refugees joins the 700,000 already exiled since the start of the Liberian civil war in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While those crossing the border will receive emergency assistance from the UNHCR and the World Food Programme (WFP), thousands of displaced and injured civilians trapped inside the country cannot be reached by humanitarian agencies.  The intense fighting, willful disregard of the security of humanitarian workers and seizure of nearly all their vehicles, equipment and relief stocks have forced the suspension of humanitarian assistance outside Monrovia and its environs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary-General deplores the wanton destruction of life and property in Liberia and calls upon the warring factions to create conditions in which humanitarian assistance can be safely delivered to all Liberians in need.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Excerpts: WHITE PAPER -- DISCUSSION DOCUMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> September 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CONCLUSION: A NATIONAL CONSENSUS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This first White Paper on Reconstruction and Development has set out key change management strategies for transformation, particular of government at all levels. It also sets out guidelines on areas of particular importance for change. This is the first in a series. The second will be published for comment in March 1995 and will set out in more detail specific policies, together with an evaluation of process.  Daunting challenges face government in implementing the programme set out in this paper. Perhaps the most crucial is the establishment of credible and effective Local Government, in both urban and rural areas. Without this, implementation of development programmes will be seriously hindered. It will require a sustained and intensive campaign which brings together Central Government, Provincial Governments, existing local authorities, civics, trade unions, business and other community organizations. Local Government development will also require a huge effort in human recourse and capacity development. Existing institutions will be challenged to provide this input in a coordinated</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The stability of Local Government services depends on the regular payment of user charges. The first step in achieving this is to make all aspects of Local Government finances completely open and transparent. This must be done also with the finances and cost structures of both municipal and national utilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furt(her planning of a campaign to restore stability to local authority finances must be done together with mass organizations and especially with trade unions active in Local Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaign will only be successful if government at all levels is prepared to go out to the people, to talk, clarify and explain, and to answer questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of affordable tariffs, targeted subsidies and targeted welfare delivery must be resolved as a matter of urgency.  Communities must be prepared to commit themselves to performance contracts in terms of which they undertake to participate in the planning, management and protection of development programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a second major challenge in implementing the Government's programme. For the RDP to be 'people-driven', there must be a vibrant civil society. However, there is a tendency at present to believe that 'the Government will deliver on its own'. This has the potential to disempower the organizations of civil society. Communities and organizations are listing projects and expecting the Government to pass over a cheque. Rather, organizations and communities should themselves set up projects and expect the Government to cooperate, not to finance. The Government must proactively assist civil society to gain access to information and to participate effectively in the consultations required for a 'people-driven' RDP(P.  Equally, civil society must ensure that the resources of Local and Provincial Governments are rapidly re-organized and redirected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third major challenge is to ensure that the change management process in government moves sufficiently rapidly to allow significant changes in the deployment of staff and expenditure before the Budget in March 1995.  This must include changes in budgeting procedures, control and management of programmes and asset policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The responsibility for the renewal and transformation of our nation is, however, not the responsibility only of the Government nor of particular elected officials. It is a joint responsibility of all sections of our nation, and calls on all to put their energy and creativity into finding ways of doing things better and differently. The constraints and obstacles which can prevent delivery of a better life for all of our people can be solved if those constituencies most involved in a sector apply their minds to the problem jointly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This partnership and national consensus does not mean that different constituencies and organizations of civil society cannot or should not have their own aims and goals. It does, however, mean that they should attempt to make those aims and goals consistent with the aims of the RDP and of renewal of our society, in a conscious and honest process. It is essential that organizations of civil society do, in fact, have clear goals which reflect the real interests of their members, but they should lead their members in attempting to align those goals with the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this way the energy of the nation can be harnessed for the good of all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Botswana government discriminates against women by denying their right to pass Botswana citizenship to their children from marriages to foreign men; by contrast, under Botswana's Citizenship Act, children born to Botswana men and foreign women automatically become Botswana nationals. In &quot;Second Class Citizens: Discrimination Against Women Under Botswana's Citizenship Act,&quot; released on September 14, 1994, Human Rights Watch/Africa and Human Rights Watch Women's Rights Project accuse the government of undermining the rule of law and independence of the judiciary by continuing to enforce the law even though the country's highest court ruled, in 1992 landmark case &quot;Attorney General v. Unity Dow,&quot; that section 4 of the Citizenship Act is unconstitutional because it discriminates against women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This singularly discriminatory law also interferes with Botswana women's freedom of movement and marriage, and leads to discrimination against affected children in education and employment. Human Rights Watch urges the Botswana government to uphold the ruling of Botswana's Court of Appeal by immediately amending section and other discriminatory sections of the citizenship Act. Published by Human Rights Watch, &quot;Second Class Citizens: Discrimination Against Women under Botswana's Citizenship Act,&quot; documents the landmark case &quot;Attorney General v. Unity Dow&quot; and the Botswana government's subsequent defiance of the Appeal Court's decision. According to one of the Appeal Court Justices, &quot;the effect of section 4 of the (Citizenship) Act is to accord an advantage or a privilege to a man which is denied to a woman. A more discriminatory provision can hardly be found.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under this provision, a person born in Botswana acquires citizenship by birth and descent if &quot;his father is a citizen of Botswana or in the case of a person born out of wedlock, his mother was a citizen of Botswana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Botswana woman married to a foreign male has no chance of passing Botswana citizenship to her children, regardless of whether the children were born in Botswana, have taken up residence in Botswana, or have never been outside of Botswana. Such children are treated as aliens and require residence permits to remain in Botswana. The law does not, however, apply to any child born to a Botswana father, regardless of where the child was born or even if the child has never been in Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In June 1990, Unity Dow, married to American citizen Peter Nathan Dow, commenced legal action challenging the constitutionality of sections 4 and 5 of the citizenship Act on the grounds that they discriminate by reason of sex. (The Appeal Court ruled that Dow lacked legal standing to contest section 5 which concerns children born ousted of Botswana). The couple, married in 1984, have three children. Unity's first daughter, Cheese Maitumelo Dow, was born out of wedlock before the 1984 Citizenship (Amendment) Act and was later adopted by Peter Dow.  She acquired citizenship by birth in Botswana.  Unity's two other children, born after her marriage to Nathan Dow, have been denied Botswana citizenship.  Due to the Act they have different nationalities and rights than their siste, even though they have the same parents and reside in the same country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HRW also charges in &quot;Second Class Citizens&quot; that sex discrimination under the Citizenship Act severely curtails women's and children's other fundamental freedoms. Botswana women who have married foreign men are prevented from exercising the right to travel freely in and out of the country without leaving their children who, without Botswana passports, may not be readmitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, the Appeal Court found that the Citizenship Act interferes with Botswana women's freedom of marriage. By forcing Botswana women to weigh the negative consequences to their children of marrying foreign men, this law may dissuade them from marrying the men of their choice. These consequences include rendering the affected children potentially stateless, if they are unable to acquire their father's nationality for any reason. If they cannot acquire any country's passport, they would not be able to travel externally.  As aliens in their own country, the affected children also cannot vote or hold certain public offices. Moreover, they suffer discrimination in access to education since non-citizen children are admitted to public schools only when they do not jeopardize a citizen's chance of enrollment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report finds that more than two years after the Unity Dow decision, the Botswana government has yet to amend the Citizenship Act to end discrimination against women. Replying to the Unity Dow's application for passports for her two younger children, the Attorney General in July 1994 wrote that he has been &quot;unable to see the relevance of (the Appeal Court) judgment to the question of the issue of passports.  The government has also flouted the court's decision by denying passports to other children in similar situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Human Rights Watch is concerned that such defiance undermines the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary in Botswana.  It also sets a dangerous precedent for human rights in the region more generally since Botswana is often looked to as an example of good governance and democracy in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Based on the conclusions of &quot;Second Class Citizens,&quot; Human Rights Watch recommends that the government of Botswana urgently take the following steps:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Immediately enforce the decision of the Unity Dow case by amending section 4 of the Citizenship Act to allow children born in Botswana to a Botswana woman a foreign male to acquire Botswana citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -Amend other discriminatory sections of the Citizenship Act, particularly sections 5,6 and 12, to conform to international human rights standards of equality and nondiscrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -Consider amending the constitution expressly to include distinctions on the basis of sex in the definition of discrimination under section 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -Ratify the major international instruments protecting the rights of women and children, particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Human Rights Watch/Africa (formerly Africa Watch)&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Human Rights Watch is a non-governmental organization established in 1978 to monitor and promote the observance of internationally recognized human rights in Africa, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East and among the signatories of the Helsinki accords. It is supported by contributions from private individuals and foundations worldwide.  It accepts no government funds, directly or indirectly.  Its Africa division was established in 1988 to monitor and promote the observance of internationally recognized human rights in sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Women Rights Project was established in 1990 to monitor violence against women and gender discrimination throughout the world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> H.E. Nourredine Yazid Zerhouni</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C., September, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First of all, Mrs. Zerhouni and I would like to thank you all for attending our farewell party.  We are particularly honored to see so many of our friends this evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Throughout my tenure as Ambassador of Algeria to this great and beautiful country, I have above all tried to explain the complexity of the multi-faceted crisis that my country has been going through and which excludes any hasty or manichean evaluation likely to generate negative or counterproductive signals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, what is at stake in Algeria is not only an electoral issue: it is the pursuit of a genuine and irreversible democratic process based on pluralism and alternance to power with full respect of fundamental liberties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concurrently, radical economic reforms were launched to insure a sustained development in a framework of free enterprise, while at the same time avoiding to generate unbearable social inequalities.  In this respect, a couple of weeks ago, the International Monetary Fund issued a very positive report on the progress achieved by Algeria in the implementation of and commitment to the program of structural reforms reached earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, the pursuit of the democratic process and the implementation of radical reforms are the main objectives of the transitional period which Algeria has been going through since January of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to take up this challenge, H.E. President Liamine Zeroual has favored a political approach based on a responsible dialogue and on the involvement of all the leaders and organizations opposed to the use of violence and committed to upholding the Constitution and its fundamental principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This dialogue has two primary objectives: end to violence and organization of free elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and gentlemen: With your help, it has been possible to promote a greater interest for what is happening in Algeria.  I am convinced that this greater attention will bring about a better perception of the stakes and the challenges that are facing Algeria and the rest of our region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the conclusion of my mission, I am pleased to note that the United States Government, essentially supports our approach, condemns violence and avoids the dangerous mix up between Islam and extremism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also appreciate the interest manifested by US businesses for Algeria and their increasingly active participation in the development of a new type of partnership based on mutual interests and shared benefits and capable of taking the greatest advantage of the restructuring of our economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and Gentlemen, dear fellow Ambassadors and Charges d'Affaires:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Algeria does not expect her friends and partners to substitute themselves for her in facing the difficult responsibilities that are hers.  While we have always refused to interfere in the internal affairs of others, we also know that the solutions to our internal problems are to be found in Algeria alone and among Algerians: this is characteristic of our culture and one of our idiosyncrasies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, despite the pressure exerted by the current difficulties, Algeria has not failed to her regional or international obligations.  We have positively and in decisive moments contributed to the starting of the Middle East process and to its progress, as we have contributed to the resolution of conflicts taking place closer to our borders.  Several among our best diplomats have actively devoted their skills and energies to such tasks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our interest for cooperation in the Mediterranean area and in Africa, and more particularly, with our Mahgreb and Sub-Saharan neighbors, has not lessened either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, we continue to work for a just and real solution to the Western Sahara conflict based on as honest referendum for self-determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and gentlemen. before leaving this country, I would like to tell you that your availability and your friendly attention have been quite helpful in generating a better mutual understanding.  I am grateful to you for that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the members of the Algerian community in the United States for their awareness, their sensitivity and interest for everything that is happening in their homeland, as well as for their efforts to better communicate with their official representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This evening, I would also like to congratulate my fellow diplomats at the embassy who represent their country with dignity and patriotism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I will certainly not forget the constant devotion, commitment and efforts of the local staff of the embassy.  They have continuously improved their professionalism, and have always been available when called upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, I would like to express my gratitude and my deep appreciation to my family and more particularly to my wife Faitha for their committed support.  Thanks to them, my mission was easier to accomplish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you very much.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women's rights activists resolved at a Johannesburg comference at the weekend to lobby power to ensure women's equality becomes a reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Delegates at the three-day conference of the Women's National Coalition (WNC) met to chart the future role of the organisation after its mandate expired with the formunlation of the Charter for Effective Equality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The WNC and its affiliates will now build organisations, sttructures and lobbying power to ensure that women's equality becomes a reality,&quot; said Jean Ngubane, convener of the WNC which, according to its leaders, represents more than two million women.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said the country was in a state of flux and that &quot;most people are likely to relax and think that things are just going to work themselves out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We in the coalition feel this is actually the time we should be demanding that everything be done according to the charter or according to women's demands,&quot; she told a Press conference early this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference was also addressed by Dr. Sheila Meintjes, WNC outgoing deputy general secretary, who said the coalition would influence the composition of the Gender and Human Rights COmmissions and the Office of the Public Protector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These are the institutions that in a sense are going to be the most important in implemnting policy around women's issues. There is clearly a great need for us in the Women's National Coalition to interact closely with Government institutions to ensure that women are represented in the new bodies that are being structured now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ngubane said the confernce agreed that the working relationship with Government structures needed to be clearly worked out. The WNC would have to play a monitoring, facilitating and challenging role &quot;but not to agree to whatever Government gender policies are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr.Meintjes added: &quot;What we should be doing is to be looking to where power is located in Government and make that our point of pressure. To ensure that women's issues are not marginalised in the development of public policy and in the development of public institutions in this transformative period of South Africa's entry into a democratic society.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In September 1995, the fourth World Conference on Women will take place in Beijing, China. The gathering of women from the world is preceded by three world conferences in Mexico, 1975, Copenhagen, 1980 and Nairobi, 1985.  The objectives are to develop strategies vital to the assessment of the situation of women around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the last conference held almost 10 years ago in Nairobi, women at the conference developed what was termed as the Nairobi Forward Looking Strategy. The idea was developed in consideration of the state of women in the world which was assessed between 1975 and 1985.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prior to the start of the Beijing conference, African women will be converging in Dakar in November this year for the fifth series of African regional conferences on women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They will, as in the past, be taking stock of how far African women have progressed or retrogressed in the implementation of regional and global strategies and plans of actions adopted to advance women in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This fifth regional stock-taking follows four previous regional conferences which took place in Mauritania in 1977; Zambia in 1979; Tanzania in 1984; and Nigeria in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saffiatou Singhhateh is flying The Gambia's colours as the executive director of the African Women's Development and Communication Network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While on a visit here recently, she explained in an interview with the &quot;Daily Observer&quot; the essence of the Women's World Conference and the run-up to the African Preparatory Conference due to be held in Dakar in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said that despite efforts being made by governments in Africa, such as an increase in proclamations on women and a rise in the number of women in parliament, women still encounter problems with their basic survival. Some countries, she said, have set up women's bureaus. &quot;Some have impacts while others lack substance. It has been realized that ,&quot; she added, &quot;that some countries have focal points in women's affairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet almost two decades on, the concerns and issues which provoked those earlier regional conferences remain high on the agenda. There is much unfinished business to tackle in order to further women's advancement and to ensure their full participation in the region's developmental efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The preparatory conference in Dakar, coming as it does after the Abuja Declaration on Participatory Development, will be crucial for reviewing and matching real achievements in the region with the targets set in the Abuja Declaration, &quot;explained Mrs. Singhateh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like the third African regional conference of 1984 which came up with the Arusha strategies for the advancement of women and fed into the global Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies, adopted by consensus at the third World Conference, the Dakar meeting will serve as a regional preparatory meeting to the fourth World Conference on Women. &quot;It will review and appraise the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies and come up with the African platform for action which will be Africa's input into the global platform for action to be adopted in 1995.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From 4 to 15 September 1995, the fourth World Conference on Women will be staged in Beijing. Running concurrently with this inter-governmental meeting will be a forum for non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gertrude Mongella is secretary-general of the fourth World Conference on Women. She has been a strong advocate of women's rights. At a conference for African ministers responsible for economic development and planning in Addis Ababa last May, Mrs. Mongella urged African governments to facilitate the national and regional preparations for the world conference by providing both moral and financial support to the preparations, particularly at national level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I believe that Africa's development, and especially women's equality and their integration into development by the year 2000 and beyond, depend critically on the kinds of policies and development frameworks that are being put into place now at national, regional and international levels,&quot; Mrs.  Mongella asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The road from Nairobi through Abuja to Dakar with final destination in Beijing will be challenging for the African woman and therefore requires the full involvement and participation of all. The challenge is for us and we are confident that the whole region (women and men too) will rally to the cause in the crucial journey to Beijing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African running sensation Hezekiel Sepeng dreams of the day he stands on the winners rostrum at the Olympic Games as 800m champion of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believes that thorouogh planning and preparation contribute to the realisation of dreams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Right now, however, Sepeng is concentrating all his efforts on striking gold in the final matric exams next month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Potchefstroom Boys High pupil told ChalkLine that he was studying hard for his finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I missed loads of work while I was at the Commonwealth Games in Canada. Teachers assisted me with extra lessons on my return and I have managed to catch up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speneg, who will only race again early next year, said: &quot;I feel confident that I will do well in the exams.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 20-year-old, who rose from humble and poor beginnings as the son of a farmworker to an internationally known athlete, has applied to study public relations at Potchefstroom University next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has triumphed despite the severe disadvantages which go with being in a right-wing Western Transvaal town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent years he had to contend with racist comments from fellow pupils at the school. &quot;I feel hurt inside,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But I know I am not allowed to hit them.&quot; He stressed, however, that &quot;it is getting better now.&quot; Sepeng is the third eldest in a family of four boys and two girls.  Like his brothers, Sepeng has a strong passion for soccer.  &quot;But soccer and athletics do not go together,&quot; he told ChalkLine.  &quot;If you get injured in a soccer match before a big athletics meeting then you can't run,&quot; he said. &quot;So it is best to separate the two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few years ago Sepeng would not have in his wildest dreams imagined visiting countries such as Canada, Italy, Spain and Russia. He wishes that his father and mother, a domestic worker, could accompany him on one of his trips. But they don't have the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sepeng has a bright future in athletics. He is the current South African 800m champion and has been unbeaten in the past athletic season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has also won silver medals at the South African junior champinoships and at the international Stockholm athletics meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His advice to young athletes: &quot;Determination and hard work is the key.  Once you have made up your mind about what you want, go for it. Plan and you cannot go wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Chuka Momah, a sports analyst assumed the leadership of the Nigerian Lawn Tennis Association, NLTA, in May 1991, he promised that the association will lay emphasis on its junior development programme which is aimed at discovering new junior players and exposing those who had emerged.  At his inaugural press conference, Momah said his board which included veteran tennis stars like Thompson Onibokun, Lawrence Awopegba and Bowo Olagbegi, will set up a tennis academy where young players will be discovered, trained and exposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our aim is to expose as many children as we possibly can to the game of tennis. We would strive to ensure that the children in at least major cities of the country have a basic tennis knowledge,&quot; he declared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As if to prove his sencerity, Monah and his group indeed swung into action immediately. First, it set up a three-man coaching clinic headed by David Imonite, a former tennis player. The clinic was expected to translate into an academy. They also took a historic gamble in May 1992 when they did away with the services of Nduka Odizor, Nigeria's most prominent tennis player who had represented the country since 1986, to try junior players in a Davis Sup tie against Morocco. They experimented with Sule Ladipo, Emmanuel Udozor, Kyrian Nwokedi and Yakubu Suleiman, who were all teenagers at that time. Although, the team lost to Morocco 5-0, it launced the boys to big time tennis as they started performing well in international circuits. For once, it seemed as if Nigerian tennis had come of age and that the country now had replacements for Odizor, who had dominated the tennis scene for over a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hope soon faded when Alex Akinyele, the then chairman of National Sports Commission, NSC, without any reason dissolved the Momah-led board and replaced it with a new one headed by Kofi Fidelis, a brigadier-general whose resignation as chairman in 1991 led to the inauguration of the Momah-led board. The first decision taken by the board was to discontinue Momah's experimentation with junior players as they brought Odizor back into the country's Davis Cup team. Fidelis said then that he took the decision because Odizor despite having dropped off Association of Tennis Players, ATP, singles ranking remained the best Nigerian tennis player. &quot;It is true Odizor had lost form. He can still beat any of the Nigerian players even immediately after waking up from sleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was proved wrong as the Odizor-led team crumbled 5-0 to Romania in the Euro-African Zone Two play-off in April last year. This forced Fidelis to resort to the junior team in subsequent matches. But then the damage had been done. Most of the junior players, like Mohammed and Nwokedi, who were studying abroad had lost form because they could not play in the international circuits. They only played collegiate tennis to retain their scholarship. The new NLTA which should have helped them with funds seemed to lackj interest. They even suspended the ides of the academy for lack of funds. Only Sule Landipo, the current best player in the country managed to remain afloat, thanks to Rolf Wegner, his German trainer and sponser, who took over the management of his career immediately he left high school in Nigeria. He is now ranked 254 in the world and is a member of the International Tennis Federation, ITF, world touring team. This situation is symptomatic of the inconsistent policies by different helmsmen that have bedevilled Nigerian tennis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even now that Momah has been brought back by Sylvanus Akinwumi, who replaced Akinyele as NSC chairman, the junior development programme still remains a step away from success. Momah himself admits this much at an interview with Newswatch. He blames the situation on lack of enthousiasm among players, indiscipline, over-ambition and inadequate funds. The first major step in having a successful youth programme, he says, &quot;is to have the kids willing to pay the price and make the sacrafice.&quot; He adds that is after this that one can start talking about money which he admits is a crucial factor in tennis development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lack of money has indeed been a major factor responsible for the decline in the fortunes of tennis in Nigeria. Erstwhile ATP recognised local international championships like Ogbe Hard Court, Okada Tennis Tournament, Lord Runners Classics which used to serve as launching pads for local players have been suspemded by ITF when they failed to meet the federation's standard. One of the rules set by ITF and which Nigerian sponsers of the championships have not been able to meet lately is that prize money for such championships be deposited with Men's International Tennis Council, MITC, six months in advance. Scarcity of foreign exchange and the fluctuation in the exchange rate of the naira has made the condition practically impossible to meet by Nigerian sponsors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, Ajsomo Alabi, who is the sole financier of the $75,000 prizemoney, Lord Rumen Classic requires about N3.8 million minus operational cost, to organise the tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The suspension of these championships which gave Odizor vital ATP points in his days has been a great loss to budding tennis players in Nigeria. The situation is made worse because the NLTA is unable to raise enough money to send them to international circuits. &quot;Right now, we are looking for money to send Godwin Omuta and Emmanuel Ehirim to participate in satellite tournaments. But where do we get a sponsor who will be willing to invest between $20,000 and $30,000 on each of the players for three years before they become self-sufficient?&quot;, Momah asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hauwa-Kulu Akinyemi, secretary of NLTA while echoing Momah's views said that what the board does at the moment is to send junior players to junior championships in the sub-region where they could be picked by ITF for training. Three teenagers, Osaro Amandi, Sunday Maku and Lucy Michael were picked at last year's junior lawn tennis championship in Abidjan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe and South Africa have established a working group of senior government officials to review the outdated 1964 trade agreement and propose amendments aimed at enhancing two-way trade between Southern Africa's two largest economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials from the two countries, who met in Pretoria recently, have started consultations to investigate aspects of the agreement which need amending, before meeting again by the end of November this year to report back on their findings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Businessmen in Zimbabwe are anxious that a new preferential trade pact be signed, to allow them to widen their share of the South African market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Industry sources in Harare said South Africa should remove or reduce punitive tariffs on selected products, such as textiles and clothing, as the first step towards enhancing bilateral trade, currently amounting to over R875-million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa slapped high import tariffs on textile products more than two years ago, mainly to protect its own industry from cheap imports from the Far East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The action by South Africa severely affected the Zimbabwean textile sector, which was forced to retrench more than 5,000 workers during the past 18 month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is against this background that Zimbabwean businessmen are urging President Robert Mugabe's government to press for an early conclusion to the talks, which were started in 1992 but suspended just before South Africa's elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presidents Nelson Mandela and Mugabe have expressed their commitment to a speedy resolution, saying it would promote development in the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ITT, a private American conglomerate, has won a contract to manage debt straddled Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB), the country's largest money house, according to the latest issue of the London-pubblished Africa Analysis newsletter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UCB's story has been a litany of mismanagement, lending malpractices and corruption. Over an eight-year period, the bank gave out loans totalling Shs. 52.3bn ($52.3m) which it has failed to recover.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, as in the past, Africa Analysis warns, the debt-recovery exercise may get caught up in the web of local politics: many defaulters are high-ranking members of the government who are not keen on paying up. Some want the state to write off the debts, or cut them by half. The government is unlikely to oblige, and it has accepted to set up a Non-performing Loans Recovery Trust to clear the debts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The newsletter also says that American organisations have virtually taken control of Uganda's commercial banks in an effort to save them from collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bail-out, it says, is being spearheaded by USAID and ITT. Other American corporations are also expected to participate in the proposed restructuring of the Bank of Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ITT (whose stable includes Sheraton Corporation, Hartford Insurance and ITT Rayonier) has sent in three specialists to help manage credit control, financial services and bank inspection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They will also advise on a planned revision of UCB's 1965 act of incorporation - seen as vital for revitalising a bank which accounts for 60 percent of all credit in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> USAID is providing a $13m loan to the Co-operative Bank to shore up its capital reserves and stem losses, which reached Shs.2bn ($3.2m) in 1993.  The bank is burdened with non-performing loans - liabilities outstrip assets by U. Shs. 5.4bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> USAID has made the help for the Co-operative Bank conditional on radical cost-cuts. Staff numbers and the vehicle fleet are being pared down.  The benefits are beginning to show: operating losses are down by 93 percent.  Managing director Godfrey Nsubuga hopes for a profit this year and next and has announced plans to strengthen the bank's share capital with an injection of U.Shs. 300m ($300,000) in new money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from the scandalous political loans totalling U.Shs. 52.3bn.  ($52.3m) over the past three years UCB has lost $12m on a rural credit scheme, after failing to impress on farmers the need to repay loans that many thought were grants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria and South Africa, the two strongest economies in Africa, are coming together in new trade partnerships made possible by the recent political reforms in the former apartheid state. It is a partnership informed by economic realities in the two countries and the need for the two economies to build new trade alliances which they desperately need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are the two major economies in Africa,&quot; says Stephen Akinwolere, director-general of the Nigerian-South African Chamber of Commerce, NISAC, &quot;and we must operate together. South Africa has the most developed market in Africa. Nigeria is the most extensive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, a trade delegation from the National Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture, NACCIMA, left Lagos for Johannesburg, South Africa, for an exploratory trade visit to the country. The team is expected to sign bilateral trade agreements and reach a cooperative arrangements with the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delegation is the second from Nigeria to South Africa in the past month. Early September, officials of the NISAC spent 10 days in South Africa on its first preliminary business visit to that country. The 23-man team, led by Olu Adegbite and Stephen Akinwolere, president and director general of NISAC, met with officials of the South African Foreign Trade Organisation, SAFTO, as well as the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce. At the end of the visit, the team signed a six-point mutual cooperation agreement, which among others provide for the hosting of an international seminar on trade between the two countries. The seminar is planned to hold in Lagos in next March.  Both sides expect that a major trade policy will emerge at the end of the seminar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As one of the emerging markets, South Africa's economy is said to worth $100 billion, bigger than the economies of half of the continent. The capitalisation of its main stock exchange, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is put at $150 million, according to a report by the World Economic Forum, WEF, released at its last meeting in Cape Town, South Africa in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is far ahead of the capitalisation of the stock exchanges in all other African countries combined. The WEF report puts the combined capitalisation of the stock exchanges in five countries with vibrant capital markets in Africa at $12 million. The countries include Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African businesses find Nigeria attractive because it is the second strongest economy in the continent and the most extensive market. They are seeking to establish close working relations with Nigerian businesses.  Says Charles Kuzmanitch, former head of the Africa desk at the South African Trade Organisation, SAFTO, &quot;Nigeria and South Africa being the two strongest economies in Africa have got to look at joint efforts in the development of their regions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAFTO has since 1993 organised visits by six trade delegations to Nigeria. Another visit planned for June was postponed indefinintely because of the political crisis in Nigeria and the tension it generated. &quot;Nigeria is a very good market for us to take clients into,&quot; Kuzmanitch told &quot;NEWSWATCH&quot;.  &quot;We have taken six groups since we started. One reason why group visits to Nigeria has been so successful is that people are concerned about doing business with Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said 13 of the 15 people he took to Nigeria in 1993 have &quot;done business and a number of them are going back to do business.&quot; Most of these businesses have been in the area of marketing investments. But he said service companies are also showing remarkable interest. We have service companies looking at Nigeria. Trade mark attorneys, patent attorneys, companies involved in the service area are asking to see what they can do in Nigeria,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The interest in Nigeria reflects the zeal with which South African businesses want to take on international businesses. During the days of sanctions, most South African businesses traded in extreme secrecy. There were markets that they could not attempt to enter directly. Nigeria, with its leading role in its fight against apartheid, was one such markets. Products meant for the Nigerian market were usually shipped to Cote D'Ivoire from where they were transfered into Nigeria, usually with the country of origin missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A report by SAFTO, for instance, showed major transit points like Namibia, Lesotho, Zaire and Mauritius and Cote D'Ivoire as South Africa's major trading partners. These countries also served as the major transit point for exports to South Africa. Take oil for instance. That country bought Nigerisn oil regularly through indirect channels, and it may be Nigeria itself,&quot; Kuzmanitch said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In most of the front-line states Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania- South Africa has remained a major trading partner for many years.&quot; In the case of Zimbabwe, South Africa has always been our major trading partner&quot; said Godfry Gomwe, chief executive officer of Cluff Resources, Zimbabwe, which owns the largest gold mine in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is happening now, Gomwe explains is that South Africa has moved into the playing field. Since the end of trade sanctions against it, trade has become an open affair. According to SAFTO's figures, South African export to Nigeria grew from about five million South African Rands (about $1.4 million, $1 = R3.6) in 1992 to R40 million in 1993, largely because of the end of trade sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African desperately needs Nigerian oil. This country rich in precious metals like diamond, gold, uranium, iron ore and copper, does not have crude oil. &quot;South Africa has got almost everything it needs in the industrial side except oil,&quot; said Kuzmanitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In looking to Nigeria it hopes to be able to import crude and the by-produccts. But more than that it wants to develop a market here for products from its industries. South African businesses are looking forward to replacing Western suppliers for the equipment required by the oil industry.  And with strong agricultural and automative sectors, they are also looking forward to exporting finished and semi-finished agricultural and automative products to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian businesses are alos rushing to South Africa. Shehu Malami, chairman of Asea Brown Boveri, enjoys a high profile in the business community there. Last year, ABB moved the headquarters of its sub-Saharan department from Zurich to Johannesburg. That department carters for Nigeria and all the electricity transformers that ABB has been shipping into Nigeria have been comming from Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malami remains the only non-South African director of Africa Initiative, an organisation formed in Johannesburg in 1993 to promote economic and commercial initiative across the continent. &quot;I have a lot of confidence in South Africa,&quot; he told NEWSWATCH. His hopes is that South Africans would not only see Nigeria as a good market but a place to invest in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kuzmanitch says heavy infrastructural investments by South Africans in Nigeria may not be immediate because &quot;South Africa is not a rich country as we are thought to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Yes, we are a strong country. Yes, we arre a wealthy country but we do not have the capacity to mobilise external funds. We have been in a recession and we are trying to pick our way out of it. South Africa does not have enough money for its own needs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is likely to happen is that the two countries will look towards joint venture partnership. &quot;There are some technologies we can get from Nigeria, and there are some that we can give to Nigeria. We do not think of Nigeria in terms of products. We think of Nigeria in terms of cooperative ventures, he said. Akinwolere too says NISAC is not &quot;looking at South Africa as a distributive market centre. We want to import South Africa's technology in exchange for Nigeria's variety of products and native intelligence. We don't see them as another trading outpost but as a trading partner with good heritage from which we can draw.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africas 20-year decline in per capita incomes is set to continue for most countries despite consensus from forecasters on faster growth this year and, says the World Bank, for the rest of the decade.  The latest predictions from multilateral institutions suggest growth for 1994 of 2.0-3.4 per cent, against annual population growth of some 3 per cent.  In its relatively bullish forecast, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts growth rising to 4.5 per cent in 1995.  All reviews, however, agree on Africa's &quot;precarious and disturbing&quot; economic situation, the conclusion drawn by Mr.Layashi Yaker, Executive Secretary of the UN's Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), in a 1994 review of African economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The higher growth projections hinge mainly on an upturn in commodity prices.  But having reached their lowest levels ever in real terms in 1993, the roughly 5 per cent improvement in prices being predicted will not be sufficient to stimulate the growth needed to significantly improve living conditions for most Africans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The prognosis for overall growth in (the sub-Saharan African) region is sobering... income per capita and, more important, private consumption per capita are unlikely to see much increase for a third decade in a row,&quot; says the World Bank's &quot;Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries&quot;.  Its prediction of average 3.9 per cent growth over the next decade is higher than earlier forecasts, but is still well short of the 5 per cent plus needed to reverse the fall in incomes.  If the fate of earlier forecasts is repeated, the Bank's low-growth estimate of 2.4 per cent will prove more realistic and incomes will continue to decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Growth&quot;--Last year was another disaster for Africa, with overall growth just 1-1.5 per cent. Since 1990, African economies have grown an average 1.3 per cent which, the ECA says, means a yearly fall in per capita income of 1.7 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, experience was diverse.  Oil exporters recorded their lowest growth since 1988, reports the UN's &quot;World Economic and Social survey 1994&quot;.  Central African countries suffered most, with gross domestic product (GDP) down 4.6 per cent.  East African countries fared best, though 2.6 per cent growth was still below the rate of population increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Encouragingly, says the ECA, 11 countries (up from seven in 1992) enjoyed growth of 5 per cent or more.  This covered some 20 per cent of Africa's population.  GDP failed to match population growth in 30 out of 51 countries in 1993, four less than in 1992.  But countries averaging growth of 5 per cent or more since the mid-1980s cover under 3 per cent of Africa's population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia exemplifies how misleading the figures on Africa can be.  Estimated 1993 GDP growth of 9.3 per cent says more about the economy's rebound from earlier devastation than about current living standards.  This year the country is facing the worst famine since 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the IMF'S &quot;World Economic Outlook&quot;, North African economies should experience a stronger performance in 1994.  And for South Africa, most forecasts expect progress from around 1 per cent in 1993 to some 3 per cent in 1994.  Unlike the ECA, which points more cautiously to the short-term costs of the CFA franc devaluation in January, the IMF predicts a turnround in franc zone economies, with the exception of Cameroon, followed by strong growth in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Trade&quot;--A surge in the price of most commodities in the first half of 1994 has reinforced hopes of a general upturn in growth for Africa this year.  A strong showing by oil prices in the second quarter could mean a better-than-forecast performance by oil exporters.  After six years of watching prices decline ot their lowest level ever, cocoa and coffee producers could enhoy a 25 and 50 per cent increase in prices respectively between 1993 and 2000.  Only copper, iron ore, oil, tea and tobacco out of Africa's manor exports face a downturn in real terms in 1994, says the World Bank.  And t o date, both copper and oil are defying that trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With better prospects for commodities, the UN is predicting positive terms of trade for African economies in 1994, a 2.5 per cent improvement, for the first time since 1990.  In 1993, Africa's terms of trade fell between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent, causing a loss of at least $3 bn, while imports rose only marginally to $75.9bn, according to the ECA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Finance&quot;--Private financial flows are booming everywhere but Africa, the UN reports in its 1994 &quot;World Economic and Social Survey&quot;.  Private outflows from Africa rose to over $61e ban in 1993 from $53.5 bn in 1992 as capital flight continued and foreign investors stayed away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Official transfers rose to close to $82 bn, up a relatively healthy 11 per cent. But there is a &quot;considerable risk&quot; of lower net resource flows to Africa, the World Bank warns, as donor cutbacks and competing claims dig into Africa's share of the aid pie.  The UN reports that net transfers of financial resources to Africa were still negative, but at $200 mn, represented the smallest outflow since the negative trend began in 1990.  For sub-Saharan Africa (excluding Nigeria and South Africa), net transfers were down, at $8.6 bn from $9.8 bn in 1992, but still positive and still up on late-1980s levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ECA and the African Development bank estimate that Africa's stock of debt rose to $285.4 bn in 1993, from $278.8 bn in 1992, equivalent to almost 96 per cent of GDP. For sub-Saharran Africa, the debt burden rose to over 123 percent of GDP (113.9 per cent in 1992).  Debt-service, however, declined to the equivalent of 24.4 percent of African export earnings (from 26.3 per cent in 1992).  Sub-Saharan Africa's ratio fell dramatically to 13.2 per cent from 18.8 per cent, says the ECA.  But this reflects a growing inability to pay rather the success of debt relief efforts, which continue to be inadequate, all reviews note.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the last few years of the Ibrahim Bagangida administration, there was a growing sensitivity to th federal character question. According to an informed source, the government had perfected a strategy on the manner of release of hte names of appointees to federal positions. It was a kind of name-arranging game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whenever names of appointees were to be released by the government to the public through the media, the conventional formats didn't seem to matter, not alphabetical order of names or of states, not necessarily seniority of officers or sex (ladies first) of appointees. The government had noted based on observation that it was necessary to mix the order in which the names appeared, so that names of people from one ethnic group were not bunched up, rather they were all scattered throughout the list. The scattering strategy was to remove the impression of concentration and make the weight of numbers from certain ethnic groups not too massive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But trust Nigerians. They will find out truth. They reach for their calcultors and do the numbers game: they pick out from their book shelves a book titled &quot;How to Identify Tribes from names&quot; And work it all out. That way they know whether their ethnic group has been short-changed or whether this time they're in or out, or in but not quite in or whether this time they have, again, been, to use a favorite buzzword, marginalised.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This name-scattering game didn't always result in a win for the government, no matter how hard it tried. A few years ago, Babangida was severely criticised for lopsidedness in the composition of the Armed Forces Ruling Council, AFRC. His reply: &quot;There is no north, no south. No Christianity and no Islam. Merit is the only consideration. &quot;His words were a good political slogan, suitable for an election campaign. It was a statement on the Ideal Nigeria, the one we are yet to attain, not a statement on teh Real Nigeria, the one in which we currently live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a country like Nigeria with some 250 ethnic groups and 513 languages and dialects, any leader who satisfies all these interests must have to have a superhuman, legendary powers. In a heterogeneous federation, the central government must remain the glue that binds the federating states by the representativeness of its appointments and the fairness of its actions generally. It was via the view to addressing the problem of domination and its flip side, marginalisation, that the Constitution Drafting Committee, argued that &quot;in view of Nigeria's history of inter-ethnic rivalry to secure the domination of government by one ethnic group or a combination of ethnic groups to the exclusion of others, it is essential to have some provisions to ensure that the predominance of persons from a few states or from a few ethnic or other sectional groups is avoided in the composition of government or election of persons to high offices in the state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were obliged. For the first time the concept of federal character was inserted in the 1979 constitution. Section 14(3) states that , &quot;That composition of the government of the federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of its affairs shall be carried out in such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria and the need to promote national unity and also to command national lolalty, therby ensuing that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few states or from a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that government or in any of its agencies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Has the implementation of the federal character principle promoted national unity and commanded national loyalty? It is doubtful. First, the policy is actually difficult to implement, and secondly, the implementation is done selectively. How do you reflect federal character? By numerical equality or representativeness of ethnic groups or of geographical spread or should amenities be allocated by number or by worth? At what level of appointment should quota or proportionality be applied - at the entry point or at more senior level? How do you acheive proportionality without sacraficing quality or merit or efficiency or morale within the public service?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In February, 1992, some fellows who identified themselves as &quot;Admirers of AAA&quot; had inserted a satirical advert in some newspapers. It was headed &quot;Congratulations&quot; and it ran thus: &quot;We must heartily congratulate the Hon.  Minister of Finance and Sardauna of Sokoto, Alhaji Abubakar Alhaji on his recent appointments of chief executives of the 13 federal government controlled commercial and merchant banks. The appointments are a demonstration of the indefitable minister's evenhandedness and unflinching commitment to the federal structure of Nigeria. The following breakdown proves this to the hilt: Hausa/ Fulani7; Yoruba5; Igbos1; Northern Minorities0; Southern Minorities0.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The names of the managing directors and the banks were listed. The advert was rounded off with &quot;All Hail One Nigeria,&quot; a satirical commentary on what could be a drawback to having one united Nigeria, which has been the refrain of most, if not all Nigerian leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of the circumstance of the marriage, a kind of shotgun marriage between the Northern and Southern Protectorates in 1914, virtually every Nigerian leader has preached the sermon of &quot;a united Nigeria.&quot; Here were two territories similar in several but different in many respects including culture, religion and education being merged in a marriage of convenience. The overt incompatability inherent in that marriage gave birth to the expression &quot;unity in diversity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In apparent acknowledgement of the difficulty in welding such groups together, Nigerian leaders never failed to harp on the unity theme in their public speeches. Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Nigeria's first prime minister and Nnamdi Azikiwe, first president, all preached from time to time the sermon of national unity. Even Chukwuma Nzeogwu, the army major whose January 1966 coup ended up disuniting the country, started off on a optimistic declaration &quot;to establish a strong, united and prosperous nation, free from corruption and internal strife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quite ironically it was in the bid to establish unity that J.T.U.  Aguiyi-Ironsi, the major-general who inherited the federal government from Nzeogwu that he, Ironsi, opted for a unitary system of government which was opposed by the north. While past leaders of the Nigerian federation had made declaration now and again on what ought to be the nation's guiding objectives it was not until October 1970 that the nation had a clear-cut set of objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yakubu Gowon, in launching the Second National Development Plan 1970-74, listed five national objectives: (a) A united , strong and self-reliant nation, (b) A great and dynamic economy, (c) A just and egalitarian society, (d) A free and democratic society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government published a booklet titled &quot;National Guidelines for thwe Protection of Nigeria's Philosophy and Action&quot; to explain its goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of these objectives have been given lip-service by various governments emphasised on depended on the problems it faced at the time and its visions of how to tackle them. In his inaugural address July 29, 1974 Murtala Muhammed who overthrew the Gowon government that had been accused of drifting and condoning corruption, talked of sacrafice, self-discipline and declared that his &quot;government will not condone abuse of office.&quot; He went ahead and sanctioned 10 out of Gowon's 12 governors and purged the public service of the corrupt and indolent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his famous Jaji address in September 1977 Olusegun Obasanjo, who stepped in after Muhammed's assassination February 13, 1976, described the Nigeria &quot;we are aspiring to build as a disciplined, fair, just and humane African society.&quot; Shehu Shagari who took over from Obasanjo as president in 1979 said that &quot;our domestic policies will be geared towards making Nigeria a united, peaceful and economically self-reliant nation&quot; at a dinner on the eve of his inauguration. His economic policies which were marred by corruption, profligacy and the large-scale of both necessaries and luxuries were not likely to lead to realisation of &quot;an economically self-reliant nation.&quot; But his strength was his faith in the slogan &quot;One nation, One Destiny&quot; which he tried totranslate into reality not only by shooting his forefinger into the sky but in actually trying to extend his friendship to political foes across the land. His effort met with several road blocks: the Bendel State Government attempted to stop him from visiting the state, the Oyo State Government demolished some federal government houses in the area, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Muhammadu Buhari government faced with the political rascality of the politicisans his government had just sacked and the tottering economy they left behind gound himself in a war-mongering mood. He declared on taking over as head of state January 1,1984: &quot;This government will not tolerate kickbacks, inflation of contracts and over-invoicing of imports nor will it condone forgery, fraud, embezzlement, misuse and abuse of office and illegal dealings in foreign exchange and smuggling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many people admitted that his government had instituted sanity into the chaotic life of the Nigerian and had made a bold effort to control the leakages in the economy but they objected to the government's use of the tactics of a drill sergant, the extreme step of killing trakkickers, detaining people without trial. Perhaps, the chink in his government moral armour was the 53 suitcases which passed through the airport unchecked at a time that the government had insisted everyone and every luggage must pass through the needle's eye of a rigorous search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His successor, Ibrahim Babangida, declared on assumption of office August 27, 1985: &quot;Let us all dedicate ourselves to the cause of building a strong, united and viable nation for the sake of our own lives and the benefit of prosperity.&quot; We probably dedicated to this cause. We embarked on political restructuring of the country through the creation of more states and local governments. We tried a restructuring of the economy through privatisation, a measure of deregulaiton, creation of new financial institutions, devaluation and debt management but lapses in policy implementation, exemptions through the back door corrupt practices and frequent policy changes have successfully stalled the growth of the economy, and stymied our hope for an early recovery. What's more, the inexplicable annulment of the June 12,1993 election has left the country weak and deeply divided and made the talk of a united nation academic. The rowdy debates at the Constitutional Conference last week, testify to this. Babangida's characterisation of the state of the nation on his assumption of office was that of &quot;a bewildered nation.&quot; At his exit, the country could be characterised as a beleagured nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two governments that have followed the Babangida government, the Ernest Shonekan government christened &quot;a child of circumstance&quot; and the Sani Abacha government dressed as &quot;a child of necessity&quot; have harped, understandably on the unity theme. Shonekan's desire was to move the country foward as a &quot;united , indivisable nation,&quot; while Abacha seeks to &quot;bulid a united and peaceful Nigeria.&quot; Since Babangida's exit &quot;unity&quot; and &quot;peace&quot; have been quite elusive because of the post election trauma. The search for both must obviously mean the subordination of other national objectives. However, &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;justice&quot; have, in the past one year or so become much more than indefinable philosophical concepts. They've grown into tangible, touchable props on which the nation's present and future ride. They present themselves in various forms: June 12, Ogoni and Co, Madueke and Chris Alli, revenue alloocation, you can add to the list. But the struggle for fairness and justice is not limited by time or space. It is a universal struggle, one that transcends Nigeria and transcends Abacha's government. They're not isssues that'll go away tomorrow morning or the day after because the way the world is arranged, human beings and groups prefer to hold on to what they have, they prefer to enjoy the comforts that privileged settings offer, they prefer to be in a situation that gives them a head start all the time, they prefer if they can, to put the other guy in his place, that is below them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gowon's definition of our national objectives is the most comprehensive. It remains the benchmark. If we have not achieved all or even most of them it is because we have adopted, over the years, policies that are disincentive to unity, to the erection of a just and egalitarian society, in education, politics, economy, in appointments, in the provision of amenities, in the sharing of our national patrimony. We have failed to tackle decisively such monsters as corruption, proflgacy, mismanagement, ethnicity, religious and other forms of fanaticism; We have failed to cut down root and branch the evils that have haunted us for 34 years. We make beautiful constitutions but we never let them work. We formulate beautiful policies but we deface them by creating sacred cows. We are fortunate to have wealth dropped on our laps but we're so greedy we want to steal everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To remake Nigeria we must start afresh, keep our objectives in sight and work honestly, assiduously, selflessly towards those goals. We may not always achieve the ideal but we must be seen to be working towards it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">720 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recent criticism by the ANC of the treatment it has received in the press has generated much concern in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many in the press community have thrown their hands up in protest against suggestions from government, and particularly the ANC, that newspapers have been unnecessarily critical of the new administration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Party has warned that utterances from within the ANC did not bode well for press freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And others in the media world have interpreted comments by President Mandela and his deputy Thabo Mbeki as an ominous signal of dark days to come.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We in the independent media community know better than most what the denial of press freedom means.  We endured it in its most unadulterated form under the National Party government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This newspaper was banned twice in terms of the state of emergency and numerous other times in terms of the Publications Control Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We should therefore have been in the forefront to lead the chorus against the threat to press freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But we are concerned that those who have been most vocal in their protests have ignored the fact that the greatest threat to press freedom has been the monopolization of the mass media in the hands of a tiny white minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is reflected, not only in the ownership of the media, but also in the staffing at senior levels of South Africa's major newspapers by white men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without any doubt press freedom in this context translates into little more than the freedom to ensure that government can be criticized-- but only to the extent that the interests of big business are protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not much more can really be expected of newspapers owned by big business.  Nevertheless it is their democratic right and must not be tampered with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it needs to be said that the role of media in general goes beyond safeguarding the interests of a fraction of a narrow constituency, despite its economic predominance in society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are also the interests of the vast majority, which has over centuries been disempowered economically and, until April this year, politically as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, their aspirations and interests have hardly found adequate expression in the established mass media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the protests recently heard are to translate into anything meaningful, newspaper monopolies will have to begin shedding some of the control they have over the mass media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meaningful steps must be taken to ensure that ownership of newspapers and control begin to reflect the demographics of South African society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It needs to be said that this empowerment we advocate must translate into genuine control and go beyond economic empowerment which only addresses monetary imbalances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It must mean political empowerment as well, because it is only those who stand to benefit most from the new democracy that can be trusted to defend it with any genuine commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unless the media monopolies act decisively in this regard, there is the real risk that press freedom will be reduced to little more than a fetish that will not help consolidate the country's hard-earned democracy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Yoweri Museveni has okayed a deal which is very bad news for corrupt politicians, government officials and managers of state-owned companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently Museveni agreed to open up government and parastatals' books of accounts for external examination in return for a reduction of Uganda's US$2.6 bn (Ug. Shs. 2.6 trillion) debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president's Press Secretary, Ms. Hope Kivengere, confirmed to The Monitor that President Museveni proposed at a reception held in his honour in London June this year that donors were free to inspect the government books since his government had nothing to hide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the London-based centre for Accountability and Debt Relief, Museveni &quot;offered a unique challenge to World Bank and IMF which hold Uganda's debt in recognition of the government's committment to keep its financial affairs fully transparent, accountable and subject to continuing audit.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The donors are certain to find all the evidence that the NRC's Public Accounts Committee has been stumbling on the shocking cases of corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An informed source told The Monitor that; &quot;even if that was the case, an agreement could be reached to tie the reduction levels to progress on eliminating corruption and embezzlement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the Museveni proposal fires up, Uganda could well become the first country in the developing world to benefit from a debt reduction package agreed upon during the last conference of industrialized nations in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni's ideas were warmly welcomed by the influential Centre for Accountability and Debt Relief which said that &quot;Museveni's offer should be seen as the correct way forward for all troubled borrowers world wide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NRM government has been tainted by corruption, partly because of its failure to crack-down on corruption. In some instances, people linked to corruption have been promoted, giving the view that the government-at worst- has chosen to turn a blind eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni has himself spoken in very terse terms about corruption and threatened to take drastic action, but beyond brave words, he has still shied away from the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the London meet, Museveni also pledged to bring all available resources to bear against corruption by any of his own government ministers and civil servants. This time though, the price for stemming graft is attractive and there might be some credible action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The donor community has promised to waive off part of Uganda's debt after auditing all the other monies that have been loaned to Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's economic recovery and liberalisation has impressed the donor community (even if less so Ugandans) and was lauded at the recent consultive meeting in Paris which who gave US$820m for the budget year 1994/1995. This was more than the Uganda government had requested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the London meeting Museveni is reported to have said that it is not a good idea to wipe off entirely the whole debt because this might give a wrong signal, that nations can incur debts and not pay back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If implemented Uganda will become the second country after Tanzania to open its books to external examination. In May this year the government in Dar es Salaam allowed donors working with the Auditor-General to audit ministries, parastatall and NGO's to curb misuse of donor funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a London newsletter Africa Analysis, governments which went by the IMF reform programmes and have a reliable record of debts payments would be extended the cancellation of some of their debt owed to the Paris club.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1187 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a brilliant soul-searching speech that will be remembered for long in the Constituent Assembly (CA), former Tanzanian President Mwalimu Julius Nyerere yesterday tackled the twin issues of tribalism and national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The graying socialist, in his signature collar-less suit, was a guest speaker to the CA fourth of a six -day visit to Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tribalism was clearly on top of Nyerere's agenda.  Nyerere, who quit politics voluntarily in 1985, said he shared with the delegates his shock when he came to Uganda as a student in 1943, when he witnessed how tribalism and religious bigotry were over-played here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We had more tribes in Tanzania than in Uganda and Kenya put together, but I think we succeeded in defeating tribalism,&quot; Nyerere said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he had even abolished the business of asking for people's religions and tribes during the Population Census.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We as the government do not give service to Christians as Christians, so why do we want to know how many Christians there are?&quot; Nyerere recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nyerere remembered someone once asking him how many Catholics (like himself), were cabinet ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I thought and thought; and other than myself, there was only one other Catholic,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And he was a polygamist!&quot; (the delegates roared with laughter).  Nyerere said that he did not even know which tribe or religion his cabinet ministers belonged to , and preached the doctrine of de-emphasizing the tribe to build nations in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;African countries are new, artificial, vulnerable and the only entity that is understood and is natural is the tribe,&quot; Mwalimu said.  He came even closer home, to Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What future is there in Batooro, Banyoro?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no future there at all.  It is absolutely useless; emphasizing your tribe is absurd!&quot; Nyerere said, as the Assembly reverberated with applause.  More than a few heads were bowed in despair, as the words against tribalism sunk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nyerere gave the example of European countries, built over hundreds of years, but which are still looking for unity up to now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These countries were built by Kings and Queens, supported by armies, not by political parties,&quot; he said, adding that only African countries were being built by political parties.  He wanted to stop here because he thought they knew what he meant, but delegates--thirsting for more, urged him on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that Western democracies, strong and united as they are, &quot;still perceive this unity as not enough and they are looking to a higher unity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Europeans are doing this so that they can face the 1 billion Chinese, the Japanese, the Americans,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We in Africa, in 1994, we are still thinking in terms of tribes.  What chance can we have in the 21st century?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a gesture of humility, Nyerere also conceded that he, and his generation of African leaders, tried to create an East African Federation.  And failed which shamed him sometimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We lost; but I am saying that don't give up.  Every generation achieves what it can.  For us we got rid of colonialism,&quot; Nyerere said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Your generation should think of the future of the continent.&quot; Unknown to Nyerere of course was that many delegates he was addressing were not of this generation, and that some were actually around before his time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a word of counsel for African leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Africa cannot afford unprincipled leaders at all,&quot; he said.  He begged the delegates to give Uganda a chance, a new lease on life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He recalled the glorious years of Uganda, the Pearl of Africa, the place where everybody, including himself, came to study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You have suffered too much, you lost all those years,&quot; Nyerere said, in a halting, breaking voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He implored Ugandans to preach &quot;peace and stability&quot; and work for it too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Peace and stability are not like this morning's rain, which fell without you asking it!&quot; he said comically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Building a country requires intelligence and hard work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Breaking up a country does not require any intelligence at all!&quot; he said indignantly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He gave as example, the Russian Parliament Building in Moscow which was razed by tanks while a journalist standing nearby (CNN) described its demise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He said that this building took 20 years to build; now it is taking 20 minutes to destroy,&quot; Nyerere recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mwalimu implored the delegates not to dream of the things in Europe and America, implying the luxuries of multi-parties, which he advised should be shelved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After his beautiful 45 minute speech, Nyerere was given an unprecedented standing ovation, as well as a bouquet from CA Chairman James Wapakhabulo who called Nyerere &quot;one of the leading sons of Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wapakhabulo remembered how many Ugandans took refuge in Nyerere's Tanzania during the bad times, &quot;and I am sure if I asked them to stand up here, there would be a forest!&quot; Wapa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ambassador Katenta Apuuli (CP Del.) moving a vote of thanks, told the Mwalimu : &quot;You belong to a very special group of African leaders who stepped down from power.&quot; That group includes only Nyerere and Senegal's first President Leopold Senghor, who retired in 1980, Ahmad Ahijido of Cameroon, and Siaka Stevens of Sierre Leone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SUDAN DEMOCRATIC GAZETTE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the collapse of the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) mediated talks on 8 September, the four heads of state of the IGADD countries resolved on 19 September, at their summit in Nairobi, to stay on course and preserve with their efforts to find a lasting peaceful solution to Sudan's conflict.  In addition, they called upon the international community to support their efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four heads of state, Daniel arop Moi of Kenya, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Meles Zinawi of Ethiopia and Isias Afworki of Eritrea, held a one day summit in Nairobi, Kenya to reaffirm their commitment to peace, pointing out that they were not dispassionate observers to the Sudanese conflict but in fact concerned neighbors with a vested interest in bringing peace to that country.  They pointed out that the waste of innocent lives and the impediment to development, which the war has brought to Sudan, has also affected their four countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their joint statement, issued after a one day summit in Nairobi on 19 September said: &quot;The heads of state of the IGADD Committee on the Sudanese Conflict have today decided that the IGADD initiative should continue.  The talks had reached a deadlock on the vital issues of separation of state and religion and on the question of Self-determination for Southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The heads of state consider the Declaration of Principles (DOP) agreed during the talks to continue.  The heads of state will seek collective and appropriate means to re-inforce the on going IGADD initiative with a view to reaching a final settlement of the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the heads of state, speaking to the Gazette after the Nairobi summit, said that some of the Sudanese parties to the conflict were labouring under the misconception that the IGADD countries would eventually lose interest in the conflict and leave the Sudanese to continue fighting amongst themselves.  This is not the case.  He stated that he has watch the Sudanese kill each other for too long.  Originally the IGADD countries assumed that the Sudanese would be capable of resolving the conflict themselves.  When, forty years on, it became apparent that they were not, the IGADD leaders were left with few options but to act positively.  He hoped that the international community would give the IGADD peace effort the support it needs to succeed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Environmental groups have promised drastic action if Dawie de Villiers' proposal to allow the importation of toxic waste goes ahead, writes Eddie Koch TOXIC waste shipments will be allowed into the country, according to new policy devised by Environment Minister Dawie de Villiers.  The move overturns a current ban on toxic waste imports and would make South Africa one of only two African countries that trades in industrial poisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Environmental groups promise a nationwide campaign of civil disobedience if the proposal goes ahead and say they will mobilise support from the ANC and its allied organisations, who support a total ban on all toxic imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A White Paper gazetted this month says the existing embargo on toxic imports into the country is not in South Africa's interests and proposes o create regions in the country where toxic material from overseas countries can be dumped.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A blanket ban on transboundary movement of such wastes would ...  jeopardise and impact adversely on present economic and industrial activities,&quot; says the document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposal flies in the face of ANC policy that states: &quot;We will not allow our country to become a dumping ground for toxic waste.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The only reason that other countries would pay South Africa to take their toxic waste is because contractors here are allowed to cut corners that contractors in countries such as the United States and the Netherlands would be jailed for doing,&quot; says Chris Albertyn of Earthlife Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The first costs to be cut are those of protecting the health of workers and pollution of the environment ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every other government on the continent backs Organisation of African Unity resolutions which prohibit any form of toxic material being dumped here.  The OAU has also adopted the Bamako Convention which bans all imports of hazardous wastes into the content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A discussion document on foreign policy, released recently by the ANC, recommends that South Africa sign the convention. The move by De Villiers' department is thus likely to open rifts in the cabinet between the ANC and the National Party, which allowed toxic imports when it was in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Environmental groups reject the White Paper's claim that South Africa has the technical expertise to dispose of toxic materials in a safe way.  They say recent incidents at the Thor Chemicals plant in Natal demonstrate how incompetent local authorities are in handling these imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A director and two senior officials from Thor, a British-owned firm with a plant at Cato Ridge near Pietermaritzburg, are currently facing culpable homicide charges after two workers died after being exposed to high levels of mercury toxins. Another worker has been in a coma for three years due to the exposure and 28 others are diagnosed as having mercury poisoning symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thor was provided with a permit by the old government to import large amounts of toxic materials from the United States.  Rivers in the region have been also been polluted by large amounts of mercury leakages from the plant. The scandal led to the current ban being slapped on all shipments of waste into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earthlife Africa says it is mobilising its branches and allied organisations in the civic and trade union movements to resist the proposal.  &quot;There will be civil disobedience on a major scale if this passes into law,&quot; warns Albertyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The document stipulates that a strict set of minimum standards will be developed to minimise threats from transboundary movements of toxic waste and the storage of these materials. This has been supplemented by three volumes, produced by the Department of Water Affairs, which lay down detailed guidelines for managing waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials in the Environment Department defend the paper by noting it meets requirements of the Basel Convention, an international agreement designed to ensure effective controls on transboundary movements of toxic materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It endorses the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle which states that anyone guilty of damaging the environment by mishandling waste be forced to pay for reparations.  This concedes to a demand that has long been made by the environmental movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The document also supports the &quot;cradle to grave&quot; principle, which provides for control of the entire waste cycle from the point of production to the recycling, destruction or safe disposal of these materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Willem Scott, deputy director in charge of pollution control at the Department of Environment Affairs, told the Weekly Mail &amp; Guardian the proposed relaxation on toxic imports was intended &quot;only as a last resort under special circumstances&quot; and there was no plan for South Africa to become a major player in the trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said South Africa was not snubbing the rest of Africa by allowing limited imports as many countries on the continent were party to the Basel Convention which guides the principles of the White Paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Human rights lawyers and green activists are worried that the proposed legislation specifically excludes organised labour from taking part in the management of toxic imports and dumping.  The Thor case, they argue, shows that factory workers are frequently the first to suffer and play a vital watchdog role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the department, the proposal will not become law until it has been subjected to scrutiny.  &quot;The public will be given ample opportunity to comment before it is finalised,&quot; said Scott.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agents of the previous government's National Intelligence Service have been displaying an unusual interest in the RDP, report Drew Forrest and Wiseman Khuzwayo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Intelligence Service (NIS) has taken it upon itself to police the reconstruction and development programme -- provoking an angry response from President Nelson Mandela's office and the office of RDP Minister Jay Naidoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Weekly Mail &amp; Guardian knows of two cases where NIS agents have approached individuals, claiming to be acting on behalf of the RDP. In one case, the intelligence agency interviewed a senior official of the Pretoria branch of the South African National Civics Organisation (Sanco).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NIS comprises the intelligence agents of the previous, white-dominated government. It has yet to be integrated into the new, legitimate structures of the National Intelligence Community (NIC), which will include members of the ANC's department of intelligence and security (DIS).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Questioned this week about the NIS's role in respect of the RDP, its spokesman, Willem Theron, confirmed their interest in backing up the government policy: &quot;The NIS and a future intelligence agency's role is to provide the government with intelligence on any matter related to security and stability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The successful implementation of the RDP is seen as a key element of ensuring social and political stability, and as such the NIS is instrumental in providing the government of national unity with timely intelligence on any aspect threatening the government's programmes, including the RDP.&quot; He declined to give specifics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This has provoked an immediate response, with experts and politicians pointing out that it is the NIS's role to protect the security of the state, not to ensure the smooth-running of government policy; the NIS is charged with watching those who break the law, not those who oppose government policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Military consultant Jakkie Cilliers, director of the Institute for Defence Policy, expressed concern that actions taken in the name of the RDP may just be duplicating the &quot;total onslaught strategy&quot; of the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Justifying intelligence activities in this way follows the tradition of the previous national strategy. It can easily become an excuse to justify budgetary expenses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Approached for comment, Mandela's spokesman, Joel Netshitenzhe, said Mandela would request a report from the NIS. He added: &quot;It is the firm view of the president that the government is totally opposed to attempts by any agency to snoop on citizens who are not involved in unconstitutional or illegal activity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Fred Oberholzer, spokesman for Naidoo, strongly distanced the minister from any activities undertaken by NIS in defence of the RDP. &quot;We have never requested the NIS to collect any information on our behalf nor have we asked them to speak on our behalf,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pending legislation, the NIS has yet to be integrated into the new National Intelligence Community, which will take on more than 900 ANC intelligence agents. It and other intelligence services are unchanged since the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sanco's Pretoria secretary, Jackie Masemola, said that in June, two NIS agents -- Peter Small and a Myburgh -- had approached him, saying they were co-operating with Naidoo's office on the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masemola said the agents claimed they were interested in security matters in the townships as an aspect of RDP implementation, and wanted to have formal meetings with him. They also expressed a particular interest in the reaction of Sanco's constituency to the petrol price increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The request was discussed by Sanco's Pretoria executive on June 29.  The minutes of the meeting note the executive agreed that &quot;these meetings (between NIS and Masemola) should continue to ascertain their (the NIS) role in the RDP&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masemola said this was not a green light for him to establish formal contact with the NIS agents. Sanco had approached Naidoo's office to verify the NIS claim and was still awaiting a response. In addition, the general council of Sanco had discussed the matter and had recommended caution in dealing with the NIS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another incident, the housing co-ordinator of the non-governmental organisation Planact, lawyer Carien Engelbrecht, said she had been interviewed by an NIS agent after giving a speech early this month at a high- level housing conference which alluded to illegal immigrants living in the Johannesburg inner city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A member of the Planact management committee had been present at the interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Engelbrecht said a certain Greta Bezuidenhout, an NIS section head operating from an office in Braamfontein, had told her the intelligence agency &quot;was investigating issues which threatened the attainment of the RDP&quot;, including illegal immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bezuidenhout had asked for the source of Planact's statistics on immigrants and had offered to share information &quot;in the interests of the RDP&quot;. She had also implied that her information-gathering exercise had the backing of PWV Safety and Security minister Jesse Duarte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week Duarte vehemently denied this, saying she would follow up the issue with the NIS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The questions related to existing or potential clients,&quot; Engelbrecht said. &quot;It was very creepy and we didn't co-operate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has also been learnt that the secretary of Sanco's Northern Cape region has been suspended for, among other things, holding secret meetings with NIS agents on Sanco premises. The nature of these dealings could not be established.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2854 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi has survived many political crises in his time. Each time analysts have dared to predict the end of his political life, Buthelezi has bounced back with greater confidence and in the process has consolidated his own and his party's place in the national political equation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In many ways, he has demonstrated the same tenacity for which National Party politicians have become so well known for over the years, surviving crises that would destroy governments in almost any democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is almost certain to survive the most recent embarrassment he caused himself at the South African Broadcasting Corporation television studio Durban last Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But what the incident has brought to the fore is a genuine frustration generated by his failure to carve a niche for himself in national government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The depth of his frustrations was clearly illustrated by the bitterness of his response to a cabinet decision not to give him sole control over the local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I hope they exclude me for good. I am out of it. If they want to do it by themselves then they will do it by themselves then they will do it by themselves,&quot; Buthelezi was reported as saying the cabinet decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frustrations generated by Buthelezi's futile attempts at making an impact in the cabinet were only made worse by rifts between himself and the Zulu monarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi and his party have in the past benefited a great deal from their association with the monarchy and the souring of relations does not help Inkatha or its leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How the struggle will resolve itself and whether Zwelithini will muster the resolve to break with Buthelezi at the end of the battle remains difficult to speculate on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But analyst say the battle is not unique or new to Zulu politics. In fact, both Zwelithini and Buthelezi must feel a sense of deja vu, knowing that they have been through all of it before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In many ways, the monarchy was faced with a similar struggle from the late sixties to the late seventies when Buthelezi and his supporters tried to pull the king into their kraal while the National Party tried to secure overall control of the Royal House to advance its own homeland policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gerhart Mare of the University of Natal's sociology department says the struggle now playing itself out in the province is in some ways a replay of that tussle that went on in the sixties and seventies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Details of these clashes have been extensively recorded by historians, among them Mzala in his book on Inkatha and Buthelezi titled &quot;Gathsha Buthelezi - chief with a Double Agenda&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What soured relations between the King and Buthelezi then was the Inkatha leaders' insistence that the Monarch should restrict himself to a ceremonial role and stay aloof from party politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The King must personify the unity of the Zulu nation; the King must be kept out of the heat and dust of politics,&quot; Buthelezi was said to have argued then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Inkatha leaders' view prevailed then, much against Zwelithini's wishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the move to curtail tha King's powers did not gain favour in the Royal House became evident from the fact that Buthelezi was excluded from preparations for Zwelithini's coronation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi was also prevented from performing the role of master of ceremonies, which would have greatly enhanced the Inkatha leaders' standing in the Zulu kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, the royal family appointed Prince Herbert Zulu in Buthelezi's place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That fight was important because it was thought by both sides that they could gain legitamacy from a relationship with the king that would benefit them,&quot; Mare says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was therefore not surprising when Zwelithini was made patron of two political parties, the Inala and Icilongo parties, which had been floated by the NP to thwart Buthelezi's opposition to apartheid's brand of independence for homelands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi, however, won that battle and defeated the NP's attempt to foist independence on kwaZulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zwelithini, at the stage, was evidently willing to accept independence to advance his own vision of establishing an executive monarchy and even went to Swaziland to study that country's constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mare says current events are similar to those witnessed in the sixties and seventies in that there has been mention of a royal political party and some people involved with the king then have once come to the fore, including Prince Israel Mcwayizeni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The similarities go furhter in that Inkatha continues as an opposition movement in the sense that it remains a minority party in national politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One area in which it is not easy to draw similarities is around the question of who would be steering the king's battle against Buthelezi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the seventies, it was evidently the NP's Bureau for State Security.  But much has changed politically and it is unlikely that remnants of the NP's intelligence network could be the driving influence this time around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zwelithini himself has never demonstrated the capacity to independantly orchestrate any political manoeuvre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many have suggested that the ANC might have precipitated the rift. But even that remains unclear given the fact that not all in the Royal House are ANC supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mare says one factor that might be at play is the emergence of a new set of power players, made possible by changed political conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says that the current conflict would not have happened had Buthelezi continuted to hold the office of chief minister of kwaZulu and the ANC remained a banned organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think there is some kind of shift within the Royal House and the confidence gained from that, which has a political link, has allowed the emergence of a different set of power players,&quot; Mare exlains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it is this confidence which has found expression in the form of the challenge posed to Buthelezi as a traditional prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He emphasises that while some of the new power players have ANC leanings, not all would fall into the same political camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mare also rules out the possibility of Zwelithini emerging as a rival political force in the province that could challenge Inkatha for power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He (Zwelithini) had the crude and clear failure of patronising political parties that failed in the seventies and this would give Buthelezi great confidence that Zwelithini will not emerge as an independent political force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A third political force led by the King would also find itself caught between two other political forces-the ANC and Inkatha-and will not survive in such a situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, says Mare, the struggle is for control of the entire Royal package which comes with the King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He goes on to explain that it is clear the King has been central to the legitamacy Buthelezi has gained up to now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And around the royal tradition of the Zulu people, there is a package of institutions such as the chiefs, who have been tremendously important in Inkatha's mobilisation before and during the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore Buthelezi will continue to fight for control over the entire institution of royalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Therefore, Buthelezi and those around him have been saying that it is not the king as a person that is important, but rather the monarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And the battle for control over that package of tradition, in which the monarchy is very important will continue for some time still, particularly for the access it offers to support on the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inkatha is, however, projecting the struggle very differently, with Buthelezi focusing his attack on Zwelithini's apparent desire for an executive monarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At last weekend's King Shaka celebration, Buthelezi warned Zwelithini to stay out of politics, saying there was no room in the new South Africa for an executive monarch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi clearly recognized Zwelithini's past willingness to accept the National Party offer in the late seventies for an independent kwaZulu ruled by an executive king.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inkatha secretary-general Ziba Jiyane also pointed to the possibility that attempts may be made to promote the case for an executive monarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The IFP fought hard for the creation of the constitutional monarchy, but there are those who have influence over the king who want the creation of an executive monarchy, such as exists in Swaziland,&quot; he told New Nation last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other analysts share the view that if those surrounding Zwelithini succeed in serving with Inkatha, they will begin mobilising grassroots support but they do not go so far as to suggest that the king will challenge Buthelezi for power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, they do not rule out the possibility of conservative Afrikaners and remnant structures of the old apartheid state, who pin their hopes on a failure of the government of national unity, coming to the aid of the monarchy with the hope of advancing dated agendas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These analysts also point to instances before the April elections when Zwelithini alluded to the possibility of establishing a soverign state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This was the first time that the king had publicaly defined his position outside of that had been defined for him by Buthelezi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This was a sign of a growing definition of his own boundries of power,&quot; one analyst says, adding that was very unnerving for Buthelezi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, there are doubts as to the extent to which the Royal House will be able to mobilise support purely on a traditional ticket and loyalty to the king.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These attempts will be undermined by the fact that the monarch will not be able to deliver material benefits to his loyalists and this will effect the extent to which Zwelthini will succeed in building an independent base,&quot; one analyst says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the exact detail of the king's agenda will only begin to emerge more clearly once the struggle with Buthalezi reaches some finality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Question is- how will this struggle resolve itself and what impact will it have on Inkatha support in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zwelthini has not demonstrated strong leadership in the past and has remained quiet for most of the current conflict between himself and Buthelezi. And this makes it difficult to assess the possibility of the king severing ties with Inkatha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If, however the new power players succed in their push for a clinical break with Buthalezi, the impact it could have on Inkatha will be informed by the extent to which the IFP is dependent on the monarchy for grassroots support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mare says if Buthelezi and Inkatha lose control over the entire package that goes with the tradition of royalty, it could have an impact on the IFP which depends very much on its regional and traditional support base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he adds that is not clear at all whether the ANC would be able to step into the space created by such a development- it would however, change the balance of forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A neutral king will certainly benefit the ANC,&quot; says Mare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also does not rule out the possibility of some people in the IFP leaving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's Blade Nzimande, currently a member of palimrnt, also seems to suggest that a break with the Royal House will precipitate divisions within Inkatha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People pledging their loyalty to the king are not going to take kindly to attempts by Inkatha to substitute itself for the King,&quot; says Nzimande.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;New kinds of tensions are going to emerge that will threaten the IFP,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He points out that it was significant that the Natal amakhosi have been quiet about the tensions. &quot;This indicates that tensions in the IFP along traditional lines are already surfacing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jiyane disagrees, saying that a split between the IFP and the king will have no effect on Inkatha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to &quot;NewNation&quot; last week, Jiyane said the IFP had built the monarchy into what it was and not the other way around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The IFP revived and built the kingdom to respectable standards and levels of prestige over the years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not everyone projects as optimistic a prognosis as Jiyane does. A political scientist &quot;NewNation&quot; spoke to says there is little beyond the monarchy the Inkatha can use to mobilise support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Inkatha as a political party is weakened by the absence of a resilient organisational structure - it has become more and more a party that simply reacts to various situations,&quot; the political analyst says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If it loses its traditional base, it may well suffer considerable damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One way or another, Inkatha is unlikely to forego the advantage of having the monarchy on its side, especially at this crucial stage in the preparations for local government elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi knows as well as anyone else the importance of retaining power at local government level, because that is the level at which delivery of tangible change envisaged by the Reconstruction and Development Programme will take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the visibility of political parties at local government level will have a crucial bearing on the outcome of the next national election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The constant struggle to meet college tuition and book fees will continue for Bakary Camara in Dakar if the decision is taken to declare this academic year invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bakary, 24, is a final year student of English and philosophy at the Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar.  In an interview with the &quot;Daily Observer,&quot; he said it has always been difficult for him to secure funding for his education.  &quot;I would have loved to say 'Thank God' at the end of this year, but with the current problems, the future is uncertain and I face a continuing struggle to earn a mere bachelor's degree,&quot; he complained.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bakary, who entered the university in 1990, has survived on petty trading at the end of each academic year.  Buying inferior goods in Dakar and selling them in villages in Casamance, he used the meagre profits to meet college expenses.  If this academic year is declared void, he will have to spend another two years raising more funds.  &quot;All my plans will have been destroyed,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, according to sources, the university authorities have set a deadline as to whether this year will be declared invalid or whether another solution can be found.  The sources also intimated that lecturers are divided in support for the propose &quot;white year&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The secretary-general of the United Democratic Union of Senegalese Teachers, Iba Ndiaye Djadji, supported the need for the 1993/94 academic year to be invalidated by pointing out certain instances which compromise its validity.  He commented that the university must be a place of competence and excellence in the service of development.  He called for a dialogue to prepare a new academic year for the success and development of the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Baboucarr Diop, secretary general of Le Federaton de l'Education et de la Recherche, said all mediation efforts have failed and therefore the same problems of the university persist.  He maintained that it is necessary to find a solution and called on all to sacrifice in order to save the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to &quot;Le Soleil,&quot; a leading Senegalese newspaper, the university principal, Sulaymane Niang, has said the assembly endorses the non-validation of the academic year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An estimated half-million Rwandans have died, cruelly, in the space of a few months.  Was this appalling catastrophe avoidable?  In &quot;Africa Demos&quot; of February 1992, we published a letter from Rwanda's Ambassador to the United States, the Hon.  Aloys Uwimana, in which he explained the steps being taken by the government of President Juvenal Habyarimana to establish &quot;the rules guaranteeing a more profound respect of the workings of democracy and ensuring national cohesion.&quot; A Commission to that effect, he told us, was established on Sept. 21,1990, just nine days before the invasion launched from Uganda by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the following issue of August 1992, we published an extensive rejoinder by Nicola Jefferson to the Ambassador's letter titled, &quot;Behind the Democratic Veil in Rwanda.&quot; In her article, she gave a detailed account of the tyrannical and tribalist system established by Habyarimana: grenade attacks without warning; killings, arson and vandalism 'far from the combat zone;&quot; official encouragement and participation in &quot;vicious attacks against members of the Tutsi minority group;&quot; radio broadcasts of scurrilous accusations against government opponents; &quot;beatings and disappearances&quot; of Tutsi civilians taken into government custody, including thousands detained after the September 1990 invasion; and the persecution of &quot;outspoken journalists&quot; and the seizure of opposition publications.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Everything that has happened since Habyarimana was apparently killed by his regime's hardliners in the downing of his aircraft on April 6 is an expansion of a policy of systematic repression already documented by Human Rights Watch/ Africa.  The French government, which created a &quot;safe zone&quot; in the southwest of Rwanda when the United Nations failed to act, was deeply complicit in Habyarimana's tyranny, providing training, equipment and advisers for his armed forces.  Yet, that is little different from what France has done, and continues to do, throughout Francophone Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although effective action was not taken to curb the human rights abuses and political repression in Rwanda before and after the RPF invaded in 1990, a fundamental question sill has to be answered: Why did the international community fail to act expeditiously to protect Rwandan civilians after April 6?  It should be remembered that most of the U.N.  troops in Rwanda were pulled out after the crisis began, and the few hundred remaining had very restricted terms of engagement.  While it may be argued that the brutalities in such a small country could formerly be overlooked internationally, this excuse would not hold for anything that transpired within days of death.  Rwanda quickly became a killing field in which most of the victims were civilians and most of the perpetrators government-sponsored thugs.  To obtain a satisfactory account of why so little was done to protect so many citizens known to be at risk, an independent international commission of distinguished jurists, scholars and retired diplomats should be appointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States government will spend perhaps a half-billion dollars on relief operations for Rwandan refugees and displaced persons before the end of 1994 for what Defense Secretary William Perry has described as &quot;the most logistically complex humanitarian relief operation in U.S. history.&quot; Large sums will also be expended by other countries.  It is with mixed feelings that many of us read reports of these intricate logistical operations, using airports in Western Europe and Eastern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the united Nations finally decided on June 17, after weeks of U.S. obstruction, to put together an African peacekeeping force 5,5000 for Rwanda, more weeks were spent haggling over how much the United Nations should pay the United States to lease armored personnel carriers.  It is as if an individual who asked to transport a person in cardiac arrest to a hospital first insists on negotiating a fee for use of his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The information supplied to all western governments and major international agencies by Rwanda experts about what was happening, and how an even greater catastrophe could be avoided, was also widely circulated to the media and the U.S. foreign policy community.  The necessity and feasibility of creating an international security zone in the southern half of Rwanda were clearly and convincingly argued.  Regrettably, these submissions failed to sway key policymakers.  The United Nations, of course, had only recently been cautioned by President Bill Clinton to learn how and when to say &quot;no&quot; to request for large-scale humanitarian intervention.  Moreover, the opposition of the U.S. Defense Department to such an engagement proved insuperable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In principle, issues of state terrorism and genocide should tran-scend the fluctuating agendas of particular nations.  Unfortunately, without the active involvement, and even sanction of the United States, major conflicts and catastrophes cannot be satisfactorily addressed in the world today.  To ensure that half-million Rwandans have not died in vain, we need new rules, institutions, and mechanisms to guarantee that the next major catastrophe will be contained in a timely manner.  An independent review of this tragedy should be promptly initiated, perhaps under the auspices of organizations such as the International Commission of Jurists and the International Peace Academy, and its report and recommendations made widely available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwanda is more than an African tragedy.  It has brought all of us to the threshold of our own humanity.  The American equivalent of Rwandan deaths is less than four months, as a proportion of the U.S. population, would be 15 million- and the numbers are still mounting.  One of the charges to the group of eminent persons would be to review the profound gap between the humanity and inhumanity displayed within and outside Rwanda and to help the world community identify how in the future it could say &quot;yes&quot; when &quot;no&quot;, in the words of U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-, would be nothing but &quot;a scandal&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been no official response to Nigeria's application for a permanant seat in the United Nations, Un, Security Council. The council is expected to use the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the UN to consider increasing the number of its permanant members from five to 10, as part of an attempt to chart a new course for the world body in the next 50 years. But it has not taken a position on the matter and if precedence is anything to go by, such a step could remain stymied by big power intrigues and the beaurcratic inertia of the UN process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ibrahim Gambari, Nigeria's permanant representative to the UN, told NEWSWATCH he was sure the matter would be put on the agenda next year. He considered Nigeria's chances to be bright. &quot;We are favoured despite what you hear from certain quarter,&quot; Gambari said, insisting that his optimism was not misplaced.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Femi Aribisala, a senior research fellow at the Nigeria Institute of International Affairs, NIIA, does not think Nigeria has a chance. He told Newswatch there would have been no problems had the country not become what he called &quot;a disgrace on the international level.&quot; He was referring to the bad publicity against the country following the annulment of the June 12 presidential election. Gambari is also disturbed by the develpoment. He sees it as the only obstacle to the bid for the seat and said he hoped the country would return to civil rule by October next year when the UN holds the all-important 50th anniversary session. &quot;If we can get that - democratically elected civilian government in place, and I have no cause to believe the contrary, then we are as good as having clinched the post,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gambari is banking on the extensive role Nigeria has played in UN peace keeping operations and its pre-eminent position in the continent to tilt the balance in its favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Baba Gana Kingibe, external affairs minister, presented the request for the seat in an address to the 49th session of the General Assembly on September 28, saying it was in line with current discussions on equitable representation and increase in the council's membership. He called for a &quot;fundamantal restructuring&quot; of the UN system, arguing that the present composition and decision-making process of the council did not adequately reflect the existing international situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first time Nigeria expressed interest in the seat was in 1991 when Ibrahim Bagangida, former president, addressed the 46th session of the General Assembly in his capacity as the chairman of the Organisation of African Unity, OAU. He said the limitation of the permanent membership to the present five had become both anachronistic and unrepresentative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ike Nwachukwa, a retired major-general and former foreign affairs minister, formally proposed Nigeria's application for the seat during his address to the 47th session of the General Assembly in October 1992. It was not taken seriously initially. Said the New York Times of the bid: &quot;Nigeria is a nation knee-deep in garbage gunning for a permanent seat in the UN.&quot; Nwachukwa had told the assembly that &quot;Nigeria as the most populous African nation with the largest economic potential and proven commitment to the cause of world peace and security possesses the qualification to fulfill Africa's aspirations in this regard.&quot; He also observed that the council represents only three of the world's five regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The criteria for membership listed by Kingibe in Nigeria's favour include population, capacity to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, track record in international peace-keeping and peace-making efforts, and equitable geographical representation. The permanent members meet these and other more complex criteria for big power status. Population is an advantage for Nigeria because it remains the biggest black nation in the world. One out of every five Africans is a Nigerian. But, as experts have observed, population has to be measured not just in terms of size, but also as a function of its skills, education, health and relatively youthfulness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The size of Nigeria's exploitable territory is also an advantage, meaning that its economic base is potentially unlikely to be displaced in the early stages of any hostilities. None of the current permanent members has this disability. All of them enjoy a high and stable gross national products per capita, high productivity industrial production, and high proportion of national income available for new investment. The implication, as has been noted, is that none of the current big powers can be subdued &quot;without a world war and without a whole combination of other power fighting against them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A standard which the current permanent members enjoy which Nigeria also meets is the wide scale and diversity of its interests in the international system. It has interests in the West African subregion, the Africa region and in the large growing black diaspora. A third critical variable which applies in favour of the current permanent members is the recognition or acceptance of their status in the world's pecking order by other members of the international system. Other states, on a regional or global basis, defer to the wishes of the permanent members as they pursue their own interests, and this is a recognition that without the cooperation of the big five, these other nations cannot realise their goals. This is what has given the big five their status and clout and remains the biggest test Nigeria must pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, the regional rivals for the seat are South Africa and Egypt, which urged last week that the creation of any additional security council seat should be donr on a regional rather on a country-to-country basis. Amre Moussa, the Egyptian foreign minister, suggested to the UN General Assembly that regions not currently represented on the council should be allocated two seats each. The disadvantaged regions are Africa, Asia ans Latin America.  Under Moussa's proposal, the rotational principle will be used to determine the choice of the states that will fill the allotted seats to each region at any given time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gambari said while Egypt might gain from the influence of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary general, Nigeria as a permanent SC member will demonstrate better prospects of ensuring &quot;a fair African representation&quot; on the council. Aribisala said that although Egypt is in Africa, it is essentially an Arab nation. Against an African country like Nigeria, it has a slim chance,&quot; he added. Both Gambari and Aribisala failed to rate South Africa's chances high. They said it is too young and lacks both regional and interanational diplomatic experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The more formidable challenge to Nigeria's bid will probably come from Germany and Japan. Both countries have been mentioned consistently as potential permanent members primarily because of their big power economic status. Aribsala said they are the current favourite. &quot;It will look funny comparing Nigeria with countries like Germany and Japan,&quot; he argued. &quot;These countries are both economically stable and moreover they are democratic countries. This is in sharp contrast with what is happening in Nigeria today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The major obstacle confronting their own bids is probably the lingering reservation of their having caused both the First and Second World Wars. It still raises questions about their future commitment to the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN, formed in 1945 as the World War II was about to end, is in truth as much an attempt to guarentee international peace and security, as it was in conception a mechanism aimed at containing German and Japanese militarism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A lot has changed since then, however, and both countries, forced to follow a pacifist course as a condition for their surrender to the Allied powers, are no longer seen as posing danger to world peace. The United States which, along with the Soviet Union, played the leading role in bringing about their defeat is today actively backing their bids for permanent seats. This is, however, said to be on condition that they would not enjoy veto power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Japanese are pulling out all the stops in pressing their bid. Last week, their emperor, Akihito, was in Paris where President Francois Mitterand endorsed the bid. Boutros Ghali was also invited over to Tokyo last month and said at the end of the visit that the Japanese bid was a good idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only country that has supported Nigeria so far is Israel. Moshe Gilboa, former Israeli ambassador to Nigeria, said it deserved the seat because of its contributions to UN peace-keeping efforts, adding that Israel supported Nigeria's candidature from the start. &quot;Israel believes that Nigeria is a genuine representative of the African continent which it represents by virtue of its size and contributions to the UN,&quot; Gilboa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> China, which has a soft spot for Third World causes, might have been suportive also, but Nigeria incurred its anger in 1993 when it surprisingly approved consular level diplomatic relations with Taiwan which Peking insists is part of communist China and not a separate country. It accused Nigeria of recognising &quot;two republics in one country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers think the present political crisis is capable of depriving Nigeria of British support for the bid. Britain is Nigeria's most reliable ally. That leaves Russia and France as the possible remaining permanent members of teh council which could act to save Nigeria from an embarrassing unanimous rejection by the big five. Unfortunately, France has little to gain from Nigeria's membership. It still sees Nigeria as the major threat to its long-standing interest in sustaining a regional hegemony in Africa, particularly in the West African sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aribisala is convinced Africa will be given a seat eventually. &quot;I cannot say exactly when but I know it is in the nearest future,&quot; he said.  This will depend, according to him, on African states pursuing the quest as a common objective. &quot;They are not always unified but when they are, they usually got their way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH September 26, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil producing states in Nigeria have submitted proposals designed to help the on-going Constitutional Conference arrive at an equitable and acceptable revenue allocation formula.  The proposals were contained in a memorandum: &quot;Revenue Allocation in Nigeria-An Equitable Approach,&quot; submitted on their behalf by the Southern Minorities Delegates Forum, SMDF.  In the memorandum, oil producing states want a return to the formula recognized by the 1963 constitution which struck a reasonable balance between the principle of derivation and distributable pool account, DPA, popularly known as federation account.  By implication, they want a return to the formula adopted between 1950 and 1966 which gave a 50:50 balance between derivation and DPA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That formula was abandoned in 1967 when crude oil became a major revenue earner for the country.  Accordingly, mining rents and royalties which hitherto were earned by states from where oil was produced went to the federation account.  Such a turn around in policy, oil producing states argue, was indefensible, viewed against the background that derivation principle was given reasonable weight when national politics was dominated by the three regional governments, with each wanting to maximise the benefits from the natural resources located in its geographical area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order, therefore, to arrive at an acceptable formula, the SMDF, has made six recommendations to the conference.  One of the recommendations is that the conference should do away with oppressive constitutional and statutory provisions used by successive federal governments to confiscate the oil mineral wealth of the oil producing states.  These include the Petroleum Act 1969, and Section 40(3) of the 1979 Constitution.  The two laws, the SMDF pointed out, confiscated minerals from the mineral-producing communities.  The other law is the land use decree 52 of 1993, backdated to 2975, which vests ownership of shoreline lands including those reclaimed by private capital, in the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SMDF also wants the conference to recognise that rent and royalties from mineral oil prospecting activities are land related, arguing that royalty is payment made to a land owner for the extraction of wealth from beneath his land.  For this reason, mineral producing states have intrinsic right to rents and royalties paid on all minerals extracted from their land.  The SMDG wondered why this right which was recognised in the 1963 was not extended to the 1979 constitution.  Apart from restoration of royalty and rent right, oil producing states want all laws relating to oil company-community relations to be up graded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only that.  They want the laws that apply to other minerals to also to oil minerals.  Said the memorandum: &quot;If the Oyo State government through the Igbeti Marble Industry could unilaterally exploit the mineral in its territory, so be it for oil producing states and oil.&quot; It said oil producing states don't understand why Borno State government is allowed to commission feasibility studies on the deposits of soda ash, mica, glass sands, limestone, phosphorous and gypsum on its territory when such right is denied them regarding oil.  The same, it argued applies in the case of limestone whereby states are allowed to exploit the mineral to run their cement industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forum also wants the federal government to grant equity participation to the states which have minerals.  It cited examples within and outside Nigeria to buttress its position.  The eastern region, the forum pointed out, had equity shares in the Port Harcourt refinery before the civil war.  In Malaysia, it said, the state where the gas industry is located has 10 percent equity in it.  &quot;The new constitution should provide for this in respect of oil producing states,&quot; the forum recommended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To help the conference, the SMDF has submitted two proposals which, if adopted, will allow states benefit more from minerals located in their territories.  One on the proposals known as the Igbeti Marble Industry formula provides for recognition of the autonomous nationalities as the owners of the resources in their territory.  Under that formula which is currently applicable in the industry, the state government, using experts, financiers, technocrats and other relevant personnel, develops the resources on behalf of the community, subject to strategic and conservatory regulations imposed by the federal government.  Thereafter, the state makes percentage allocations to the federal government, the host local government, the host community and the operating industry.  Argued the forum: &quot; This approach will force every state to look inwards and halt the overdependence on the resources of other states and the federal government for funds.  It should be applicable to all resources-- oil minerals, solid minerals and agricultural resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the alternative, the forum has recommended that the revenue should be shared using the principle of derivation as specified in the 1963 constitution.  Section 140 of that constitution, it explained, recognised oil as a mineral while sub-section 5 of the same section also recognised continental shelf of a region or state as a part of its territory.  It provided that whatever derived from the territory must be shared 50 percent on the basis of derivation and 50 percent on the DPA principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From whatever goes to the DPA allocation, it also recommended that 30 percent of the distributable quota should go to the federal government.  In addition to its share of the federation account, it said the federal government should have exclusive revenue items which include federal income taxes and dividends from federal parastatals and companies.  &quot;It should retain 50 percent of this revenue and return 50 percent to the DPA,&quot; the forum said, adding that 50 percent allocation to the DPA should be shared to the states on the basis of 60 percent on equality and 40 percent on population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The memorandum also specified functions for the Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission, OMPADEC, which it wants retained in the new arrangement.  Among such responsibilities are control of coastal and marine pollution, industrial pollution, erosion and flooding, land and fishery as well as forestry resources in accordance with accepted international conventions.  In addition, it wants OMPADEC to embark on long-term industrialisation plan for the oil-producing states to ensure a decent level of socio-economic life for generations of indigenes of the states even when the oil is extinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To ensure that OMPADEC is properly funded to carry out these responsibilities, it proposed an allocation of 15 percent to it format he 50 percent derivation fund.  It also suggested that OMPADEC should be centrally managed with equitable representation of the affected states in the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, the memorandum recommended a return to a true federal system which provides for a proper devolution of powers and responsibilities.  Accordingly, it said the federal government should limit itself to a strict list of regulatory and common services leaving the socio-economic welfare and services of citizens, that is, education, health, housing, agriculture, commerce and tourism among others, to state and local governments.  &quot;This must of necessity increase the financial provisions to the lower tiers of government, and in no way weakens the federal government,&quot; the forum pointed out.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2427 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearly 6.4 million people have registered for the election. This is 81% of the eligible population of 7.9 million as estimated by the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Registration opened on 1 June and was to close on 15 August. The deadline was first extended to 20 August, but Renamo argued for a further extension because brigades had started late in its areas because Renamo had failed to grant access. On 19 August registration brigades were told to stay in place and on 22 August a further registration period of 24 August - 2 September was announced. More than 850,000 people were registered during the extra periods, mainly returning refugees, demobilised soldiers, and members of the new army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SMOOTH REGISTRATION--AWEPA observers who visited Zambezi, Tete, Manica, Sofala, Inhambane and Maputo provinces concluded that registration was smoothly and completely run everywhere they visited. The registration brigades took their jobs very seriously, worked well and, in general, knew and followed the rules. They seemed serious, well-trained, and committed to their work. AWEPA observers saw no example of improper or sloppy conduct by any registration worker.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Registration brigades were imaginative and resourceful in setting up their posts under difficult circumstances. Many simply worked under cashew trees. Some used school classrooms. In Inhaminga the brigade worked in a destroyed railway wagon. In Luala the brigade had been forced to borrow tables and chairs from local residents each day, returning them at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although some brigades were working in their home areas and members could go home at night, others were living in tents or specially constructed huts for three months. The brigades were remarkably good humoured about the difficult conditions, although we did see examples of brigades on strike in Caia and Quelimane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most registration posts AWEPA visited had completed their work and had few, if any, people arriving for registration by mid-August. In some instances brigades had finished their work in one or even two places and had been moved to other areas where people still had not been registered.  District electoral commissions seemed flexible and well organised in terms of moving brigades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Registration was largely completed and there was no need, in the areas visited, to extend registration beyond the initial 20 August deadline.  Everyone who wanted to register was able to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AWEPA observers saw and were told that it was common practice to set aside registration days for particular groups of people. Regulos or neighbourhood secretaries would then bring most of the people from their zone for registration on one or two days. This also facilitated identification, as the regulo or secretary could under the law provide testimony as to the identity of a person who had no identity document- varying from one-third to two-thirds of those being registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Numbered tickets (senhas) were used effectively for crowd control.  Where crowds were too large and people had to be sent home and told to come back the next day, the senhas allowed people to be taken in order when they returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although a few registration posts still had large queues in mid-August, there was a consensus that by moving brigades into the areas everyone would be registered by 20 August. The queues were due to late registration in cities, underestimates of population in areas of dislocated people, and returning refugees in border ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concern was expressed about the difficulties of access in Muanza, Cheriingoma and Morrumbala districts, where brigades were being transported to some zones by helicopter. Remote zones of all three districts are Renamo-controlled. In Morrumbala, the (Renamo) vice-president of the district electoral commission assured AWEPA that all zones had already been reached by 20 August. In Inhaminga, the (Renamo) vice-president for Cheringoma said that only one pocket with perhaps 125 potential voters had been missed. In Muanza with a week to go they were still waiting to transport two brigades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WE ARE LIKE GOATS--&quot;We are like goats&quot; said a man waiting to register in Nicoadala, as he made a motion with his hands to show how they had been sent to the registration post like a heard of goats. Most people say they are registering because they have been told they must.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When asked about the process, men often used vague phrases, saying that there would be a chance to &quot;elect a president&quot; or &quot;choose our leaders&quot;; few women would admit to knowing anything about the process. This reluctance to discuss the election is in sharp contrast both to other countries such as Malawi and Angola, and to earlier times when Mozambicans were often happy to discuss political issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This reluctance to talk reflects both the lack of civic education, which means most people are unsure what is to happen, and a genuine reluctance to talk about it. There is substantial fear that the election cannot bring anything good, and might serve to end the time of peace as it had in Angola. No one showed any excitement about the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The continued disruptions and mutinies by demobilised and about-to-be-demobalised soldiers (which also delayed AWEPA observer teams) has increased the worry and demoralisation of many ordinary people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Civic education has been particularly weak. Before the election, there was virtually no government or elecetion commission civic education, except for that done by non-government organisations. AWEPA, for example, trained teams from the youth, women's and trade union organisations (OJM, OMM, OTM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each registration brigade had a civic education worker who gave short explanations to people who came to register. Some also went to villages and neighbourhoods to hold meetings to tell people they had to register, although civic education workers repeatedly stressed they could have done more if they had had bicycles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although campaingning is legal in the period before the official campaign (which only grants additional rights, for example to radio air time), ther is little evidence of any political activity in most parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two types of intimidation have been noted by registration observation brigades. It is widely reported that Renamo has told peasants in its zones that the ballot would not be secret because curandeiros (traditional healers) will know how people vote and they must vote for Renamo. In Quelimane it is reported that Frelimo has put strong pressure on government employees to join the governing party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And there is no free campaigning in some Renamo zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 12 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES--The number of presidential and parlimentary candidates submitted to the National Election Commission (CNE) exceede all expectations; 13 presidential candidates and 13 political groups presented documents. There is one new coalition, the Patriotic Alliance (AP - Alianca Patriotica), which combines MONAMO and FAP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each candidate must submit a series of documents including notarised copies of identity and voter registration cards proof of a clean criminal record, and a letter agreeing to stand. This is set out in the electoral law, but many parties did not notice this and complained that it was onerous to do this in a short time. Each presidential candidate also had to submit 10,000 signatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The start of formal campaigning wsa delayed from 12 September until 22 September as a result of the extension of the registration period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twelve men are fighting for the presidency of Mozambique. They are, for the two large parties: Joaquim Chissano, Frelimo; Afonso Dhlakama, Renamo.  For both coalitions: Maximo Dias, AP; Wehia Riupa, UD.  For five small parties: Domingos Arouca, FUMO; Ya-Qub Simbindy, PIMO; Carlos Reis, UNAMO; Casimiro Nhamithambo, SOL; Padimbe Kamati, PPPM; Vasco Campira Mamboya, Pacode; and two independents:Carlos Jeque; Mario Machel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The election commission rejected the candidacy of Neves Serrano of PPLM because he did not submit the proper documentation. His party was also the only one not to submit any parlimentary candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 13 PARTIES PROPOSE CANDIDATES--Candidates were submitted by 11 parties and both coalitions. By mid-September the election commission had not yet ruled on their eligibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One coalition, the Alianca Patriotica, and six parties - Frelimo, Fumo, Pacode, PCN, PPPM and Renamo - handed in lists of candidates for all 11 electoral circles (provinces plus the city of Maputo), but with different numbers of candidates for each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The greatest number of nationally and international recognised names appeared, not surprisingly, on Frelimo's list for each circle was headed by well-known and long time party stalwarts such as Foreign Minister Pascoal Mocumbi (Inhambane), Defense Minister Alberto Chipande (Cabo Delgado), Minister without portfolio Mariano Matsinhe (Tete), Labour Minister Teodato Hunguana (Maputo City) and Transport Minister and chief peace negatiator Armando Guebuza (Maputo Province).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reappearance in first place of all the familiar names, however, disappointed many party members from the provinces, who claimed that they had proposed new blood at provincial level, only to see their own candidates seconded in favour of central party leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the top Frelimo names on provincial lists are people long based in Maputo. Meanwhile, some Frelimo members were surprised to see the prominence of names like Bonifacio Gruveta, Frelimo Party Secretary in Zambezi province after a reportedly poor performance. Recent opinion polls testify to teh growing popularity of Renamo in Zambezia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Sofala, Frelimo fielded Central Committee member Alcidio Nguenha, who springs from one of Sofala's elite families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Frelimo lists contained the names of several prominent media workers such as national radio director Manuel Tome (heading the list for Mancia), national TV director Botelho Moniz standing in Zambezia and radio delegate Antonio Barros also in Zambezia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It added some novelties which surprised the business and muslim communities, including businessman and owner of the nation's one private TV station, Carlos Klint (for Zambezi) and Nazir Lunat, son of Muslim business magnate Yacob Lunat, standing in Inhambane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Renamo's parlimentary efforts are concentrated in the centre and north. Renamo strongman and chief peace process negotiator Raul Domingos heads the list for Sofala province, where he was also sent to direct the central region election campaign. Second on the list is Renamo political delegate for the province, Manuel Pereira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Renamo's list in Zambezia is topped by David Alone, well-known sociologist, Frelimo dissident and son of a local regulo (traditional leader). Renamo Secretary General Vicente Ululu, a Maknode from Cabo Delgado, headsd the list for that province. Leading Renamo general, Herminio Morais, fronts the Maputo City candidates. In Niassa Renamo proposed only three candidates for the 11 potential seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Alianca Patriotica also appears to have concentrated considerable efforts in Zambezia Province, where the list is headed by Monamo President and AP presidential candidate, Maximo Dias, and includes other Monamo and FAP party top leaders Guilhermino Fortes (Monamo), Jose Palaco (FAP President) and Joao Ironga (FAP). FAP Secretary General Raul da Conceicao heads the list for Maputo City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PCN's Maputo City list is headed by Lutero Simango, PCN's top dog and son of the famous Frelimo dissent Urias Simango, followed by jurist Alice Mabota. Of PCN top leaders, Inacio Chire heads the list for Zambezia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FUMO has concentrated its top candidates in the southern provinces.  PIMO has meanwhile made its major efforts in the north, while virtually missing out the centre (no candidates in Manica and only four for Sofala).  PIMO president and presidential candidate Ya-Qub Sibindy heads the Nampula list.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The economic community of west African States, ECOWAS, is dying.  At the 17th session of the conference of heads of states and governments held in Abuja, August 4 to August 7, only seven leaders were present while others sent representatives.  Although most of the delegations arrived very late, their members had to rely on the generosity of Nigeria, the host country, for transport and accommodation arrangements.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result of the poor financial status of the community most of the materials meant for the summit could not be transported to the venue of the meeting on time.  Speeches of key officials were not distributed immediately after presentation, so journalist covering the summit had to rely on their notes and recordings.  The $27 million secretariat in Abuja is lacking in facilities.  There are no photocopying machines, no computers and no typewriters in the complex.  Speeches of Sani Abacha, a general and host, were only made available August 7, after most of the foreign journalists had gone back.  The problem brought Adama Gaye, the community's director of information, into serious confrontation with journalists. &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt that the information section has been operating without any budgetary allocation.  In an interview with &quot;Newswatch,&quot; Gaye lamented the culture of hoarding information by the policy makers of the community.  Said he: &quot;If the negative trend is not corrected, there is no need to hae an information department or to associate journalists with the activities of the community.  ECOWAS needs to go through glasnost (openness) and perestroika (reforms) if it is to realise its goals of becoming a people-oriented organisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problems, however, is that the community has no money to run it's affairs.  Last year's budget existed largely on paper due to non-payment of contributions by member states.  Its implementation stated only last July ending after Cape Verde, one of the member-countries, which raised objection, dropped it at the minister's summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides, most member-states have not met financial obligations to the organisation.  Only the Republic of Benin has fully paid up its contributions to the end of July this year.  Observers say this may be due to the fact that Nicephore Dieudonne Soglo, the country's leader, was the chairman of the community for the past two years.  Liberia is owing over $6 million in contributions alone.  It is followed by Cote d'Ivoire which owes $2.5 million.  Ghana, Mauritania, and Sierre Leone are owing more than $2 million each also.  Senegal, Gambia, Mali and Nigeria are in the $1 million bracket while others owe less than a million dollars each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A source at the secretariat put the arrears of debts owed by member states at $37 million.  &quot;With such huge debts,&quot; said the source, ' the idea of a serious community with laudable programmes is not possible.  We simply cannot continue to run like this.&quot; All outstanding contributions are to be paid within sixty months while capital funds still being awaited are to be remitted within thirty-six months.  The community, however, lacks the clout to enforce compliance with its resolutions.  One observer said that he was skeptical about the ability of the resolution to get the association out of the woods.  Said he: &quot;They have made more beautiful speeches a and resolutions than this or other summits, but once they are out of here, that is the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Newswatch&quot; also gathered that Nigeria has been bending over backwards to make the organisation which it helped to found in 1975 to remain afloat.  Under normal circumstances, the Republic of Benin which headed the community for the last two years ought to have hosted the summit.  But it approached Nigeria to save it that expenditure.  Nigeria is also to underwrite the hotel bills of most of the visitors lodged at the prestigious Nico-Noga-Hilton Hotel, Abuja, which is one of the most expensive in the country.  Expenses for most lodgers were pegged by the Nigerian government to avoid unnecessary high bills.  Apart from, this, Nigeria provided the aircraft that brought most heads of states to Abuja and also took them back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite its efforts to keep the community afloat, most of the Francophone countries kept away the summit.  &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt that they kept away in order to prevent a heated debate over the formation of parallel monetary union among themselves.  In January this year, six Francophone countries founded the West African Monetary Union, UEMOA, following the devaluation of their currency, the CFA.  Most English-speaking countries especially Nigeria and Ghana were afraid that the formation of UMEOA would grossly reduce commitment to ECOWAS by the countries concerned.  To ensure their presence, Nigeria prevailed on ECOWAS secretariat to postpone the summit till August so as to enable Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, two principal countries, to be represented by their leaders.  The two leaders agreed to come but at the last minute sent representatives instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their absence put Soglo in a tight corner.  He tried to assuage hostile feelings by explaining that the monetary union was the last chance the affected countries had to survive following spiraling inflation, social disenchantment and disinvestment in Francophone countries at the time of the devaluation of the CFA.  He also explained that the affected countries pit ECOWAS first by stating their genuine commitment to the body in articles one and two of their memoranda of association.  With these explanations, he called for the understanding of his fellow heads of states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana's Jerry Rawlings did not completely agree with him.  He said Ghana and indeed, all countries within the sub-region, have been saddled with the burden of structural adjustment in the past decade.  If these countries can weather the storm without going under, there is no reason why the Francophone countries can't do the same.  He warned that, &quot;whatever manoeuvres&quot;, whatever mechanics are put in place to sustain UMEOA should not undermine the ultimate goal of a united states of West Africa.&quot; The matter was left unresolved.  A diplomat told Newswatch that &quot;the sincerity of the Francophone countries to ECOWAS would now be measured by their commitment to the unity of purpose and financial commitment to the community, especially now that the leadership has moved to the other side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the problems, the summit eventually took off, holding most of its deliberations in camera.  Newswatch gathered that when the issue of observer status for the West African Journalists Association, WAJA and the democratic research group, GERDES, was mentioned, most of the delegates called for caution.  It was believed that openness would not work for the good of the community &quot;at a time like this.&quot; Rawlings, in a speech after his election, told the audience that there was need for caution in associating with organisations which called themselves democratic unions.  He was applauded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The community at its closed door sessions discussed the issue of poverty now ravaging the sub-region.  Rawlings admitted that there was gloom and deterioration in living standards in the region saying the problems seemed insurmountable.  He called for interstate trade as a way of ameliorating the bastardised economy of member-states and for self-sufficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting also provided an opportunity to review the situation in Liberia.  Most of the ECOWAS countries are said to be owing huge arrears for the upkeep of their soldiers in the beleaguered nation.  With a fragile peace prevailing in the country, ECOWAS leaders are afraid that except they can find needs for disarmament, rehabilitation of soldiers and the creation of means of subsistence for them the uneasy peace would not last.  Soglo warned that &quot;every minute of waiting is an encumbrance on the peace process which is bound to jeopardise the lives of millions of Liberians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rawlings was more apprehensive.  Said he: &quot;If ECOMOG fails, anarchists would take over.&quot; Both leaders called for foreign assistance in order to keep peace.  Rawlings warned that except armed sanctions imposed on member-countries are observed and money made available, the warring factions would strike at the ECOMOG and UNOMIL troops and unleash terror on them when they are vulnerable.  They, however, agreed that all efforts towards peace would succeed only when the Liberian people have resolved to make it among themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the problems which ECOWAS has refused to tackle over the years is the incessant military intervention in the sub-region's politics.  Just when the summit was being awaited, a new military junta imposed itself in The Gambia.  Sana Sabally, a lieutenant and product of the Nigerian Defence Academy, NDA, is the vice-chairman of the Provincial Ruling Council of The Gambia.  In defence of their action, the 21-year-old leader said they seized power &quot;to save our country in a coup devoid of rancour and bloodshed.  We have a herculean task of restoring democracy in our country.&quot; Such explanation did not move foreign observers at the summit whose governments are refusing to grant aids to countries under military rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rawlings, who has gone through the metamorphosis of military to civilian president, blamed developed countries for not understanding the dynamics of the African polity.  He said that through their manoevures, the industrialised nations have stopped Africans from evolving anything truly indigenous to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of deliberating on military incursions into the political life of member-states, the summit decided to speak on the establishment of an ECOWAS parliament. The protocol for the establishment of the parliament has been given to member states.  The final communique urged member states who are yet to sign the paper to do so with dispatch to enable the parliament to take off.  Said Soglo: We can put our strength on democratic process by having a parliament.  &quot;But an observer wondered if soldiers would be sent to the parliament from states under military rule.  Others believed that the issue was not with establishment of a parliament but getting funds to run it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting also refused to be drawn into the political crisis in Nigeria.  The government made ECOWAS leaders believe all was well in Nigeria.  Most of the visiting leaders were driven through routes where they did not see the long queues for fuel in Abuja. Schools remained open for the duration of the summit and school children were made to line up the streets at the airport to welcome the visitors, all in an attempt to give them a sense of calm and stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting adjourned to be reconvened at the end of July 1995 in Accra, Ghana.  Rawlings, who was elected chairman told Abacha that he would not hesitate to call on him if he found that he lacked the financial muscle required to host the summit in Accra.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An outstanding new academic book is this year's winner of the Noma Award for Publishing in Africa. The jury chose Paul Tiyambe Zeleza's &quot;A Modern Economic History of Africa. Volume 1 : The Nineteenth Century&quot;, published in 1993 by the Dakar-based Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA), as the winner of the 1994 Noma Award, citing the book as &quot;an ambitious, skillfully written, and exhaustively research synthesis of African economic history in the 19th century.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jury citation goes on to say that &quot; the book is an exercise in historical reconstruction, and its strength and distinction lies above all in its bold and convincing challenge to hitherto accepted orthodoxies, terminologies, and interpretations, about the nature and development of African societies and economies. The book is an outstanding, pioneering work, destined to become highly influential, and providing such a wealth of information and detail as to elevate the study of African economic history to anew pedestal.&quot; The jury considered a further achievement of the book to be its &quot;successful, continent-wide approach&quot; and &quot;its thorough accessibility&quot;.  The very full documentary apparatus in the book, &quot;which also makes it an extremely useful work of reference&quot;, was similarly praised by the jury. The publisher, CODESRIA, was commended for &quot;having shown great enterprise in identifying and supporting their author and finding him the necessary resources.&quot; Over 140 titles, from 55 African publishers, in 17 countries were submitted for this year's competition. The five-member Noma Award jury, chaired by Professor Abiola Irele, met in Oxford on 10-11 September to select the 1994 winner, together with a number of titles which were singled out for 'Special Commendation' or 'Honourable Mention'. In selecting the Award-winning title each year, the jury proceeds with the help of independent opinion and assessments secured from subject specialists. The $5000 prize will be presented to Tiyambe Zeleza at a special ceremony to be held on 29 November, coinciding with the 5th National Book Festival organized by the Publishers Association of Tanzania. It is hoped that former President Mwalimu Julius Nyerere will be agreeable to make the presentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Gender Profile of Tanzania,&quot; published by the Tanzanian Gender Networking Programme in 1993, was awarded 'Special Commendation' by the Noma jury. Produced by people who have been active in the women's movement in Tanzania at national and grassroots level for many years, the book was the Programme's &quot;collective and affirmative effort taken towards women's empowerment in Tanzania&quot;, and its &quot;novel participatory and democratic approach&quot;, employing &quot;innovative methods of accessing information and social data gathering&quot;. The jury also singled out five further books for 'Honourable Mention'. They are (in alphabetical order by author): &quot;Die wit vlinder&quot; by Corlia Fourie (children's book in Afrikaans), illustrated by Alida Bothma, Cape Town: Tafelberg Publishers, 1993; &quot;Assaulting Childhood. Children's Experiences of Migrancy and Hostel Life in South Africa&quot; by Sean Jones, Johannesburg: Witwatersrand University Press, 1993; &quot;Children of the Sun.  Selected Writers and Themes in South Africans Children's Literature&quot; by Elwyn Jenkins, Johannesburg: Ravan Press, 1993. &quot;Religion, Politics and Power in Northern Nigeria&quot; by Matthew Hassan Kukah, Ibadan: Spectrum Books Ltd., 1993; &quot;Mamy Wata et le monstre&quot; (Children's picture-story book) written and illustrated by Veroniqe Tadjo, Abidjan: Nouvelles Editions Ivoirennes, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Established in 1979, the Noma Award is open to African writers and scholars whose work is published in Africa. It is given annually for an outstanding new book in any of these three categories: (1) scholarly or academic, (2) books for children, (3) literature and creative writing. The Award's founder is the late Shoichi Noma, formerly President of Kodansha Ltd., the Japanese publishing giant. Mr. Noma died in 1984 after a lifetime's devotion to making books more readily available in developing countries, to actively promoting reader ship in these countries, and to bridging the gap between North and South. His ideals are shared by his daughter, Mrs. Sawako Noma, the current President of Kodansha, who has continued to support the prize generously. The Noma Award for Publishing Africa is administered by the quarterly journal &quot;The African Book Publishing Record&quot; published in Oxford, England, and currently celebrating its 20th year of publication.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even though there is some good news out of Africa, the enduring images of the continent are grisly scenes of the dead, the dying and the desperate in Rwanda and the refugee camps in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps a dozen other countries, from Nigeria to Angola, precariously dance on the precipice.  The consequences of the failed post-colonial state are do destructive that radical solutions must now be contemplated to avert the wholesale destruction of groups of the African people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many (people in the West) incorrectly think that Africans are incapable of governing themselves.  But the current crisis of the modern African state has its roots in European and Arab expansion, slavery, the partition of Africa at the Berlin Conference in 1885, and their distortion of the continent's political map.  The trauma of that history is evident today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africans had to live within the new colonial boundaries in completely alien political systems with contrived citizenry.  The analogy of the colonial state as a jail is appropriate.  These territorial units could not inspire loyalty because they were unnatural and forced.  They dismally failed to forge new nationalistic identities.  Although Africans fiercely struggled against colonialism, the post-colonial states they inherited continues to suffer from similar deficiencies.  Its structures, demographic composition and boundaries are colonial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since citizens lack instinctual and nationalistic bond to the state, those who become rulers pillage it.  They resort to massive human rights violations to hold power and keep their fellow citizens down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the single party or the impenetrable state is cast as the guarantor of national unity and development.  Those who criticize are stigmatized as unpatriotic.  But soon this tourist organization masquerading as the state is attacked or spins out of control because of its own paranoia.  Inevitably, ethnic, social and economic cleavages burst open, pitting citizen against citizen.  The alien state lacking a popular base either crumbles, or prosecutes a genocidal war, as it has done in Rwanda, Liberia and Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is little hope for Africa unless it courageously addresses the nature of the post-colonial state and reconfigures the political landscape of the continent.  Setting aside the foolish and racist talk about recolonizing Africa to save it, responsible Africans must for now discard several principles of international law better suited for Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first of these fetishes is state sovereignty, a concept that allows ridiculous colonial entities, such as The Gambia, Burundi, Liberia, Malawi, Burkina Faso and Tunisia, to claim inviolability.  The second id the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states.  These pillars of the law of nations have allowed callous elite to swim in small ponds under the pretext of statehood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since these colonial creations are not viable, their permanence should be repudiated.  A continental organization should be formed to re-draw the map of Africa to construct viable states.  Perhaps the Organization of Africa Unity whose &quot;raison d'etre&quot; ended with the abolition of apartheid--could justify its continued existence by making a new map for Africa.  The criteria for the creation of new states should include historical factors especially the demographic contours of Africa's pre-colonial states and political formations, ethnic similarities and alliances based on cultural homogeneity and economic viability.  The new map of Africa should hold no more than 15 states as opposed to the 50 today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Based on these criteria, my map of Africa creates new countries by abolishing some and combining others.  The new Republic of Kusini (which means &quot;south&quot; in the Kiswahili language would take in South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Lesotho, Swaziland and Malawi--nations with shared historical, economic and ethnic interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new Egypt would combine Egypt and northern Sudan.  Nubia which would bring together Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mali--named for an ancient empire would swallow up Mali, Senegal, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somalia would be beefed up by Djibouti, the Ogaden province of Ethiopia and Kenya's northern province.  Both the Ogaden and the Kenyan province are inhabited by Somali ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Congo would combine ethnically similar people of Zaire, Congo, Burundi, Central African Republic and Rwanda.  While Ghana, another ancient kingdom, would consist of Ghana, Ivory Coast, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Sao Tome, Principe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benin--named for a sprawling ancient kingdom--would take in Chad, Burkina Faso and Niger.  Algeria and Angola remain the same, while Libya takes over Tunisia.  Morocco, Western Sahara and Mauritania become Sahara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new state of Kisiwana which means &quot;Island&quot; in Kiswahili brings together Madagascar, Mauritius and the Comoros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few Africans owe their allegiance to the emergent state, many identify with an ethnic group--a loyalty which pre-dates colonialism--or the pan-Africanist idea of Africa as home.  The colonial state and its successor have been so alienated from the people that the development of national consciousness was not possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newer larger and democratic entities created by Africans for Africans stand a better chance of instilling loyalty and stoking the inherent love for the motherland.  This may be the only formula that will reverse Africa's disfiguration and save it from extinction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An international legal agreement to curb the degradation of arid lands worldwide will be open for signature on 14-15 October in Paris.  The agreement--the United Nations Convention on Desertification--was concluded on 18 June, also in Paris, by over 100 Governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of Heads of State, including the presidents of Senegal and Cape Verde, and Ministers are expected to attend the two-day high-level meeting at the UNESCO Centre.  French President Francois Mitterand will open the session.  After each Government signs the agreement, it will announce plans to implement the accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many countries are expected to outline concrete steps they will take immediately to tackle urgent desertification problems, especially in Africa.  It is hoped that these interim measures will jump-start the Convention's implementation even though the accord is not expected to become legally binding for some two years.  I will enter into force 90 days after it has been ratified by legislatures in 50 countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The convention was called for at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Haneiro, Brazil, to address the critical problem of the degradation of fragile drylands, which threatens the livelihoods and food security of over 900 million people in some 100 countries.  Ambassador Bo Kjellen of Sweden, chairman of the negotiating committee, called the convention &quot;an important step forward toward improving life for people in the drylands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The convention establishes a framework for national, sub-regional and regional programs to counter the degradation of drylands, including semi-arid grasslands and well as deserts.  It calls for international action, including the mobilization of &quot;substantial financial resources,&quot; transfer of anti-desertification technologies from developed to developing countries, information exchange and research and training programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One innovative feature of the agreement is that is &quot;commits countries to a bottom-up approach that involves the local populace, national aithorities and the international community,&quot; according to Hama Arba Diallo, executive secretary of the negotiating committee.  While in the past, &quot;countries often have just set up shopping lists of what they want&quot; from donors, the new convention &quot;initiates integrated national programs drawn up and implemented in consultation with donors and local communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four annexes detail how the agreement will be implemented regionally, in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the northern Mediterranean, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The degradation of arid lands, a process known as desertification, affects some 25 per cent of the Earth's land area and seems to be occurring at an accelerated rate globally, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).  The causes include overgrazing, overcropping, poor irrigation practices and deforestation, combined with climate variations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation is especially serious in Africa, where 66% of the continent is desert or dryland, and 73% of the agricultural drylands are already degraded.  The Convention aims to prevent long-term consequences such as mass migration, loss of plant and animal species, climate change and the need for emergency aid to populations in crisis.  Most of the world's 800 million people without adequate food live in the drylands, according the to Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of financial arrangements dominated the final negotiations for the Convention, held 6-17 June in Paris--the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Convention on Desertification (INCD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although donor counties did not agree to legally binding commitments to new anti-desertification funding--as many developing countries, particularly in Africa, had hoped--Mr. Diallo expressed confidence that &quot;resources to assist implementation of the Convention will be forthcoming.&quot; Several donor countries indicated they would return to Paris for the signing of the Convention ready to announce their contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Developing countries suffering from desertification pushed during negotiations for donor commitments to &quot;new and additional financial resources,&quot; the wording agreed to under Agenda 21, the Earth Summit action program.  In the end, donor countries agreed to &quot;mobilize substantial financial resources&quot; to combat desertification, a phrase that left open the possibility of increased funding without making hard promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Governments are urged to pursue the possibility of financing anti-desertification action through the Global Environment Facility (GEF), in cases where curbing desertification can be linked with the GEF's four mandated funding areas: preventing climate change and loss of species, and protecting international waterways and the ozone layer.  In practice, however, GEF funding covers only &quot;agreed incremental costs, &quot; i.e. those parts of a project which provide global benefits, a requirement which could prove challenging for many proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The GEF is the interim financing channel for the other legal agreements signed at the Earth Summit, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Framework Convention on Climate Change.  African countries in particular have long contended that the Facility should also fund anti-desertification projects.  However, even the entire US $2 billion recently pledged to replenish the GEF is just a fraction of the amount needed to combat desertification worldwide.  UNEP estimates that between US $10 billion and $22.4 billion would be required annually for an effective 20-year global program.  This would include the cost of rehabilitating land already degraded as well as preventing further loss of fertility.  Currently less than $1 billion per year is being spent, although the annual loss in agricultural income because of desertification is estimated to be some $42 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To provide scientific information and advise to the Conference of Parties, a monitoring body composed of countries that have ratified the agreement, a subsidiary Committee on Science and Technology will be set up, composed of Government representatives with particular competence.  The Conference of Parties will also maintain a roster of independent experts to be nominated by the Parties, from which it may appoint ad hoc panels as needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Convention's &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach reflects a growing recognition of the importance of grassroots groups and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in fighting desertification, because they reach the people who work the land.  The Convention assigns NGOs a role in designing and implementing national programs and in overseeing national desertification funds.  &quot;Local communities will be consulted on what they believe is an appropriate course of action, especially in light of traditional knowledge and practices,&quot; Mr.  Diallo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bottom-up approach is also tied to efforts to improve effectiveness of funding.  &quot;Development cooperation has come to a critical point,&quot; said Ambassador Kjellen in an interview last June.  &quot;People are asking if large funding programs have lost their purpose.  If our Convention can some up with a bottom-up approach which integrates physical factors with social and economic issues, perhaps donor fatigue can be turned to enthusiasm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Regional Implementation Annex for Africa recounts the particular conditions of the continent, including the high proportion of drylands, frequent droughts, political instability and difficult socio-economic conditions such as widespread poverty and high debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unique among regional instruments, the African Annex elaborates upon the obligations and Parties in the general Convention.  African countries should aim to &quot;mobilize new and additional national financial resources&quot; to combat desertification and to strengthen reforms toward decentralization, more democratic ownership of land, and participation of local people.  In implementing the Convention, developed countries should give priority to African countries and &quot;continue to allocate significant resources and/or increase resources&quot; to assist them in combating desertification, as well as facilitating the transfer of appropriate technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concerning technical assistance, the African Annex refers to the need to ensure that less-costly local experts are given preference over foreign consultants, reflecting dissatisfaction with the high overhead costs of many technical projects and their failure to use and empower local expertise.  To improve coordination on desertification activities, the Annex calls for consultative processes to be set up at the national, sub-regional and regional levels--including donors, national Governments, NGOs and local populations--to negotiate partnership agreements and to improve monitoring and information exchange.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> November 10, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government of Sudan has taken extraordinary measures to prevent the world from learning the specifics of its abysmal human rights record.  According to &quot;In the Name of God:&quot; Repression Continues in Northern Sudan,&quot; released today by Human Rights Watch/ Africa, gross human rights violations continue in Sudan five years after a military coup ousted the elected civilian government and brought to power a military regime dominated by the National Islamic Front (NIF). Based on the human rights situation in both the north and the south, Human Rights Watch/Africa calls on the international community, through the United Nations and the European Union, to pressure Sudan for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the current regime completes its fifth year in power, all forms of political opposition remain banned both legally and through systematic terror. Sudan has been profoundly altered through extensive purges of the civil service and by dismantling any element of civil society that challenges its narrow vision of an Islamic state. The whole country is politically controlled by a tiny ideological elite.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sudanese government has imposed harsh punishments on dissidents and excluded or restricted independent observers, journalists, human rights monitors, and humanitarian organizations. Sudanese who attempt to speak out on human rights issues have been subjected to threats or arrest, even when seeking to meet with the UN. Human Rights Commission's Special Rapporteur on Sudan, Gaspar Biro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public dialogue in Sudan has been silenced, even for those who share a commitment to the implementation of shari'a law but disagree with the policies and practices of the present government. All political parties remain banned, and arrests and torture of their members continue unabated.  Detentions of others believed to be or to have been political activists are designed to terrorize and intimidate through mistreatment and torture while in detention, often in unacknowledged, unofficial centers called &quot;ghost houses.&quot; The report includes testimony of horrific torture practices over the last several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armed conflict in the south of the country has provided the backdrop for particularly appalling abuse. The conflict has spread north; the peoples of Nuba Mountains of southern Kordofan have been suffering the combined effects of the cruelties of the army, government-sponsored militias, and the insurgent Sudan People's Liberation Army which the government seeks to crush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the Name of God&quot; highlights excerpts from a diary kept by a resident of Kordofan from late 1992 to April 1993, chronicling the large-scale displacement of Nubans, their forcible relocation under intolerable conditions, the abduction of children, the forced recruitment of boys as young as thirteen into military service, the destruction of churches, the abuses against women in displaced persons' camps, and the manipulation of the food supply for Islamic proselytization purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Human Rights Watch/Africa documents the plight of displaced persons and squatters in urban areas of northern Sudan, including Nubians and southerners uprooted by the war. In 1992 hundreds of thousands of the displaced and squatters were summarily evicted from their homes in urban areas. Their property was destroyed under a purported urban renewal campaign which targeted the large non-Arab and non- Muslim population of the capital.  This campaign continued in 1993, and an estimated 160,000 more people were similarly displaced in Khartoum in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report also underlines the plight of displaced southern boys, many of whom have been detained in government dragnets and removed, without due process or notice to their families, to detention camps, with a view toward indoctrination and eventual incorporation into the government militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NIF military government has also enacted and implemented a series of laws which place women and non-Muslims in a legally inferior relationship to men and Muslims. The death penalty and other forms of cruel and inhuman punishment are now expressly mandated for the crime of apostasy, the repudiation by a Muslim of his faith in Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Human Rights Watch/Africa offers a series of detailed recommendations to improve the current situation in Sudan. Among them, Human Rights Watch/Africa:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -Calls upon the Sudanese government to halt torture, flogging, the use of shackles, the hudud punishment, and summary executions; cease imposing shari'a on non-Muslims; abolish the crime of apostasy and the death penalty; and establish equality in law of women and non-Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -Recommends that the United Nations Security Council institute an arms embargo on the warring parties in Sudan and authorize a full contingent of United Nations human rights monitors with access to all parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -Urges the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and other concerned governments and bodies to use their votes in international financial institutions to oppose Sudanese requests for loans or disbursements on the grounds of gross human rights abuses. Using individual testimonies gathered in the region, the forty-three page report highlights human rights abuses in northern Sudan to supplement the evidence of violations in the south detailed in &quot;Civilian Devastation: Abuses by All Parties to the War in Southern Sudan,&quot; published by Human Rights Watch/Africa in July 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> October 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women are handicapped because of the legal system which makes it very difficult for them to own or inherit land, to own or run businesses, to sign contracts, to buy &quot;unnecessary goods&quot; or to get credit. Most women can't even get passports for themselves or their children without the permission of their husbands (who may be away working in the mines, and inaccessible). If, despite their many handicaps, women do develop income generating businesses, husbands can take them over and claim the profits. Under both systems of law applied in Lesotho, married women are treated as minor children, without the right to sue or be sued. Under customary law a woman is never regarded as an adult. Under common law show can have more rights, but only when she is single or widowed. Married women are always children before the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the Lesotho constitution guarantees basic human rights to women, and equality before the law, this guarantee is taken away in Section 18! Both customary and common law still apply in relation to matters which affect women: adoption, marriage, divorce, burial and inheritance of property. Thus the constitution contradicts itself, and , in the end, leaves over 50% of the adult population with status of children!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women do not have control over their own reproduction. Almost 60% of women are married by the age of 19, and the first baby is usually born soon after. A 1993 study revealed that 82% of girls wanted only four children or less. But 51% of the boys wanted five or more, and it is still the men who control reproduction. Family planning services are available in Lesotho, but in many rural areas women don't even know they exist! Those who do use some form of birth control often do so surreptitiously because their husbands strongly disapprove. The older, natural method of contraception (not having intercourse during breast feeding, which usually lasted two years) is disappearing in part because the woman's in-laws, and not the woman herself, decide when she must begin weaning the child. Abortion is illegal, even for health reasons, or following rape. 282 per 100,000 women die in child birth (almost 3 out of every 1000).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet a woman is usually left out of the decision making process regarding her own fertility! She may find herself treated more like a little valued breeding animal than like a respected adult human being. Women are not adequately protected from male violence. Many husbands believe they are entitled, before the law, to subdue their wives and children by violent means. Alcoholism is a major problem among Basotho males, and probably contributes significantly to injuries from domestic violence against women and children. Significant female violence against males or children is much less common. Adequate studies of common phenomena like &quot;wife beating&quot; don't yet exist, although anecdotal evidence is overwhelming. However, at QE II Hospital in January 1993 40% of patients were treated for injuries from assaults, stab wounds, rapes, burns and gunshot wounds. Most of the injuries were caused by males attacking other males, but a third of those wounded (usually also by males) were women. There are few legal protections for women assaulted by their own husbands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women have considerable coping and organizing skills. Women have gathered into hundreds of little credit societies, where they pool their own meager funds to make credit available to each other. There are thousands of other little income generating organizations, through which women help each other set up brewing, catering or dressmaking enterprises. Women have organized many of the little private creches and schools springing up around the country. Many of the institutions for the disabled have been conceived and developed by women. Women's church organizations are powerful forces in Lesotho's communities. Women are active in most of the other NGOs and in many informal societies seeking to improve the lives of their families, their communities and their country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> October 17, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the man on the street said, we have seen big things since &quot;The Monitor&quot; Editor-in-Chief Wafula Oguttu was arrested by the government in a fit of madness on October 6; and released about 24 hours later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charges against him, that he defamed three ministers when &quot;The Monitor&quot; published in a July 19, 1994 story alleging that the minister's performance had been criticized by President Yoweri Museveni at a meeting at Rwakitura, were withdrawn. That is an ugly sign, because when a government lets you off on a charge that could cost you six months in jail, it is because they might want to get you in on one that keeps you behind bars for three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, one of the greatest revelations of Waf's arrest was his mother. She is a tough cookie. She arrived at Central-Police Station in the evening and declared; &quot;I am not leaving here without Filipo.&quot; Philip was Waf's name until he ate something funny which went to his head and he dropped it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After she had been persuaded that the policemen would not eat her son, towards midnight she broke off her vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Waf's release, I have learnt that to be doted on you need one of two things: either to be very powerful like President Yoweri Museveni; very rich like James Mulwana; or to be a journalist who has been jailed unjustly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At &quot;The Monitor&quot; since Waf's release, all the visitors' chairs are piled outside his office. On Sunday night I left the office at 10:15 p.m., and there was still a respectable queue of sympathizers and solidarity stampers waiting to have their say. I have counted two international television interviews, and a couple of diplomatic visits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a complicated process going on here. And it is the product of the peculiar politics of Uganda under NRM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When it came to power in 1986, the NRM suspended political party activities. They argued that the country needed a breathing period to heal wounds, and that fractious party politics would make that impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, they made one important concession. These parties would be free to publish newspapers to push their political line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mainstream newspapers then felt flattered by the special status the government had accorded the press. They accepted the suspension of political parties for the reasons given by the NRM, and gave the government a very good press for the first time in three years. Newspapers like the pro-DP &quot;Citizen&quot; kept up a vicious tirade against the NRM. It wasn't long before it went into oblivion. &quot;Citizen&quot; made two mistakes. First, it was hysterically critical of the NRM at a time when the Movement was very popular in the market the paper circulated in. Secondly, while it campaigned for the suspension of the party activities to end, it kept alive the DP's rivalry with UPC, thus suggesting that freedom should be available to all other parties except UPC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It stumbled into the hole most journalists and newspapers fell into when they supported the suspension of party activities. There could be no freedom for DP only; just as the press should not have been short-sighted to imagine that somehow a government could tolerate a free press, but not a free political activity. There were cautionary articles in the media on this subject, but they were largely ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this co-habitation could not go on peacefully forever. Because once there was no politics organized independent of the NRM, it was not going to be long before the press should have been to take on issues that should have been handled by opposition political parties. Soon the press was campaigning directly against human rights abuses in the north, instead of just reporting about them. It was agitating against unfairness in the distribution of public jobs an development projects-until the largely ineffective &quot;anti-sectarian&quot; law of 1988 was promptly passed to put an end to that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the pressure continued, and even for the government-owned newspaper &quot;New Vision&quot; to remain viable and credible, it had to reflect these concerns. At one point it was the leading outlet for the reporting official corruption, the miserable life of the people, and student and staff discontent at Makerere University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The longer the parties remained on the shelves, the more themes which should have been the subject of political campaigns found their way into the papers. It was inevitable therefore that the NRM would begin to see newspapers and free journalism as more of a political activity than a journalistic enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So while a free press was s necessary component of the NRM strategy of muzzling the parties, it had to be controlled before it grew out of control.  The result was the pattern of harassment of journalists, followed by a long break of freedom, then a return to harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if that was all, the journalists would live with it as part of their &quot;professional hazards&quot;. However, because the absence of organized free politics made newspapering look more like political agitation than conventional journalism, the government brought the language and the weapons from political struggle to its confrontation with the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This language was bizarre and intimidating. The NRM has been fighting political groups which cannot oppose it in parliament or open campaigns.  Therefore there has been no normal debate where opposing points of view contest for public acceptance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In that situation, the NRM can do no better than call the parties names; &quot;divisive,&quot; &quot;sectarian,&quot; &quot;authors of the bloodshed of the past,&quot; &quot;murderous UPC,&quot; &quot;reactionary DP&quot; etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parties reply in the same currency; &quot;militaristic NRM,&quot; &quot;sectarian,&quot; &quot;sellers of the country to foreign interests,&quot; &quot;corrupt regime.&quot; All this because there is not forum for open and honest disputation being cultivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus when a story which is critical of the government appears in the paper, the charges follow as it were part of the stale political battle. The paper will be accused of trying to &quot;discredit the NRM government,&quot; &quot;putting the cabinet into disrepute,&quot; &quot;opposed to the unity of Uganda,&quot; &quot;being used by UPC,&quot; &quot;fighting DP's battles.&quot; When a pre-NRM journalist criticizes the government, he or she is immediately labeled a &quot;kipinga mizi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore a wrong report in a newspaper is never treated as an error; not is any article which is critical of the government considered to have been written or published in good faith. It can only be one thing; the work of an enemy. And it cannot combated with words or presenting the facts which the government claims to be truth. The editor of the newspaper is treated like he was a fighter in a battle field-jailed. Or of not, denounced in official propaganda, at rallies or state- monopolized media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The life of journalists in this country will only improve if there is sufficient freedom to allow groups to raise the issues of government conduct, thus removing the direct burden from the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As long as these wider political freedoms are not there, these issues will continue to appear in the press. And the government will continue to treat independent journalism as hostile political opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Journalists will continue to be attacked by politicians at rallies instead of print, to be arbitrarily jailed, and to be heroes for the wrong reason. If you asked any journalist whether he wants to be famous for writing a great story or being jailed unfairly, he will tell you he wants to be famous for writing. I see no sign that the NRM will allow that to be.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EXCERPTS FROM AN INTERVIEW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> November 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Tell us about your life in the past month, what you've been through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A: We've had quite a difficult experience or series of difficult experiences, beginning first with a visit I received one Monday morning from the immigration director, summoning me to his office for some questioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That morning, on the front page, two MPs were challenging the military leader, Mr. Jammeh, on a particular issue. We had an editorial where, as usual, we were pressing for the military to come up with a credible timetable to democratic civilian rule. And on the back page, we had a story of a German diplomat visiting in Dakar who had said in an interview with our reporter that the military should defend, not rule. That was the particular thing that seemed to have angered the military establishment in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They kept me there for a whole day asking all kinds of questions. I had to write a statement and then I was taken to the Immigration Office where I also had to write a statement. And finally they released me at 5:30 in the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was accompanied back to my home by an Immigration agent as well as a Labor Officer. The mission was to find out all the foreigners I had working for me and what was their status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was followed by Immigration and Labor as well as Social Security and Customs people checking into all of my books. They were surprised to find that we had just done our audit and the audit had been conducted by a reputable accountant, Panel K. Foster, an international auditing firm that anyone who wants to cheat doesn't go to. And most of our records were in order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We had a few refugees working with us from Liberia and also from Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Some of these were professional people. Some of them were just casual workers but we thought we were making a contribution to society by employing these refugees. They are not allowed to work under immigration law, they told me, but they never showed us the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following that, the reporter who had written the story about the German diplomat was picked up by plain clothes men who did not properly identify themselves. He spent a whole day at the police station. They wanted him to name a police informer who had given him the story, and of course he refused to do it. After about 6:00 or 7:00 they released him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following Friday, we published a story, saying construction companies were laying off hundreds of people because there was no work, reflecting the malaise which had begun to set in following the coup.  Apparently, the government didn't like that, so I was summoned and they took me far into the countryside, to an unknown destination, near the Senegalese border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After two days. an official told me that they had instructions to take me back to my residence. The man told me, &quot;Mr. Best, from now on you have to be very careful what you publish in your newspaper.&quot; But he didn't explain.  It turned out that they had already signed my deportation order, but they rescinded it because of intense political and diplomatic pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two weeks later, on a Sunday morning, I found the same Immigration jeep at my gate. The Immigration man, with a sheepish look on his face, said to me, &quot; I came to take you with me, I want you to go with me back to your office to find out whether you have any foreigners there. &quot;I said, &quot;There are no foreigners there. The office doesn't open until 10:00,&quot; but he said he wanted to make sure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When we got in the jeep, he took me to the airport and turned me over to another officer. Fortunately for me, my sister-in-law, who works for the UN Developmental Program, had a UN jeep to take her and my wife with her to the airport, and the two of them were sitting in the car inside the airport area waiting to see what would happen to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I spied the jeep, waved to them and they threw kisses back. I had on only my T- shirt. But my wife, who knew what going to happen to me, brought my jacket with her. As we passed the jeep, she called out to the senior officer who was in front and said, &quot;Could I please be allowed to give him his jacket?&quot; and he said, &quot;Is there any money in it?&quot; He checked for money and there was no money in it. He took the jacket and handed it to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: And what transpired when you got to Monrovia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A: I was surprised. The deputy foreign minister was there to greet me with a whole contingent of the press as well as a group of family members and friends. It was a rousing reception. The following morning people welcomed me on the streets and said, &quot;We're glad you're back and now we think we can have &quot;The Observer&quot; again.&quot; The void &quot;The Observer&quot; left when we were forced to stop publishing on the 2nd July 1990 has never been filled, they told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: What has happened with &quot;The Observer&quot; in Gambia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A: The chaps we left behind are courageous and determined to keep the paper going. The paper comes out everyday and it's forthright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: I've heard that people weren't very encouraging when you went to Gambia to start the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A: When I got there they told us that Gambians were not ready for this. They said the country was 80% illiterate, so who'd read the paper, that 10-to-20 people read (each copy) in The Gambia, so who would buy it, and that the government talks about commitment to press freedom but they don't mean it. I said to them, &quot;Any freedom that you have and don't use, you never know if you really have it or not. You have to test it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: We've seen the growth of an independent press all over Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A: Yes, it is a growing phenomenon, thanks to the developing awareness of the African public to public issues and to the growth of the democracy movements. I think that what has been happening in southern Africa, particularly South Africa, in the past three years has made a tremendous impact, and the collapse of communism and the emergence of one superpower also encouraged the democratic movements throughout the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People are always interested in expressing themselves. In The Gambia, people were not used to it. But &quot;The Observer&quot; changed all that. Suddenly everything was being discussed in the papers. That won us many friends, but also powerful enemies. You have to be socially responsible. If something would hurt the society by publishing it more than it would help it, you have to take a second look at it. In that context, we tried to put into the paper those things that would elevate the society and not things that will bring it down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The press is a critical vehicle in the quest of greater democracy and human rights. Without it, tyrants have a field day. I think it's significant that you people have as your first amendment of your constitution the guarantee of freedom of the press. That is the saving grace of your democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: After what you've been through, why do you persist? Why are you even thinking of re-starting your paper in Liberia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A: I come from a journalism family. My uncle, who went to jail two or three times, started writing in his 20s, and until he died in 1986, he was still struggling to save Liberia. Our continent is in a grievous and pervasive crisis. Many people, including many Africans, have given up on Africa. But we are aware that other parts of the world went through crises, tragedy and destruction. Europe. Your own country. You had a civil war, but that wasn't the end of the world, thank God. Im an eternal optimist and I always strive towards a better future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> October 31, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The managing director of the &quot;Observer&quot; newspaper, Kenneth Y. Best, was yesterday afternoon deported to Monrovia, Liberia, by the Gambian Immigration authorities.  This newspaper is yet to be told why Mr. Best has been deported, but according to Radio Gambia, quoting a press release from the Immigration Department, Mr. Best was deported because of some taxes he (or his company) owes to the Government, among other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Radio Gambia announcement also claimed that the company had been reported for employing foreigners who do not either have residential or work permits or both. And as a result of this, Mr. Best was deported having been considered &quot;an undesirable alien&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Retrospective -- However, it is important to state that some two months ago, Mr. Best was summoned by the Minister of Interior, Lt. Sadibou Hyadura, in connection with an article carried in the US-based &quot;Independent&quot; newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This writer, who was acting editor at the time, accompanied Mr. Best to the Minister to listened to what he had to say. And immediately we entered the office, this is that the Minister remarked among other things, &quot;Mr. Best, we have got a security problem with you and, in fact, we were going to ask you to park off and leave the country, but we thought we should call you to hear your side of the story before we could take any action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Minister then showed Mr. Best the article which quoted him as having said, among other things, that the military in Africa do not have a track record of fulfilling their promises. &quot;They make grandiose promises when they come to power but nothing is achieved,&quot; the &quot;Independent&quot; quoted Mr.  Best as having said. The controversial &quot;they&quot;, Mr. Best insisted, did not refer to the AFPRC per se.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it appeared that Council felt that it referred to them. In explaining his side of the story, Mr. Best told Lt. Hyadura that it was a general comment he made and that he was not referring to any particular military government. Mr. Best also told Lt. Hyadura that the American journalist who came to interview him had touched on a lot of issues. &quot;In as much as I made some negative comments about the nature of the military in Africa, I also said some positive things about the AFPRC, but unfortunately the journalist did not use them,&quot; Mr. Best explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, Mr. Best added, that it was no surprise to him because he should have known better than Western journalists since, in most cases, only look out for the negative things; they are not normally interested in the positive side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In conclusion, Mr. Best told the Minister to tell Chairman Jammeh and Council that he had said a lot of good things about the AFPRC in the interview, which never appeared. He regretted the incident and took the opportunity to inform Lt. Hyadura that he had started writing a 250-page book on the coup. &quot;We have gone far with the writing of the book and I can assure you that the book will take into account all the good things you have done,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Best told the Minister. Lt. Hyadura then said he was going to convey Mr. Best's reaction to Chairman Jammeh after which a decision would be taken. Many events unfolded since that summons- arrests, detentions, visitations by Customs Officials, Immigration, Social Security and Labour officers to the &quot;Observer&quot; office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also received many calls from the authorities expressing reservations about certain stories this newspaper had carried, including a complaint about why the Chairman Jammeh's Set Setal activity in Brikama was not carried on the front page but rather on page three, at a time when we had the Chairman's picture and story on the front page as the lead story, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deportation of Mr. Best -- The last blow to this newspaper came yesterday when Mr. Best was arrested by Immigration officers, at the gate of his residence in Kanifing at around 8:30am as he had just returned from the offices of the &quot;Daily Observer&quot; in Bakau. He had come to the &quot;Observer&quot; building to open the door and was on the verge of going to church when he met with officers at his residence's gate. There how was picked up and driven to the Banjul International Airport where he was made to board on ADC carrier bound for Monrovia. He had waited for few hours at the airport before finally boarding the aircraft at a little after 2 pm. His wife, Mao Gen. Best, shocked but courageous, drove up to the Airport to give Mr. Best a jacket to put on since he had on just a casual shirt. The jacket was reportedly rejected, but was accepted after Mr. Best a jacket to put on since he had on just a casual shirt. The jacket was reportedly rejected, but was accepted after Mrs. Best had pleaded with the officers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behind-the-scenes Maneuvers -- Meanwhile, while Mr. Best was waiting for the flight, Dr. Lenric Peters, a renowned Gambian surgeon and author, and Robert Collingwood, the European Union delegate in Banjul, had gone to see Lt. Yahya Jammeh to revoke the deportation order, but without success.  It is reported that both the Head of State and his Vice Chairman said no to the men's request. Consequently, plans went as scheduled and the &quot;Observer&quot; boss was finally deported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Best in Monrovia -- At around 7 pm Mr. Best called to say that he had arrived safely in Monrovia where he was shocked by the &quot;large turn-out&quot; that came to welcome him at the airport. As courageous as ever, Mr. Best, fondly called Bishop by the Observer staff, because of versatility in theology, sent a message to the newspaper staff that the paper was no longer his property, but instead it belongs to the people. Mr. Best left behind his wife, sisters and children and many other dependents. He came to The Gambia in 1990 and started the paper, the first ever daily newspaper in The Gambia, in May 1992. He holds a B.A. degree in English and Political Science and a Master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in the USA. He has spent over 30 years in journalism and was at one time Deputy Minister of Information in Liberia, his native country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> November 4, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An unusual collaboration between Western guitar wizard Ry Cooder and Malian bluesman Ali Farka Toure has produced one of the best-selling African albums ever, writes Fred de Vries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's a daunting task interviewing Ali Farka Toure about the exceptional album he has recorded with Ry Cooder. The man lives in Bamako, capital of Mali, and for hours on end the telephone operator can't get through. Then, when we finally manage to make some kind of connection, it turns out that Toure doesn't speak English or much French.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So we settle for a faxed interview that goes through his record company in London, is translated into French and then into a Malian language, then back into French, back into English and finally finds its way back to Johannesburg. The process takes two days. So much for the globalisation of pop and technology.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it's worth the effort. Because the result of Toure's unusual collaboration with American guitar virtuoso Cooder, Talking Timbuktu, is brilliant and deservedly one of the best-selling African albums ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's full of soothing, hypnotic music that goes way beyond the usual 12-bar blues format. The rhythms, lyrics and Arabic-influenced vocals are often very West African, while the unmistakably melancholic blues-feel makes it accessible to our Western ears. It's just a bit sad that, once again, it has taken an American name to sell an African record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fortunately, Cooder is no Paul Simon. He didn't need this album to revitalize an aching career. And consequently he didn't turn this African-American partnership into an ego trip. This is very much a Toure album, spiced up with Cooder's subtle guitar-playing and production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apparently great mutual respect exists between the musicians. During the sessions 55-year-old Toure referred to Cooder as &quot;master&quot;, which had the much younger Cooder &quot;squirming&quot;. But Toure says he used that term because Cooder is &quot;a master of the guitar&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two guitarists met in England, recalls Toure. &quot;We were both in London at the same time. So I feel (the collaboration) was meant to happen.  It's difficult to explain, but when we met, immediately there was something between us and we were sure something important could be achieved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the sake of the spoilt Western consumer, the music on Talking Timbuktu has been labeled &quot;African blues&quot;. Toure doesn't like the label, saying it doesn't do justice to the variety and the depth of the music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My music is much more than what you call African blues. It is music from deep within the cultures of Mali and it is reflective of the Malian people. I would think that what you call African blues is only one millionth of my music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, Toure, who has been called &quot;Africa's John Lee Hooker&quot;, admits to being influenced by American blues, which he first heard in the late 1960s. He was immediately struck by its similarities with Malian music, often referred to as the origin of the blues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A student friend of mine had some records of Albert King, James Brown, John Lee Hooker, Jimmy Smith and Otis Redding. And when I heard this music I knew it had been taken from here. I liked the music but I could hear it was really Malian music with small changes -- the essence of this music is African but more specifically it is Malian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Toure is clearly getting tired of that blues connection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The words in blues music don't teach us anything,&quot; he grumbles. Hence you won't find any &quot;I woke up this morning with the mean women and sour whisky blues round my neck&quot; lyrics on this album.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The theme is not wallowing in self-pity, but giving guidance and praise, as the old African troubadours have done for centuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The words of my songs deal with things that are important,&quot; says Toure. &quot;The need for everyone to work for the good of all, for all people to be truthful. The need to praise those who have done good works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These are stories with morals teaching people to move in the right direction. And those messages and themes do not change with the times.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> November 4, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The linking up of African stock exchanges should strengthen the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) as an emerging market, attracting outside investors, reports Teigue Payne</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International investment houses are increasingly positive about emerging stock markets and though Africa has hardly benefited from this trend, it is likely to soon. Some foreign investors will divert funds away from equity investment in South Africa to invest in other African markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American investment house Morgan Stanley, which launched its Africa Fund in April 1994, is one such fund which will be diverting. Within the next two years, it will be reducing its investment in South Africa and increasing it in less developed African markets, the Africa Fund's principal and portfolio manager, Marianne Hay, told the African Stock Exchanges conference in Johannesburg last week. Morgan Stanley's Africa Fund is now one of eight funds which focus on Africa. All have been started in the past few years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morgan Stanley's Africa Fund goal in allocating its assets launched was to place 50 percent in South Africa, with the rest spread between sovereign debt, investment in other African countries and investment in non-African companies which derive income from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now Morgan Stanley has decided to reduce its investment in South Africa to 35 percent of assets because this country is a relatively developed market, and a hothouse for local equity investment because of exchange control. And South Africa is flavor of the month internationally, whereas Morgan Stanley is looking for new opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currently, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Mauritius, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco have established stock exchanges. Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Cameroon are in the process of setting up stock exchanges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the World Bank's International Finance Corporation, total capitalization of African stock exchanges is about $233-billion, but of this the Johannesburg Stock Exchange accounts for $217-billion. The next biggest stock market on the continent is Cairo, which has a capitalization of $3,8-billion. Cairo has 674 listed companies, slightly more than the JSE's 647. The capitalization of African stock exchanges is tiny compared to the total capitalization of world stock exchanges of about $16-trillion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1993, the top performing African stock exchange was Zimbabwe. Its price index in US dollar terms rose 123 percent. Mauritius followed with 51 percent, Ghana with 38 percent, Ivory Coast with 34 percent and South Africa with 31 percent. Worst returns were from Botswana (-12 percent) and Nigeria (-18 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the conference, both Hay and Michael Howell, head of global strategy of British investment house Barings Securities, were highly positive about economic growth prospects in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their optimism was primarily based on expectations that the current world commodities boom will endure. But they also pointed to encouraging developments like the lifting of exchange controls, privatization, lower inflation and stable currencies in many African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Howell says Africa has received about 0,1 percent of funds flows to emerging markets in recent years. With flows to emerging markets generally expected to grow strongly, and given the brighter outlook for Africa, South Africa can expect an inflow of $1-billion to $1,25-billion a year.  Collectively, other African countries can expect $250- million to $300-million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though Africa is still blighted by perceptions that it is plagued by civil war, drought and malaise, Hay warned against viewing it as homogeneous.  Morgan Stanley, she said, views it as a sandwich: North Africa and Southern Africa, which had relatively sound economies, sandwiched sub-Saharan Africa, where there was perhaps most potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hay says investment in African emergent markets is back to front compared with other emerging markets. Companies listed on African stock exchanges are largely in consumer goods, whereas generally this is characteristic of the last stage of development of emerging markets. In other emergent markets, telecommunications and utilities like power are at the first stage. As these are now being privatized in many African countries, this indicates major investment opportunities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> November 2, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is no surprise that adequate and efficient infrastructure is the linchpin of economic and social development and the lack of it in developing countries is hampering economic growth and frustrating the reform efforts of may African governments. If we in the Gambia are to cherish our objective of promoting economic and social developments we should look to the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A growing number of countries in the region are turning to the private sector to provide efficient facilities and/or services that have traditionally been seen as natural monopolies and were heavily regulated and controlled by the state. These include: roads, transport, electricity, water, airports, and ports facilities, telecommunications, and postal services.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If an archetypal economist was asked why, in one word, society would benefit from the privatization of state-owned enterprises, and the answer would be &quot;efficiency&quot;. Private Enterprise -- It is widely accepted that government departments are managed to achieve a variety of national objectives intertwined in the complexities of politics, while private enterprises are largely managed to earn profits, and cost efficiency and market responsiveness are important to that pursuit. The more competitive the markets in which the private enterprise operates, the more it is compelled by its objective of profit and survival to operate efficiently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The widely articulated rationales for the vogue for privatization in the developing countries have generally focused on perception of waste, lethargy, economic mismanagement, inefficiency, and poor quality of service in the operations of state-run enterprises, as compared to expectations of dynamism, cost- effectiveness, high quality, accountability, and creative productivity in the operation of private enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time there appears to be a countervailing reluctance to spin activities out of direct public control, a reluctance linked to both the protection of status quo benefits and to concern over the ability of private enterprise to respond to and serve the interest of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gambia Public Sector -- The public enterprise sector in The Gambia was largely inefficient, characterized by over staffing and managerial weaknesses, which gave rise to the undue pressures on government finances and to difficulties in servicing foreign loans undertaken by these enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Structural Adjustment -- One of the key components of the structural adjustment policies implemented in The Gambia since 1985/86 has been the reform of the public enterprise sector. The broad objectives of the reform program have been to reduce the involvement of the public sector in activities that could be more effectively carried out by the private sector, and to improve the efficiency and financial performance of the public enterprises that would remain for the time being in the public sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Against this background, the reform of the public enterprise sector was expected to do the following: strengthening the management of several key enterprises, such as the GMBO, the GUC, and the GCDB; redirecting government managerial and financial resources to priority areas identified in the adjustment program; generating cash proceeds for the government budget deficit through the sale of pubic enterprises; and creating an enabling environment for new private investment, management, and modern technology in the private sector of The Gambia, that will enhance efficiency, promote greater competition in a market-oriented environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public Sector Reforms -- In designing as effective program for the pubic sector reforms there must be link between the structure of an economy (free market economy as compared to a centrally planned economy) and the ability of privatization to satisfy that country's development objectives and goals. In order to be effective, the divestiture of state owned enterprises requires a suitable set of institutions, an appropriate regulatory framework that would promote a secure environment for stakeholders through special legal prerogatives, and a market- oriented institutional framework in achieving a desirable or measurable performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to the institutional structures just described, there is another category that is essential to the success of privatization and that drives the difference between public and regulated private enterprises -the ability of government to define its influence over privatized firms. That is, the government must commit itself to laissez-faire by maintaining an anonymous and arm's-length relationship with the private enterprises. A relationship that is critical of a market-friendly economic environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the government does not have the capacity to tie its own hands and insulate the enterprises from arbitrary intervention, the expected benefits of privatization are unlikely to be realized. Political forces will influence the way the enterprises are run with little attention given profitability or cost conditions of the privatized enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example the 'de-hiring' process going on at the Gambia Airways would not have been accomplished if the government had intervened to safeguard the burgeoning unemployment rate in the country without due regard to the company's objectives of operating profitably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There must be proper legal framework that conforms with international commercial practices and conventions if the involvement of the private sector in national economic development is expected to grow and attract wary foreign investment capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Modern Concepts -- Private sector participation takes many forms including selling off existing government-owned entities, operations and maintenance contracts, build, operate (BO), build, operate, transfer (BOOT) schemes. There are volumes of articles now available on how to go about implementing concepts, but many governments are pursuing all these options, and are looking particularly to BOOS to provide financing for new investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BOO involves the award of a concession, or right, for a specified period of time by a government entity to a private investor to arrange financing, construct, own and operate a facility to provide a service. This approach has become increasingly popular and a particular appropriate form for privatizing electricity and water facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Task Ahead -- It is clear that much remains to be done to consolidate some of the gains already made in reforms of the private sector. While we continue to address the deep-rooted developmental constraints that confront our economy, the development process will unavoidably be a protracted one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An important head-start to this end has already been made. The gateway vision should be made a reality and it is only through the development of adequate and efficient infrastructure combined with other private sector reform measures can we achieve our economic objectives of being the gateway for the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the development process continues well into the 1990s, and the country finds itself delicately balanced between political change and crucial economic reforms, the growing need for efficient infrastructure far outstrips the available funding from our traditional sources of finance. We should therefore seek improvements in operating efficiently through greater private sector participation and create new points entry for private investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spurred by favorable liberalized economic policies, the spate of privatization in the developing countries are likely to continue well into the 1990s, and The Gambia should not lag behind in the race to attract foreign private investment.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> November 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports from the Nuba Mountains area of South Kordofan suggest that the Khartoum regime is intending to target the civilian population there once more. In the coming dry season the regime plans to gain control of the whole area and to finally push the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) out of the region altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Large scale troop movements have been observed in and around the Nuba Mountains in preparation for the offensive. Unlike in previous years, the regime's forces do not have instructions to capture slaves, take wives and mistresses, rape the women or ethnically cleanse the area by displacing the indigenous population to refugee camps in Northern Kordofan. This time the troops have been told to shoot on sight. There will be no subtlety about the regime's genocidal policy in this campaign. In the past, displaced civilians or escaped slaves have found an eager audience for their tales of atrocities.  The regime intends there to be no survivors this time around to tell any tales about what went on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SPLA Difficulties--The SPLA forces in the Nuba Mountains have been isolated from the rest of the organization for three years, following the schism at Nasir in 1991. They have not received their usual supplies in that time. The regime believes that there is a good chance of wiping them out completely and gaining total control of the Nuba Mountains area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already the regime has set about encircling the area under SPLA control by taking control of communication routes and traditional hill passes used by the Nuba tribes for centuries. The regime's troops have been instructed to identify and take control of the water points in the area. This will mean that any individual able to slip through the encirclement will then have to face dying of thirst. In addition, local people have been prevented from harvesting their crops, which will now be harvested by the regime's forces and used as their own supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Water and food can be scarce commodities in the Nuba Mountains, water especially, during the dry season. This is why the regime has chosen to use them as weapons against the local population. It will be impossible for large groups of people to survive the dry season if they are denied access to water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is by no means certain that the regime will be able to carry out its plan in practice. The Nuba people have watched the troop movements, been unable to harvest their crops, and so are well aware of Khartoum's intentions. The Nuba tribes know the area better than any of the soldiers or religious fanatics that Khartoum has imported into the area during the past five years of occupation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever the local traitors may have told the regime's forces, there will be plenty of secret pathways and water storage points in the hills that the regime is totally unaware of, which will hopefully ensure that the rebellion will continue beyond this dry season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unheeded Appeals--Over the past five years the Gazette has echoed many of the appeals to the international community to come to the aid of the Nuba people. In spite of the reports of massacres and ethnic cleansing, the international community has squarely failed to respond in an effective way.  There is no reason to suppose that the response will be any different this time around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is clear that the Khartoum regime has been emboldened by the lack of an effective response to its criminal activities. What does a condemnation of human rights abuses matter to a regime which places no value on human life?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This dry season the regime's plans have gone further than ever before to destroy the Nuba people, wipe their homelands off the map and destroy their cultures. Here is an abject crime against humanity constantly ignored by the international community. It is as if those crimes and atrocities which do not happen in the full glare of the international media are not considered to happen at all. In the words of one Southern Sudanese refugee, &quot;Blessed are the Bosnian Moslems, the Somalis and the Rwandans who die in front of international television cameras.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> News from Other Fronts--The regime's military build up in the South appears to be a cautious one. It seems as if Khartoum is not entirely sure whether the Mainstream SPLA under Colonel John Garang is preparing an offensive of its own, and so does not want to over extend its forces. There are other reasons for the cautious approach, however, not least of which is the lack of fresh military supplies from China. The Chinese have been responsible for supplying Khartoum with the latest military hardware in recent years but now the supplies have stopped because the Iranian government has stopped financing them. The regime has resorted to sending antiquated equipment to the South and this is likely to prove to be of dubious value in the war against the SPLA. Whether the lack of Chinese supplies will be of great significance remains to be seen because the SPLA itself has been without a foreign backer and supplier since the collapse of the Mengistu regime in Ethiopia in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concentration of Troops--Based upon recent calculations the regime now has about 110,000 troops deployed in Southern Sudan. When they came to power in 1989 the figure was a mere 20,000. The logistical problems involved in supplying such a large army spread out over the South are considerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime's forces only move out of their garrisons in large armored convoys. In order to do so, they need a regular supply of fuel. This is one of the most difficult commodities to supply to the South. Even supposing that fuel supplies can be delivered by barge, rail or air to Wau and Juba, it then has to be transported by land to the garrisons, and becomes an obvious target for SPLA attack. Scenarios such as this make it unlikely that the SPLA will be defeated in this coming dry season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Targets of the Offensive--Overall, the targets for this year remain much the same as last. The regime would dearly love to gain control of the borders with Kenya and Uganda as well as recapturing Western Equatoria from the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Troops have been preparing for breaking out from Juba and heading to staging posts in Eastern Equatoria at Kapoeta, Torit, Yei, Morobo, Kajokeji and Juba-Nimule road. The troops dispatched to Zaire and the Central African Republic (CAR), with French connivance and assistance, are far from ready for attacking Western Equatoria. They have logistical problems of their own and cannot decide how best to re-enter Southern Sudan. Troops have been concentrated at Wau in Bahr El Ghazal and at Tarekeka to the north of Juba.  These will be spearhead troops for forcing a way into Western Equatoria when that order is given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SPLA Factions--Khartoum is now experiencing the burden of being allied to the breakaway SPLA factions. These groups have splintered and formed several breakaways of their own, with the regime largely being their only means of supply. SPLA United has more or less ceased to exist. Commander Riek Machar, one of the original leaders of the schism at Nasir in 1991, is believed to have renamed his small group of supporters as the Southern Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM). &quot;Sim&quot; is an Arabic word meaning poison. If true, this latest move is an indication of Commander Machar's military weakness rather than strength. It is a last ditch effort to gain support by playing upon popular sentiments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nyuon and Kuayin--For their parts, Commanders William Nyuon Beny and Kerubino Kuuanyin Bol, although nominally still part of Reik Machar's set up, are now part of the regime's military coalition against the Mainstream SPLA.  They receive their weapons and supplies from Khartoum and have even received some reinforcements. This has constituted an additional logistical burden for the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Nyuon has moved between his three bases of Mugeri, Lopit and Torit, under the protection of Khartoum's forces. He has not staged a further attack on the SPLA, laying siege to Torit, since he was defeated in September. However, reports abound that the regime has assigned him the task of co-ordinating operations with the Ugandan &quot;Lord's Resistance Army&quot;, a rebel group in Northern Uganda trained and supplied by Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Kerubino Kuanyin Bol is based in his native Twic Dinka country of northern Gogrial in Bahr El Ghazal. It is believed that the regime intends to supply him with reinforcements from Abyei in Southern Korodofan, as well as from Aweil. Attempts to do so have been hampered by the end of season floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Kerubino survives the rest of the rainy season, the regime intends to use his forces to clear northern Gogrial district of the Mainstream SPLA and link it up with the regime's new regional headquarters at Warrap. Much of Bahr El Ghazal would then be linked up with Upper Nile, denying the Mainstream SPLA access to large parts of the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lam Akol--It is not known what Dr Lam Akol plans for the future are.  Since he was expelled from SPLA United by Riek Machar last February, he has returned to Southern Sudan from Kenya to rebuild his power base. Reports suggest he is living in his native Shiluk area of Tonja. Dr Lam Akol makes no pretenses whatsoever about his alignment with the Khartoum regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mainstream SPLA--The greatest problem facing Colonel John Garang is one of credibility as a fighting force since all the schisms in his movement.  No one denies that the Mainstream SPLA has fought a convincing defensive war for the past three years. That is above question. However, wars of liberation are never won through purely defensive actions. In the coming dry season it will not be enough for Colonel Garang's forces to merely survive. The guerrilla army needs to conclusively demonstrate that it is still an effective fighting force by going on to the offensive on at least one of the war fronts in the South.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> November 4, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United States authorities want to slap a multimillion dollar fine on an American firm that shipped 140,000 kg of toxic mercuric waste to South Africa in defiance of US law. The lethal cargo was allowed into this country in the early 1990s by the former government -- even though the cabinet had imposed a ban on imports of toxic waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Environmental groups say the case highlights the dangers of allowing toxic industrial materials into the country. &quot;This is proof that our laws are not in line with international standards and that our companies do not have the expertise to adequately handle other countries' waste,&quot; says Chris Albertyn of Earthlife Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a statutory body that monitors environment abuses in the US, said in a statement it was seeking punitive action against the Borden Chemicals and Plastics Operating Company for polluting local ground water and illegally exporting toxic materials to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The EPA said &quot;hundreds of thousands of pounds&quot; of extremely toxic mercury byproducts were illegally shipped to Thor Chemicals in Natal, supposedly to be recycled for industrial purposes. Once the cargo arrived, says the statement, very little raw material was extracted and most of the load was incinerated -- causing air and water contamination in Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A director and two senior officials from Thor, a British-owned firm located at Cato Ridge near Pietermaritzburg, are currently facing culpable homicide charges after two workers died allegedly due to high levels of mercury exposure at the factory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another worker has been in a coma for three years and 28 others have been diagnosed as having mercury poisoning symptoms. It is likely that many other employees at the plant have suffered chronic damage to their nervous systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The US Justice Department filed an indictment against Borden Chemicals in October this year after diplomatic staff at the American embassy in Pretoria carried out an extensive inquiry into the movement of mercury waste from the US to Thor Chemicals -- and the abuse of health and safety regulations at the plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While US waste management regulations made the shipments illegal, the South African government allowed the waste into the country -- even though former environment minister Gert Kotze had promised he would ban all imports of industrial toxins into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kotze justified flouting his own ban by saying Thor was able to extract useful mercury catalysts from the waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The EPA dismisses this claim and suggests the Borden-Thor transaction was a cheap way for the American firm to bypass strict controls on the management of waste in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earthlife has launched a national petition and demonstrations in protest against a recent White Paper, issued by the Department of Environment Affairs, which proposes to lift the current ban so that a subregion can be created in the country where limited amounts of waste from neighboring states can be imported into the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> November 4, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is now more than a month since the government released its Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP) White Paper discussion document, its blueprint for addressing the apartheid legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The release of the White Paper came amid tough warnings from some of the ANC's partners outside parliament that government should be careful not to water down the RDP in its attempts to appease business interests and seek reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, submissions received by the government's RDP Standing Committee have repeated some of these concerns, with the National Institute for Economic Policy (NIEP) warning that there is a danger of the RDP Base Document, adopted by the ANC and its allies as their election platform , being reduced to a &quot;fairly worthless&quot; document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The institute points to significant departures from the Base Document, as the original RDP has come to be known, and says the White Paper, in its current form, stands to become a standard to measure the progress of a &quot;very conservative austerity program&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This,&quot; it says &quot;will happen by default rather than design&quot; because of some of the deficiencies of the White Paper.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is against the background of similar warnings that the question must be asked - will the reconstruction and development strategy outlined in the White Paper propel South Africa onto a path of sustained economic growth or trap it in a cycle of poverty and continued underdevelopment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NIEP is concerned that unless the government begins to give meaningful content to President Nelson Mandela's preamble to the White Paper, it could precipitate serious problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting the preamble, in which the President says &quot;. our people have elected us because they want change. Change is what they will get. we must put firmly into place the concrete goals, timeframes and strategies to achieve this change&quot;, the NIEP says of the White Paper: &quot;The document lacks a clear statement of purpose. The process would have benefited enormously through the adoption of a more consistent and rigorous structure which includes an analysis of the situation, a summary of the policy objectives, the identification of priorities, the setting of indicative targets and time-frames.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It goes on to say that besides having &quot;significantly revised some of the major strategies and policy recommendations of the original RDP&quot; the White Paper &quot;in many cases provides neither concrete goals nor a time frame for the achievement of RDP objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NIEP takes issue with the way in which the White Paper addresses the question of fiscal discipline in the context of reconstruction and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The White Paper elaborates the second of the RDP's six basic principles saying: &quot;All levels of government must pay attention to afford ability, given our commitment to fiscal discipline and to achievable goals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on this elaboration, the NIEP says that while it acknowledges the necessity for fiscal prudence, it must be regarded as a means to an ultimate goal and &quot;cannot be taken as a goal in itself&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It goes on to add that &quot;the use of fiscal policy to mobilize funding for medium and long term objectives of the RDP has been undermined by fears of a lack of fiscal discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In this sense, the White Paper seems to reflect the preoccupation's of the old Normative Economic Model of the apartheid regime,&quot; the NIEP argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also criticizes the White Paper's lack of specific policy recommendations to implement the RDP objectives. &quot;Fears of lack of fiscal discipline, the debt trap and a rising budget deficit have meant that the potential of fiscal policy to help realize some of the medium and long term objectives of the RDP is undermined in the White Paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the recommendations, the NIEP says, lack details, such as time frames , as well as the source and amount of funding required for implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its submission, Cosatu express a similar concern, saying &quot;the White Paper's commitment to fiscal discipline must not be implemented in a way which undermines the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The RDP involves a massive expansion in welfare and service delivery by government to the vast majority of South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This may in certain instances lead to an increase in public spending and employment in certain areas, while reducing it in others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu argues that the Finance Ministry's call for government expenditure to be cut down from 22 percent of GDP to 17 percent over the next five years is driven more by a commitment to fiscal discipline than meeting the needs of implementing the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Equally worrying for the NIEP is the changing of the &quot;key role of government&quot; in economic transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The institute adds that while the Base Document says the government must play a leading and enabling role in guiding the economy and market towards reconstruction and development&quot;, the White Paper reduces this role to government simply managing the transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NIEP submission also comes out strongly against aspects of the White Paper's Economic Policy Framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It says that while the Base Document states that &quot;the RDP links reconstruction and development in a process that will lead to growth in all parts of the economy, greater equity through redistribution and sustain ability&quot;, the White Paper omits &quot;redistribution&quot; from its formulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The omission of redistribution is a serious oversight which will have dire consequences for growth and the economic development of the country,&quot; the NIEP says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We strongly believe that the need for reconciliation must not be used to undermine the need for concrete measures to ensure changes to the pattern of distribution of wealth and income in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emphasizing the importance of a coherent redistribution policy, the NIEP says redistribution is central to the &quot;attainment of sustainable growth through stimulation of domestic demand, and social and political stability.&quot; STATUS OF THE BASE DOCUMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Considerable attention has also been focused on the status of the Base Document following the release of the White Paper. Fears have been expressed in some quarters that the original RDP document adopted by the ANC-led alliance is being watered down and rewritten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RDP Minister Jay Naidoo rejected this assertion but the NIEP remains concerned at the possibility that the original RDP may still be relegated to a worthless document of intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It says in its submission: &quot;The White Paper states that the original RDP document is considered the basic starting point for the RDP White Paper.  and underpins the approach to reconstruction and development of the Government of National Unity (GNU).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the NIEP wants government to go step further than simply stating the importance of its reconstruction and development initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It says that &quot;it is absolutely necessary to have an RDP Act that recognizes the Base Document as the guiding document. In its present form, the White Paper diverts from the Base Document in significant ways that directly or indirectly undermine the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is the view of the NIEP that the proposed RDP Act should commit the government to meeting its electoral mandate and embody the basic principles of the RDP.&quot; MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the institute recognizes the White Paper's commitment to the principle of zero-based budgeting, it says government does not provide any specific time frames within which it hopes to achieve this objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu expresses the same concern in its submission, saying: &quot;The proposal for zero-based budgeting , according to which (government) departments will have to justify all their programs from scratch, could be an extremely important instrument for reorienting resources to meet RDP priorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the federation goes a step further than the NIEP, saying zero-based budgeting must be introduced as soon as 1995/96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It adds that the lack of firm target dates for the NIEP, saying zero-based budgeting suggests that the &quot;government is not confident that it can implement. zero-based budgeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In particular,&quot; says Cosatu, &quot;the continued existence of the RDP Fund over the five-year period contradicts the approach of zero-based budgeting, which should operate on the basis that the entire budget is aligned to the RDP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu expresses concern that there is still a view in government which equates the RDP Fund with total RDP spending. &quot;This threatens to reduce the RDP to a marginal program of government,&quot; it warns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NIEP also takes government to task for &quot;drastically&quot; deviating from the Base Document on the question of monetary policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Even more disturbing, is the extent to which the White Paper's discussion of monetary and financial policy deviates from the Base Document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A large number of the Base Document's recommendations that should have been elaborated further in the White Paper are not incorporated in its recommendations on monetary and financial policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Among these are the Base Document's recommendations on creating Housing Banks, Community Banks and introducing concrete policy measures to 'combat discrimination' in financial services to establish 'prudent and non-discriminatory lending criteria', to change the boards of the Mutual Funds and the Reserve Bank and to 'include representatives from the trade unions and civil society.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NIEP adds that the &quot;absence of these issues in constructing the new monetary and financial policy demonstrates the extent to which the RDP's principle of democratization of institutions and people-driven processes have been compromised in the case of monetary and fiscal policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unless these shortcomings are addressed, the NIEP warns, it will leave the concentration of financial wealth intact in the hands of a white minority. INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NIEP, while accepting that the White Paper outlines measures government will take to cushion the impact of trade liberalization, remains skeptical of the depth of commitment on the part of the authorities to such a policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the White Paper accurately reflects government policy on international trade, then why is it implementing General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) measures when &quot;an effective industrial policy is not yet in place&quot; the NIEP asks. It is also critical of the fact that government does not provide details and time frames for implementing the measures referred to above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is not only the implementation of trade liberalization measures, as required by GATT, that concerns the NIEP in the area of international economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The institute says &quot;the extension of the principle of national treatment to foreign investors means that the government will extend to foreign investors treatment no less favorable than it accords to its own investors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also expresses concern that the White Paper does not impose any performance requirements with regards to expansion, management and conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Performance requirements cover provisions such as the requirement to export at a given level, to achieve a given level of domestic content, to accord a preference to domestic goods or services, to relate to the volume or value of imports of a foreign investor, or to restrict sales of goods or services in its own territory,&quot; the NIEP points out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It however, concedes that such provisions are also absent from the Base Document but adds that the original RDP nevertheless states that the &quot;democratic government must develop policies to ensure that foreign investment creates as much employment, technological capacity and real knowledge transfer as possible, allowing greater participation by workers in decision-making.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The institute says the White Paper should have elaborated each one of these points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It cites the Australian example, where government uses the leverage of its purchasing power to influence the decisions of multinationals in order to achieve national economic goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In an arrangement established eight years ago, prior to the current GATT agreement, the Australian government set up a 'Partnership for Development Program.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Each company selling more than a defined threshold to national, state and local governments was required to enter an agreement between the Australian government and the company's international headquarters. The details were negotiated between the company and the (Australian) Department of Industry and embodied in an agreement specifying export targets and research and development expenditures, which were based on formulae relating to the company's sales revenue in Australia and its level of imports,&quot; the NIEP explains. And by the end of the agreed period, which is usually seven years, the multinational has to achieve exports to the value of 50 percent of its imports and investment in research and development to the value of five percent of its revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu is less critical of the White Paper's policy in international economic relations, saying it &quot;supports the approach to foreign investment of 'national treatment'&quot;. However, Cosatu wants government to clarify its stance on the introduction of Export Processing Zones, as well as its commitment to maintaining labor standards. LABOR POLICY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the NIEP, there are significant differences between the White Paper and the Base Document on key issues of labor market policy such as collective bargaining, living wage, workplace empowerment, training and retraining and the right to information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It says, for example, that while the Base Document supports a system of collective bargaining at national, industrial and workplace level, the White Paper's support extends only as far as national and industrial bargaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The significance of the White Paper's lack of support for workplace bargaining undermines the importance of organized labor in designing and overseeing changes, not only at national and industry level, but also at factory, shop and mine level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government's commitment to a living wage to stimulate economic growth is also questioned by the NIEP, which says that the White Paper omits an important requirement of the Base Document that argues that the establishment of a living wage is a prerequisite for economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In direct contrast to the Base Document, an argument implicit in the White Paper suggests that a living wage impedes growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Against the background of these submissions the NIEP says that in its current form, &quot;the White Paper does not provide an integrated implementation program that corresponds to the original objectives and strategies of the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Furthermore, the NIEP is concerned that the RDP might become limited to belong only a social net to cushion the effect of economic, political and social transformation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> October 24, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria earned $12.4 billion (N272.8 billion) additional revenue from oil sales during the nine months of the Gulf crisis in 1990 up to and including June 30,1994. The money came from increases in crude oil prices in the global oil market following shortfall in supplies to the market with the absence of Iraq and Kuwait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The earnings were more than the federal government's revenue projections and receipts for any single year between 1989 and 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, unlike other oil-producing countries like Saudi Arabia, Libya, Algeria and Venezuela which promptly declared their earnings and directed the monies into visible projects with benefits to their citizens, the Nigerian government said nothing about the windfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, the official government account for 1990 and 1991 released by the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, showed the government incurred a deficit for the two years. The deficit was N21.681 billion in 1990 and N35.31 in 1991. Actual government receipts were given as $7,789 billion in 1990 and $11.348 billion in 1991. The 1991 figure showed a decline of about $500 million from the budget estimates.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Keeling, a freelance reporter for the &quot;Financial Times of London&quot;, incurred the wrath of the government when he reported the windfall had been mismanaged. He was deported from Nigeria. But the curiosity of Nigerians and that of the international community had been aroused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, Pius Okigbo, an economist who headed a government panel to reorganize the CBN, said at the submission of his panel's report that the windfall amounted to $12.4 billion or N272.8 billion at the official exchange rate of $1 to N22. The panel also found that the money was not paid into the federation account as required by law but into special dedicated accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who had knowledge of, and access to it, Okigbo said, were Ibrahim Babangida, a general and the country's ruler until August 26,1993, and Abdulkadir Ahmed, who was the governor of the CBN until September 1993.  The panel found that as at June this year, only $206 million was left in the accounts. The rest, it said, had been squandered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Okigbo: &quot;They were spent on what could neither be adjudged genuine high priority nor truly regenerative investment; that neither the president nor the governor (of the CBN) accounted to anyone for these massive extra budgetary expenditures; that these disbursements were clandestinely undertaken while the country was openly reeling with crushing external debt overhang. These represent a gross abuse of public trust&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH learnt that government was surprised by both the findings of the Okigbo panel and his tough speech. When he submitted a draft to the presidency for approval, the presidency was reportedly rattled. Not knowing how best to respond to it, Okigbo was asked to help in drafting government's response. Soon after he delivered his speech, security agents reportedly took away all the copies from everyone present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil money seems to have been a major weakness of the Babangida administration as it has been of most governments in the country since oil production started in 1958.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of transparency in the management of oil revenue has become a critical question. Many Nigerians and as well as international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund, IMF, and the World Bank have consistently raised questions about the management of the country's oil revenue. The dedicated account is seen as one more avenue for leakage. The practice with dedicated accounts, according to an NNPC official, is that the government sets aside a certain amount of crude whose proceeds would be used to fund specific projects. Control of such accounts is vested in the government through the CBN governor who is directly answerable to the head of state. The NNPC is only required to advise crude buyers on which particular account of the CBN to make lodgments. How the money is eventually spent is not its responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This raises an ethical question which Abacha referred to in January when he inaugurated a panel headed by Emmanuel Abisoye, a retired major-general, to probe the affairs of the NNPC. &quot;In the past decade or so,&quot; said Abacha, &quot;there had arisen a situation whereby the average Nigerian could legitimately wonder and complain as to why his country's earnings have not been reflected adequately in the well-being of our teeming populace. In a sense, our people with some justification feel outraged and short-changed by what they regard as persistent and massive leakage of their country's external earnings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Babangida started the dedicated accounts in 1986 with 20,000 barrels per day, bpd, to fund the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas, NLNG, project.  Proceeds of the sales were paid into a special account with the Midland Bank of London to create independent revenue source for the project which nearly every government has seen as a priority project. In April 1988, new accounts were opened following the allocation of 50,000 barrels of crude per day for other projects by the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the time Babangida left in August 1993, there were at least six such accounts funded by the allocation of 105,000 barrels per day - about six percent of the country's daily output of 1,85 million bpd. By 1993, the Midland Bank account, for instance, had $3,343 billion. Government borrowed from the account and directed an additional 40,000 bpd to NNPC to recoup the debt. NNPC could only recoup part of it. When the cash call was made for equity contributions by NLNG partners, government was short of funds since &quot;the proceeds of the crude dedication was used up,&quot; said government sources.  This prompted the decision in May 1993 to sell five percent of the government's share in the NNPC/ Shell/ Elf/ Agip joint ventures and 11 percent of its shares in the NLNG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Developments like this prompted greater pressure on government for openness in the administration of these accounts. In response to the pressure of the internal community, especially the IMF and the World Bank, the present government pledged to discontinue the dedication of crude but instead to fund specific projects from direct budgetary allocation. It allocated $279 million as special treasury allocation to finance certain projects. Only the allocation for the NLNG project was to continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether this has been done remains to be seen. However, what the Okigbo panel found out does not give room for cheers, The Abacha government had actually increased the amount of dedicated oil from 105,000 bpd to 150,000 bpd at the end of June. The increase is a signal that the pattern may not have changed much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The oil industry stinks. At every stage, from production to sales administration, the oil industry in Nigeria is characterized by inefficiencies, corruption and maladministration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among all oil producing nations, Nigeria has the highest cost of production put at $6 per barrel. The range in most oil producing countries is $2.5 to $4.00. The cost is made up of $3.50 as technical cost and $2.5 as cost of new investments and operator's profit margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil industry sources say that fraud and corruption account for the high production cost in Nigeria. The sources say that these are what ordinary Nigerians are paying for with the recent increases in the price of petroleum products by the government. With that increase, a liter of petrol now sells for N11 or $0.50, which is higher than petrol prices in Brazil and Indonesia where a liter of the product sells for $0.15 and in Venezuela and Argentina where it sells for $0.05 and $0.1875 respectively. In fact, the realization that Nigerians may be indirectly paying for the large-scale corruption within the oil industry is said to have created some division within the government on the timing and the rate of price increase. The Aisoye panel is said to have recommended a phased increase only when a reliable and cheaper transportation system had been put in place. The National Economic Intelligence Committee, NEIC, is said to have recommended a 100 percent increase this year followed by a minor increase in 1995. The NNPC is said to have asked for N8 per liter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the World Bank, oil contracts in Nigeria remain unusually high. In a publication, &quot;Adjustments in Africa, Lessons from Country Case Studies&quot;, the bank said that the cost of constructing a new export terminal at Bonny for the new Port Harcourt refinery put at $340 million was too high and &quot;could be cut by two- thirds.&quot; Sources say that this view of the World Bank was confirmed by the findings of the Abisoye panel which submitted its report to the government in July. Abisoye himself had told the government at the submission ceremony that NNPC was a monument of corruption. He said: &quot;NNPC does not respect its own budgets. NNPC does not respect its own plans.  NNPC does not respect constituted authorities. The unwritten code in NNPC style of management therefore would appear to be everyone to himself and God for us all; make hay while the sun shines and loot all the lootables.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have been several cases of mismanagement of fund through questionable expenditures. Presidency sources told NEWSWATCH that the Abisoye panel discovered that N71.39 billion of oil revenue earned by the country and lodged with various NNPC accounts was misappropriated through questionable deals and fraudulent practices between 1991 and 1993. The money is made up of $3.231 billion, N329.03 million and N519.219 Dutch Mark. This amount represents about 65 percent of the federal government's budget for 1994. The money is believed to have been improperly paid out of NNPC accounts mainly on the orders of government for jobs that were either over-inflated, totally unnecessary or imposed on the corporation by top government functionaries.  And in many cases, the jobs were abandoned midway. These payments excluded the Gulf War windfall. These payments helped to build up a liability of $18 billion or N400 billion which the corporation carried as at September 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gulf War earnings remain a controversial issue. Although the Okigbo panel report said it was $12.4 billion, sources say that the Abisoye panel found far less than that in the books. An official said that between October 1990 and April 1991, the extra earnings amounted to only $2.3 billion which by January 1992 had risen to $2.4 billion as a result of interest earned on it. The earnings formed what is called the Gulf War stabilization account. Of the total sales, which should have gone directly into the federation account, a source quoted the report as saying that the $2.4 billion was not noticed. Rather, on the instruction of the president, the proceeds were paid directly to contractors handling certain projects for the government. These projects include the controversial Aluminum Smelter project at Ikot Abasi which the World Bank said was &quot;60 percent more costly than comparable projects elsewhere in the world;&quot; the Ajaokuta Steel and the Itakpe iron ore projects as well as the government's debt buy-back program between 1991 and 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The controversy surrounding the total earnings deepens with yet another claim that the Gulf War account shows net earnings to only $119 million. Dependable NEWSWATCH sources said that the NEIC, which is said to have studied the Abisoye panel report, found certain discrepancies in it.  NEIC is said to have drawn the government's attention to two figures of $2.4 billion and another $119 million in the report. The two figures could not be right, NEIC is reported to have told the government. Oil industry sources told NEWSWATCH last week that the Okigbo report approximates the truth as the earnings from the multiple dedicated oil sales do not form part of the NNPC financial records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abisoye panel is said to have found a case of immediate transfer of $755 million from NNPC's dedicated account to the CBN between April and November 1992. According to NEWSWATCH sources, the panel noted that the money was later paid by the CBN to Billingfinger &amp; Berger Bau in Germany for jobs reportedly done by Julius Berger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another contentious expenditure which the panel reportedly unearthed was the payment of $57,595,242.46 to Lutin Investment Limited for the hire of coastal vessels under NNPC's strategic floating reserve program. Of the amount, $41.1 million was paid to Lutin after Philip Asiodu, the secretary to petroleum resources in the transitional council, had canceled the contract.  The payment led to the sacking of six key officials of the corporation, including Edmund Daukuro, its managing director at the time. The men were initially charged to court but government subsequently dropped the charges.  It is believed that Lutin was a front for top people in government who influenced the corporation to make the payments even when the contracts had been canceled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH was told that the entire strategic floating vessel program is a major source for diverting fund from the corporation. NNPC relies on coastal vessels for the transportation of petroleum products from Port Harcourt and Warri to Lagos. According to Aret Adams, a former managing director of the corporation, up-till 1987, NNPC depended on major marketers for the movement of products to Lagos. The marketers used 10 vessels with average capacity of 3,000 tons but their operations were considered unreliable and inefficient. NNPC hired a consultant to review the operations of the vessels. The finding of the consultant was that the NNPC could run an effective system with only four vessels and at a cheaper cost than it was paying the oil marketers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Based on the report, the NNPC decided to hire the vessels directly.  This created another problem. Said Adams in a critique of the oil industry in April: &quot;Unfortunately, like many well-intended programs in Nigeria's public sector, that decision turned out to be a very costly mistake because in less than two years, the vessels had been increased to about 12 and most of them were provided by or through very powerful and highly influential people in the corridors of power. Many of the vessels were imposed on NNPC by the powers that be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, there are at least 22 vessels for which the corporation pays $8 million (N176 million) monthly. A recent study of the operations of the vessels called for the immediate disengagement of at least six of the vessels because they are redundant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH sources say that the Abisoye panel noted that interventions like this affect the fortunes of Nigeria's largest corporation. Although the NNPC is set up as an independent corporation which monitors government's oil interests, in practices the corporation is merely an extension of the ministry of petroleum resources. In theory, the day-to-day management of the affairs of the corporation is vested in the group managing director but in practice, the oil minister has the final say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This stronghold of government over the organization has done so much havoc to the corporation. NEWSWATCH learnt that the panel accused the government of forcing the corporation to undertake worthless projects. A NEWSWATCH source quoted the panel as observing that with government holding tightly to its equity interests in the joint ventures, NNPC lacks the capital and revenue base to operate successfully as an integrated, international oil corporation. The report is said to be critical of government practice of imposing chartered vessels on the corporation far in excess of its operational needs, directing it to make uneconomic investments, forcing it to enter into uncommercial transactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An NNPC official told NEWSWATCH last week that the corporation had become the source of free fund for government. &quot;The practice is that the ministry passes over some expenditures to the corporation to pay and debit it later. But the refund is hardly made by the ministry.&quot; He cited the case of payment of estacodes to ministry officials by the corporation. As at June, the corporation had paid N140 million to the ministry as estacode allowance.  In addition, proceeds of the sales of crude oil dedicated for the purpose of solid mineral development has been diverted by the ministry to fund non-essential services. From the proceeds, the petroleum ministry bought 70 vehicles for use by its officials as well as furnish the official residences of senior ministry staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These were all extra budgetary expenditure for which no account has so far been rendered and there is no indication that the money would be refunded to the corporation. Said an NNPC staff last week: &quot;The ministry has not undertaken any key activity in prospecting and developing solid minerals. The ministry uses the dedicated account to fund recurrent and capital expenditures not relevant to solid minerals since the account is within its direct control, unlike its vote which it gets from the ministry of finance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presidency also sources funds for many of its unbudgetted expenditure from the NNPC. In most cases, said a senior official of the NNPC, the bills are first incurred and later, the corporation is asked to pick them up with a promise for reimbursements. It never does. The panel reportedly listed one such case as the recent image polishing campaign which the federal government embarked upon in the United States. At the end of the exercise, the government is said to have asked NNPC to pick the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, government has also shifted responsibility for some of the bills incurred by its participation in ECOMOG in Liberia to the NNPC. It was the corporation which the government handed a bill of $5.83 million and N71.5 million submitted to it by Unipetrol for supplies to the peace-keeping force in Liberia. A loan of N25.4 million to the ministry defense has not been repaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One major case of government directing the NNPC to enter into a costly agreement has to do with the construction of the Bonny export terminal to serve the new Port Harcourt refinery built initially for the export market.  The $340 million contract was awarded to IPCO of Singapore last year. While negotiating for financing for the project, the NNPC had an offer from the Petroleum Financing Corporation, PFC, to fund the project with a loan repayable in 12 years, with a moratorium of 30 months. But the financing contract was rather awarded to Total on the advice of the contractor on terms which are less favorable to the corporation. Under Total's terms, it would provide an initial credit with which to open the letter of credit for IPCO.  This would be repaid from the proceeds of the 20,000 bpd allocated to Total from the 300,000 bpd meant for local refining and consumption as well as 50,000 tons per month of fuel oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IPCO's offer was more attractive but government was said to have preferred Total whose offer would eat into the crude dedicated for local consumption and invariably lead to higher imports of refined petroleum products. The panel is said to have observed that it was inconceivable that better loan facilities offered by PFC were rejected in preference to arrangements which involved eating into the domestic dedication of 300,000 barrel per day which were inadequate for domestic needs. This, of course, would inevitably result into additional imports of petroleum products to meet resultant domestic shortages, at higher cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government interference is just one problem of the oil corporation. It is when problems of the corporation include inadequate revenue and capital base for meaningful operation, operational limitations which restrict borrowing and its being limited to banking with the CBN which denies the corporation access to independent sources of fund. The inability of the government and the NNPC to meet cash-calls for operational costs is also another problem. The panel is said to have drawn government attention to some other problems such as the corporation's lack of investable funds, the tendency to fill up subsidiary boards with political appointees, unconstitutional management and mismanagement of proceeds of crude oil sales, malpractices in materials management, poor planning culture and aggressive labor unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NNPC has never been left well alone by government. The corporation has had eight chiefs executives since 1977. Virtually all of them were removed from office by the government on allegations of impropriety. The corporation has eight subsidiaries. Its major subsidiary, the National Petroleum Investment Management Services, NAPIMS, manages and supervises government investments in the petroleum sector. It is to statutorily protect Nigeria's interests in joint venture operations with foreign partners. According to Chamberlain Oyibo, group management director of the corporation, NNPC through NAPIMS monitors the oil companies to ensure that they do not unnecessarily inflate their costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This does not appear to be so in practice. The Abisoye panel reportedly found that its system of checking cash call requests by joint venture operators sometimes results in the operators getting higher amounts than they requested for. For instance, in 1992 the company approved the payment of arrears to Shell totaling $34.1 million for cash calls adjustments from 1973 to 1990, despite the fact that Shell's accounts were reconciled yearly, during that period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company Limited, KRPC, which the NNPC headquarters in Lagos claim it exercises little control over, is another problem area for the corporation. Said Don Etiebet, the petroleum and mineral resources minister, of the refinery in April: &quot;The Kaduna refinery was burnt down. It was repaired. The turn around maintenance was done at the cost of over N1 million. Seven days later, it was burnt down again. Up-till now, it is still limping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH was told that a strong syndicate of mainly importers of petroleum products has been linked with the frequent fire incidents at the refinery because disruptions in normal operations at the refineries mean good business for them. Sources in the corporation said the Abisoye panel indicted the accounting system at the refinery. In 1992, the company hired a number of firms to help it to source for foreign exchange. The firms included KC Holdings Limited, owned by one King Ibe; First Abuja Finance and Investment Company; and Oney and Zainey and Company Limited. KC Holdings was paid N2.15 million based on vouchers the company presented to KRPC from a non-existent bank, New Era Bank Plc, Ebutte-Metta, Lagos. The panel is said to have described the payments as questionable and fake. King Ibe, the managing director of KC Holdings, may be in for trouble over the payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First Abuja Finance was paid a total of N7.3 million to source for foreign exchange while Oney and Zainey was paid $35,045, NEWSWATCH learnt.  The suspicion is that some staff of the refinery might have used this avenue to defraud the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But one NNPC official in Lagos explained that the recourse to the use of scouts to source for foreign exchange is due to the poor finances of the corporation which forces it to look for alternative sources when it requires huge foreign exchange. He said that, for instance, the NNPC bought dollars in 1993 at an average rate of N30 to $1 against the official rate of N21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH learnt that in all the refineries owned by the NNPC, the panel made the same observations about the accounting systems which it said was poor. It is said to have noted cases of over-payments or payments for jobs not done. Another problem, sources say, is that the refineries are in the habit of ordering stocks that they do not really require. This leads to large scale wastage. For instance, the proforma invoice for the turn around maintenance of the Warri refinery showed several cases of forgery and inflation of the contract sum which were passed by the management of the Warri Refinery and Petrochemical Company, WRPC. These were initially blamed on PROMAS, the central purchasing organization for the NNPC, by the management of the refinery. But NEWSWATCH sources said the panel found that the managing director of the company was directly responsible for it.  Although it was gathered that he offered to resign when the case was discovered, there were no indications by last week that he had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Pipeline and Products Marketing Company, PPMC, the story is the same. Inflation of contracts is reported to be a major strategy for milking the company. For instance, two senior staff of the organization are said to have spent N5.6 million to buy a transformer that should have cost the company N2.1 million. The price intelligence unit of the PPMC at Mosimi which should look into cases of contract inflation is said to have been rendered ineffective. Staff who did not cooperate in the fraud are allegedly frustrated or forced to leave.  Other cases of irregularities in NNPC and its subsidiaries said to have been established by the panel include the duplication of payment totaling $153,003.54 and 519,210.80 Dutch Mark by the Eleme Petrochemical Company Limited to a foreign firm called Credito Italianos, the payment of N2 million to Keeler Nigeria Limited, the local representative of Windmoller and Holscher of German for the supply of film manufacturing equipment which are yet to be delivered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly although the EPCL enjoyed duty exemption since 1992, its books show the payment of N19.81 million as customs duties. Also, the panel is said to have queried the disappearance of $1.563 million from the $3.2 million contributions by NNPC between September e1991 to October 1992 towards the UNIDO Plastics Technology Center. The spending spree extends to three other subsidiaries, namely Stallion Properties, the Integrated Data Services Limited, IDSL, and the Nigeria Petroleum Development Company Limited, NPDC, according to sources. A Stallion Property, controversy surrounds the payment of N 10.5 million to a lawyer named J.O. Adekunbi. The payments were allegedly made to obtain the governor's consent for its land in Lagos State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH learnt that the Abisoye panel refused to buy the story.  Rather, sources say its report to government spoke of the panel's &quot;grave concern, the circumstances in which the management possibly defrauded the company to the tune of N10.5 million and produced receipts which we believe were forged.&quot; For IDSL, NEWSWATCH was told that the panel accused its board of exceeding its limit of authority in the award of contracts. NPDC's frivolous spending manifests in the treatment of its contractors, according to the sources quoting the panel's report. It is said to have for instance, overpaid contractor, Niger Construction Limited, based on an improper claim filed by the company. It paid another contractor, Speedwell Maritime and Freight Services Limited, N4.3 million for a job that valued at N1.3 million and for which no request for variation was to be entertained. Another contractor, Nigeria Laboratory Company Limited, was paid N756,537. 54 as mobilization fee for a contract in 1992. The contract is yet to be executed and no effort has been made by the management to recover the money. it also allegedly overpaid N1.9 million as import duties for a contract handled by Stonehill Nigeria Limited.  At NNPC, figures often do not add up, according to an auditor who once worked on the corporation's account. For instance, NEWSWATCH learnt that the panel pointed out the difference of 154,000 bpd between the Nigerian official export statistics and statistics by the IMF.  The monetary value of this is put at $1 billion per year. The panel reportedly blamed this on unofficial shipments and other physical losses. It said that the corporation lacks, amongst others, a reliable internal auditing system. What the NNPC needed, the report is quoted as saying, was a sound corporate auditing policy that would constantly remind senior personnel and higher authorities of the legal and commercial implications of their actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lack of energy policy in the country and the absence of long range planning in the NNPC have been blamed for the choice of inappropriate technology for the Warri refinery, inappropriate plant for the Kaduna refinery, the non-completion of the Pipeline and Depot Phase III project and the absence of a refinery to serve the Lagos-Ibadan axis which accounts for about 40 percent of the national demand for petroleum products, according to a source close to the panel. When he submitted the report to government, Abisoye said this much: &quot;Because of poor planning and budgetary culture, projects get injected into NNPC at any time, depending on the status of the promoter.&quot; For the current year, NNPC has a budget of N64.6 billion. This is to be funded from sales of oil dedicated to it by the government as well as earnings from its investments. A large part of this would be required to pay for the completion of its on-going 117 projects. Some of these projects include the butanisation project phase II, the pipeline and depot phase II project, the Calabar jetty phase II and the Warri Refinery rehabilitation projectors, phases I, II, and III. Others are the KRPC phase I, the repairs of the fluid catalytic cracker unit of the Kaduna refinery, the Jos tank farm project and the completion of the NNPC head office complex along Mulliner Road, Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH learnt that the Abisoye panel suggested the phasing of these projects into priority and non-priority projects. It is believed to have recommended the completion of eight top priority projects before the end of the year. This recommendation, NEWSWATCH learnt, may not suit well with the government because the projects to be completed would require at least N7 billion. NEWSWATCH gathered that the National Economic Intelligence Unit has advised government not to push the NNPC into hasty completion of the projects.  It is believed that NNPC is considering a thorough re-appraisal of some of the projects. For instance, the Bonny export terminal may not be needed in a long time to come because of diversion of products from the new Port Harcourt refinery originally meant for export into local consumption.  &quot;The expansion of the Atlas Cove at the cost of $50 million and N70 million, for instance, which NNPC is undertaking to facilitate the off loading of coastal vessels is another project which may not be viable in the future.  Once the pipelines and depot phase III projects are completed, the movement of products by sea will decline drastically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NNPC's greatest need for now is to be restructured effectively in a way that will promote efficiency and growth within the oil sector. The panel is said to have noted that the corporation is overblown and has deteriorated so badly that it will take drastic surgery to cut to size and nurse it back to good health. For this hob, the panel, according to NEWSWATCH sources in the presidency, recommended its member to work full time to reshape the organization. Dependable sources say the panel wants the NNPC freed from the ministry of petroleum resources to make it a purely commercial venture.  Although the Abisoye panel is said to have recommended a new structure for the organization, NEWSWATCH learnt that the government may prefer the recommendations of the Technical Committee on Privatization and Commercialization which have been under consideration for some time now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is believed that NEIC supports the TCPC recommendations. NEIC is said to have dismissed the Abisoye panel for failing to advance superior arguments over those of the TCPC. On the panel's alleged recommendations that it be appointed to handle the reorganization, NEIC which sources say the government referred the report to for consideration , said it was unethical and urged the government to reject it. Perhaps the most crucial decision remains the relationship between the government and a commercialized NNPC.  The panel is said to have urged the government to withdraw from the industry and allow the NNPC a free hand. At the moment, the NNPC makes all the money for government but hardly has enough to meet its obligations Outstanding commitments to join venture partners has only just been reduced from $500 million to $150 million. With declining earnings from oil, experts believe that the industry must seek commercial viability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At an interview with the &quot;Daily Times&quot; in April, Oyibo spoke of the need to free the corporation from government control so that it can operate profitably. Said he: &quot;Almost all the OPEC member countries are treating their national oil companies as purely commercial enterprise. Some of them, say, pay tax only. I saw the Mexican National Oil Company president and he said that last year, they paid $18 billion tax to the government. What the government is interested in is tax. We should take commercial decisions. We would invest where we will get returns, because whatever profit we make, the government is our sole shareholder. It will go back to the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Etiebet believes all is now well with the corporation. Last November, he swore he world conquer the powerful forces plundering the nation's oil industry. On October 7, he told a news conference he had kept his promise and the result was the improvement in the financial fortune of the corporation. He said its overdraft of N6 billion at the beginning of the year had wiped out. In the past nine months, it generated N40 billion, enough to clear its outstanding 1993 commitments of N11 billion, commit N20 billion to this year's operations and pay the federal government N3.6 billion for crude oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Etiebet said NNPC had equally met some of its pressing foreign currency commitments. It paid $766 million (N16.8 billion) into the escrow account of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Company as deposit for its shares in the firm. The payment excludes $39 million (N858 million) set aside to meet the operational requirements of the company of which it owns 49 percent equity. Etiebet said this was achieved without using the $500 million realized from the sale of Nigeria's five percent equity in Shell joint venture to Elf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To revive Eleme Petrochemicals Projects abandoned for two years due to lack of funds, NNPC paid $230 million (N5.06 billion) to the contractors and rescheduled $1.078 billion (N23.7 billion) of the project's loan. The corporation equally repaid $136 million (N2.9 billion) of the loan taken in 1986 to build the new Port Harcourt refinery. Other financial commitments of $388 million (N.5 billion) was also paid. Despite its ability to meet the financial commitments, the corporation still has problems with its foreign accounts. Etiebet said this was because NNPC had foreign accounts commitments of $4.2 billion (N92.4 billion) at the beginning of the year of which $1.2 billion (N26.4 billion) was due for payment this year. The minister is hoping that his policies of prioritisation and scaling down of projects, stopping of wasteful spending and financial discipline would turn the accounts around before the end of the year.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> October 31, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not even the prison walls could stop Ken Saro-Wiwa from winning the $250,000 1994 Right Livelihood Award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saro-Wiwa, leader of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People, MOSOP, has been in detention since May 22, this year. Coming two days after marking his 53rd birthday in detention, the award might as well pass for a birthday gift. Saro-Wiwa has won a number of international awards in the past, including the Noma Award for publishing in Africa and the Commonwealth Writers prize.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Right Livelihood Award is considered equivalent of the Nobel Prize. The award was introduced in 1980 by Jakob Von Uexkull, a Swedish-German philatelic, who felt that the Nobel Prizes have become too narrow and specialized and ignored much work and knowledge vital for the survival of mankind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like the Nobel Prize, the Right Livelihood Award is presented by the Swedish parliament. It is traditionally presented on December 9, the day before the Nobel Prize is presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a press statement, the Right Livelihood Award Foundation of Stockholm, Sweden, said: &quot;The jury honors Saro-Wiwa for his exemplary and selfless courage and in striving non-violently for the civil, economic and environmental rights of his people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saro-Wiwa shares the award with MOSOP, a body which he uses as an instrument for civil, economic and environmental rights crusade. For both Saro-Wiwa and MOSOP, the award surely comes as a tonic in a difficult moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 1992 when the Ogoni, under MOSOP umbrella, became active in their campaign against environmental degradation, never have they faced the kind of difficulty they are facing now. A number of MOSOP members and officials have been thrown into detention while several others are declared wanted by security agencies for alleged criminal acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While government is yet to react to the award, reactions from other quarters tend to suggest that the award is a vindication that MOSOP and Saro-Wiwa have been pursuing a worthy cause. The Association of Nigerian Authors, ANA, observed in a press statement that the award is &quot;a well-deserved recognition and honor for a man of letters who has refused to abandon a worthy cause in spite of draconian pressure from the minders of state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;Vanguard&quot;, in an editorial last Tuesday, said: &quot;This award has also given succor and fillip to all like Ken who feel persecuted since they would now be secured in the knowledge that thousands of miles away there are people who care and understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MOSOP described the award as &quot;an endorsement of the non-violent struggle of the Ogoni people through MOSOP for the preservation of their environment and for social justice in Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said the award was a stinging and resounding rebuke handed down by the international community to the Rivers State government and the oil company which had together misled the federal government into waging a needless war against the Ogoni people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saro-Wiwa was born on October 10, 1941, at Bori Rivers State. He attended the Native Authority School, Bori; Government College, Umahia, and the University of Ibadan. At 26, he was administrator for Bonny, Rivers State. Between 1968 and 1973, he was commissioner in three ministries in Rivers State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saro-Wiwa is an extraordinary man, an extraordinary writer. Indeed, I can think of no other writer anywhere else in the world who reproduces even half of his many facets,&quot; says William Boyd, a British writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vast ecological devastation of his native Ogoni through the activities of oil companies transformed him from a writer to an environmental activist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He certainly has paid a high prize for this. He has been detained six times since last year following his activities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NOVEMBER 14,1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Olusegun Obasanjo, former head of state, has set up a political association he intends to register as a political party. At an exclusive interview with associate editor, Wale Oladepo, Obasanjo speaks on his new moves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: What exactly is the mission of the National Unity Organisation of Nigeria, NUON, which you are forming?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OBASANJO: Well, the National Unity Organisation as its name signifies, stands for unity of Nigeria above anything else. It stands for harmony, it stands for good governance, it stands for human rights, it stands for democracy, it stands for all those things without which we cannot be seen to be making progress as a nation, either internationally or internally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: Who are the members, Sir?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OBASANJO: The membership transcends the entire country. We have members in every state of the country. We have interim officers. Interim because until we have our formal annual convention, all our offices are interim but for now I give the leadership direction to the organisation along with the interim executive council of the organisation until we have elected our permanent officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: Nigerians thrive on rumours. At a time it was rumoured that you had been contacted and lobbied to head the interim government. Now, it is being rumoured that you are coming back to politics in order to be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OBASANJO: Well, the first one, I do not know who lobbied me, at what time and where. And to head what? That is absolutely untrue. As you said, rumours grow well in Nigeria. There was a time it was said that a helicopter stopped on my farm and bla, bla, bla. You know that is absolutely untrue. On the second point that when the ban is lifted, I am going into politics, because of what I have been saying and doing. The comments I have been passing, you cannot say that they are not in a way political. But where you will be right is that our organisation will sponsor somebody when the ban on politics is lifted. That decision we have taken. What the organisation will then do after that is entirely left to the organisation. But I will be a facilitator of that exercise. But let me say this, that is not for the purpose of going back to the state house, because to me it is absolutely objectionable that anybody should form a political party because he wants to go the government house. We believe that politics has to do with the good of the people, the good of the majority and the means by which you can exercise that is through party politics. And therefore we believe we should have an association and as an organisation, we should pave the next step and we should go when the time comes, into a political organisation which will also work with others to form probably a democratic coalition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> October 25, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC) has announced that it will hand over power to a democratically elected civilian government in December of 1998. The Chairman of the AFPRC and Head of State, Lt. Yaya Jammeh made this important announcement yesterday at the Independence Stadium in Bakau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over 15,000 people of all walks of life witnessed the occasion, chaired by Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Fafa E. Mbai. Also in attendance were cabinet ministers, members of the diplomatic corps and the international community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lt. Jammeh began his address by giving the &quot;rationale&quot; behind the military takeover of July 22. &quot;The AFPRC seized power to respond to the early warnings of a potential political turbulence emanating form social injustice and human rights violations inflicted on the majority of Gambians for over 30 years.&quot; Lt. Jammeh said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Head of State stated that the AFPRC is committed to continue &quot;economic reform and related policies and programs already underway.&quot; He went on to express his Government's intention to honor all international commitments and obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consistent with the ideals and principles of the AFPRC, Lt. Jammeh asserted, the return to a democratic constitutional rule is focused on many issues highlighted.  Lt. Jammeh highlighted the first issue of a revised constitution, among others. He went on to say that the commissions of inquiry are being set up to investigate public officers, government departments, public corporations and land administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Special independent audits will also be carried out with a view to improving better management of public funds,&quot; he said. On the control of crime, drugs and other social vices, Lt. Jammeh said these constitute a key objective of the AFPRC Government during the transitional period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Government will introduce a of action aimed at controlling crime, drug trafficking and abuse, and other social vices,&quot; Lt. Jammeh concluded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> November 10, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International's Secretary-General Pierre Sane today strongly protested the escalating harassment of the human rights organization's local groups in Egypt and across the Middle East and North Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If Amnesty International members are barred from meeting to elect their own leaders, banned from carrying out their activities, and if we can't send our staff to train these members or send researchers to investigate the human rights situation, what clearer signal do we need that Amnesty International is not welcome?&quot; Pierre Sane said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of last month, Egyptian authorities banned Amnesty International's Egyptian members from holding their annual general meeting.  The government also barred the organization's international representatives from attending meetings and accused Amnesty International's organizational field worker in Egypt of carrying out &quot;illegal activities&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This action comes in the wake of the September publication of the Amnesty International report on Egypt, &quot;Egypt: Human Rights Defenders Under Threat.&quot; It detailed the arbitrary arrests of human rights defenders, including at least 41 lawyers and journalists. Egyptian police have also administratively detained thousands of suspected members and sympathizers of banned Islamist militant groups, according to the report which descr</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ibes systematic torture and the deaths of detainees while in police custody. In high-level talks in Cairo last year, officials at Egypt's Foreign Affairs Ministry repeated assurances first given in 1992 that local members of Amnesty International would soon have legal standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet those assurances have not produced any government action. &quot;For years, we have asked the government to give our groups legal recognition in Egypt and instead they are taking steps to silence us,&quot; Pierre Sane said. &quot;I find it hard to reconcile this with President Mubarak's statement to us in 1992 that Amnesty International is welcome in Egypt, providing that it does not concern itself with the internal politics of the country.&quot; Amnesty International has always operated openly and within the law, keeping authorities informed of its peaceful activities carried out in solidarity with the victims of human rights violations worldwide. Amnesty International's own procedures provide that members campaign on behalf of individual cases of human rights violations throughout the world -- but not in their own country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The de facto banning of Amnesty International in Egypt fits a pattern of harassment that Amnesty International members, delegates and staff members face elsewhere in the region. In Tunisia, the government has harassed the Amnesty International section for over two years, blocking publications from entering the country, and so preventing its members from receiving the basic tools to carry out their normal activities. They have received no mailings of the organization's newsletter since April 1994 nor copies of the annual International Report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tunisian authorities have imposed administrative impediments and restrictions on the Amnesty International section and have banned a member of the International Secretariat from visiting the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Kuwait, the local Amnesty International groups applied for registration two years ago. Despite support by the parliament's Human Rights Committee, authorities continue to refuse legal registration to the groups and consequently imposes restrictions on their activity. The Kuwaiti Government has also denied entry visas to the Amnesty International membership development team for more than two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a dangerous trend of harassment and restrictions on human rights organizations -- not just Amnesty International -- across the Middle East and North Africa,&quot; Pierre Sane said. &quot;Authorities deliberately create a gray area by refusing legal recognition of human rights organizations, imposing restrictions on their activities and banning their meetings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While governments in the region are pleased to proclaim the existence of Amnesty International groups and members in their countries in international human rights fora, this does not stop these same governments from targeting the organization's members, staff and delegates -- apparently in response to Amnesty International's worldwide campaigning activities against human rights abuses in these countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We shall not remain silent,&quot; Pierre Sane said. &quot;Such action against our movement simply reinforces our resolve to fight against human rights abuses and re-affirm the principle of international solidarity among defenders of human rights worldwide.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> October 25,1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The subject was so commonplace and the details deemed so inconsequential they were awarded just one sentence near the bottom of a column of international news briefs. Under the headline &quot;poverty trap&quot;, The Times of London reported that the World Bank could not release up to $250 million in loans to Rwanda until the Government of the devastated African country paid off $3.75 million in arrears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To the Bank's many critics, it was yet another example of the gross inefficiency of the world's largest lending institution and its twin, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), born 50 years ago in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opponents charge that with more than one billion people living in absolute poverty, 40 per cent of the population in developing countries lacking basic sanitation or clean water and the gap between rich and poor growing wider, the two bodies, committed to the reduction of global poverty, have proved a disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(Their) policies are failing precisely the people they are supposed to help, the poorest in the developing world&quot;, says Michael Taylor, director of Christian AID, a British NGO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Christian Aid and a group of other Third World charities were pressing for reforms to the World Bank and IMF at the 50th annual meetings of the Washington- based institutions in Madrid, on October 4-6. Critics want the debt of developing countries substantially reduced, controversial structural adjustment programs (SAPs) altered and the two bodies democratized so that they are more accountable to taxpayers in rich countries and recipients in poor nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> World Bank officials admit their record has not been perfect, but they insist the institution has contributed to global economic and social progress in the past half century. In developing countries, average life expectancy has increased by about 50 per cent; the proportion of children attending school has risen from less than half to more than three-quarters; and average income per person has more than doubled, they note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spokesperson Geoffery Lamb, said the Bank will continue to fund &quot;free market friendly&quot; projects because, despite the short-term negative impacts on social programs, SAPs are the best way to go about reducing poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lamb admitted that the social components including health care and education of the first generation of SAPs - large loans to continue contingent on them liberalizing their economies - had been &quot;quite inadequate&quot;, but current policy is aimed more at softening the blow for the poorest of the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Increasingly, we will not lend in situations where we are not satisfied of the viability and proper implementation of a project,&quot; Lamb told reporters at a news conference releasing the Bank's 1994 annual report.  &quot;Which is not the same as saying we will not make any more mistakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No matter which side of the debate they are on, a few people dispute the fact that global aid has changed dramatically since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The former Soviet Union, once a large aid donor, has not only stopped paying out, but, along with its now-independent republics and other former Eastern bloc allies, has become a major recipient of assistance from main global lenders - the World Bank/IMF, the 22-member organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and regional development banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world's poorest countries have paid a heavy price for this shift.  In its report earlier this year, the OECD noted that total assistance to developing countries in 1992 reached a record $159.1 billion, a 21 per cent increase from the previous year. But further examination of the figures for so-called development finance, shows continuation of a disturbing trend for have-not countries. Concessional money - cut-rate loans, grants and other concessions - fell 3.5 per cent between 1991 and 1992, while private flows-direct investment, international bank lending and other private money-increased by nearly 35 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between 1984 and 1992, private flows increased from just over 39 per cent to nearly 57 per cent of OECD countries' total resources to the developing world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few people dispute individual business investment is needed to make the world's poorer countries more self-sufficient. &quot;Aid should never be looked at as the solution to poverty worldwide,&quot; says Harriet Lamb, of the World Development Movement (WDM), a British NGO. &quot;No country wants to be dependent on aid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as private investment figures show, that is exactly what is happening. It is typically only a select few &quot;economically attractive&quot; nations that get the money. According to the 1984 United Nations Human Development Report, although private flows to developing countries have increased dramatically in recent years, between 1989 and 1992, 72 per cent of the money went to just 10 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa received just a 6 per cent piece of the pie and the least developed countries only 2 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lamb of WDM said economic adjustments are definitely needed in poor countries to reduce poverty and make them more efficient and attractive to foreign investors but the SAPs are being universally applied without taking into account differences between the nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lamb added that developing nations' debt- which according to the World Bank was $156.4 billion, or nearly 54 per cent of the gross national product of sub- Saharan Africa in 1993 - must be reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most observers say aid to developing countries is a question of priorities on the part of donor nations and recipient governments. As long as richer nations put winning new markets for domestic products and securing contracts for their industries ahead of improving the lot of the poor, few see poverty being tamed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Human Development Report notes that only 7 per cent of the funds from bilateral donors is directed to education, primary health care, rural water supplies, nutrition programs and family planning services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those crucial areas be paid for by diverting small percentages of the budget developing countries devote to military spending. About 12 per cent of the $125 billion those nations put toward defense in 1992 would provide primary health care and safe drinking water for all.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEEKLY MAIL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> November 18, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While attention focused on the signing of an Angolan ceasefire in Lusaka, Phillip van Niekerk visited the scene of the battle -- and found a city that resembles Dresden in 1945</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Angola &quot;story&quot; achieved some prominence again this week, in a strangely disembodied way. The rest of the world, alerted by the trigger-word &quot;peace&quot;, finally sat up and took notice, but they had first to be reminded that an awful war was underway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week I walked among the rubble of Cuito, a provincial capital east of Huambo in Angola's central highlands. A visit here is disturbed by blasts. Not artillery shells, but the sound of people treading on landmines or children picking up handgrenades. Relief workers say four or five people blow themselves up each day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angolan government troops drove Unita rebels out of Cuito in July. The city of 140 000 was left with one of the highest amputee populations in the world and a skyline that resembles Dresden in 1945.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a pocked city littered with rubble. There is not a tree without bullet holes. The facades of the once lovely Portuguese villas look like they have been bashed by a gigantic sledgehammer. Perhaps, one might imagine, such devastation is to be expected after 20 years of war. But it has taken only two years to destroy Cuito and most medium-sized cities in Angola. It took much longer to wreak less destruction in former Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What has gone missing is an understanding of what has happened here.  Until the October 1992 elections, the Angolan war was fought mostly in the bush, touching a handful of urban settlements in the south-east of the country. During a brief window of peace in 1992, Angola was still intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Unita leader Jonas Savimbi went back to war at the end of 1992 he seized the cities. These have become ferocious battlegrounds during the past year as the war has turned in favour of the government. Unita has been dislodged from one city after the other in struggles more reminiscent of Stalingrad than anything encountered before in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These names mean nothing in the West: N'dalatando, Milanje, Sauremo, Huambo. They were each home to hundreds of thousands of people and now they are ruins. Only Luanda, Lobito-Benguela and Lubango have survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For 18 months, the frontline in Cuito was Joaquim Kapango Street, the main street, named after an anti-colonial guerrilla hero. Ten metres of tar separated Unita from the MPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For nine months there was no humanitarian assistance. No one will go on record but it is widely known that some people resorted to eating corpses.  The same people who tell you this say the dogs were eaten. Indeed, there are no dogs left in Cuito.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rest of the world may have been in the dark, but it was not without its contribution. At last count, 68 different kinds of explosives from 23 nations have been found in the rubble of Cuito -- even British handgrenades of early World War II vintage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The biggest threat is to the children. A cluster bomb looks like a shiny toy. Every day those who are lucky enough to survive have limbs amputated at the Fellini Hospital -- so named by the French doctors who opened it in February on the day when the great Italian film director died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The inhabitants of Cuito are camping in the husks of former apartment blocks, in tents and in a destroyed football stadium. Not wanting to risk more of the living by crossing minefields to bury the dead, makeshift cemetries -- little mounds with wooden crosses and flowers -- have been constructed in people's back gardens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government appears to have abandoned all pretence at serving its people in favour of pursuing a war that the hawks are increasingly confident they can win without having to compromise to the terms of a peace treaty. The Angolan army has been rebuilt at vast cost to the country's oil reserves and with the help of South African soldiers from Executive Outcomes, who have played a major role in turning the war around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been left to the International NGOs to take over the distribution of food, medical care and the welfare of the Angolan people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The human rights group, Africa Watch, this week charged both the MPLA government and Unita of human rights violations, including summarily executing opponents. The government's armed forces, Faa, also stands charged of indiscriminate aerial bombardment of population centres, while Unita is accused of mass abductions and starving civilians by attacking relief operations, mining agricultural fields and killing those tending their fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That this catastrophe has gone largely unreported is partly the fault of the competing armies, who have kept journalists away from the frontlines.  It is also the fault of the news agency format that is a conduit for every piece of war propaganda uttered by the two sides. The resulting slew of contradictions are usually far too confusing for foreign editors, let alone the man in the street, many thousands of kilometres away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angola is bad television. It is a fertile country. If the crops are not planted, there are always roots or wild berries to eat. People are starving in Angola, but it cannot compare to the Horn of Africa, the misery of which is a familiar image in the jaded consciousness of the Western viewer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ten days ago I visited one of the worst sites of misery that aid workers have been able to get to. Balombo is a small town 112km west of Huambo. It has changed hands between Unita and the MPLA five times since 1975, last being recaptured by the MPLA in October 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Encircled by the rebels and with a short, battered runway that prevented relief flights from getting in, it was cut off from the rest of the world until four weeks ago when government forces mended the runway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since January, 928 people out of a population of 17 000 have starved to death. It is a town of stick figures, of emaciated people. In a room that serves as a clinic, skeletal children and puffy &quot;kwashie&quot; babies cling to their mothers' breasts that have been sucked dry of milk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike what would have been the case in Sudan, the situation has improved dramatically since flights started coming in. With the rainy season weeks away, and Unita pushed out of the surrounding territory, peasants were out planting the seeds that reached them just in time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luanda absorbs all the shocks that strike the interior. Refugees fleeing this war of a thousand fronts are packed tightly into slums, or bairros, built on former market gardens, in factories or in city parks. One rose on what used to be Luanda's rubbish dump where the stench has never quite dissipated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A city that was built for 600 000 people at most now holds anything up to three million -- almost a third of the Angolan population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luanda is a city of hard times where nothing is cheap. The minimum wage is 240 000 kwanzas a month -- about half an American dollar. It costs twice that a month to send your child to private lessons, which is the only way he or she will be educated; a quarter of your month's wage for a loaf of bread; one eighth for a bucket of clean water; one sixteenth to shit in private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women sell in the markets in a desperate scramble to keep up with inflation, estimated by the World Bank last year at 1 800 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But what is there to sell in this city? Anything that has the slightest economic value. One family is in the toothpaste business. The children rummage through the rubbish dumps for spent toothpaste tubes that the adults scrape out until they have a full tube to sell in the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Luanda is not a life. Out of the debris of ideologies that have brought destruction, the only comfort is the preaching of the evangelical pastors on Sunday. The people who cram into the bairros believe that when the war is over, they will go home, to Milanje, to Zaire province, to Bie and Lunda Sul, and to Huambo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those returning to the countryside have the best hope of restarting their lives. Those going back to the provincial cities will find devastation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cuito has been so badly damaged that some officials have suggested it be written off and a new city constructed alongside. Even while they dither, the people have themselves started rebuilding. In Cuito, the street market is bustling again. On sale were onions, car parts and, significantly, rows of nails neatly sorted into different lengths. The World Bank officials in Luanda, wary of stepping on mines, haven't even travelled to Cuito yet to revise the costs of reconstruction but the people of the city have started the enormous process of rebuilding their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the war's greatest victims, the peasants, there is an almost mystical optimism that this time the fighting is over, contrasting with a worldy wise cynicism in Luanda. News of the peace talks travels by radio and bush telegraph. Everyone in the villages around Balombo, even those who cannot tell you their age, know the latest from Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If they had the time, they might reflect that they are not just victims of the MPLA and Unita warmongers. One of the pities that this war has gone unreported is it lets off the hook international players who need their noses rubbed in the fly-ridden rubble of Cuito. Like the Portuguese, who created the original mess, and the Americans and the Russians who used Angolan lives as pawns in their global chess game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then there is the United Nations, which forged ahead with an unrealistic election date, ignoring warnings that Savimbi still had an army, because it didn't want to waste more money on an unsexy Third World country.  For that mistake, at least 100 000 more Angolan civilians have died. The UN stood back feebly while Savimbi took the country back to war. The government had largely demobilised and was left without an army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This makes the revamped Faa's offensive in recent weeks, its instinct to go for the kill rather than another treaty with a doublecrosser, its willingness to rely on its own strength rather than on international guarantees, at least understandable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most importantly, South Africa -- in particular the militarists of the National Party government -- have a lot to answer for. They spent millions of our tax rands to build up and defend Savimbi, providing him with the power base to hold his country to ransom and destroy it for the sake of his personal ambition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yes, we paid for it. We all had a role in reducing Angola to beggary.  Still, the darkness permits us to ignore it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. -- The Angolan civil war, once one of the most divisive Cold War issues in American politics, has resurfaced on the U.S.  foreign policy agenda. Now, however, there is more agreement than discord, with both the Democratic administration and the incoming Republican leadership in Congress pressing the Angolan parties to adhere to the peace accord that was signed in the Zambian capital Lusaka on November 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the weeks prior to the signing ceremony, the White House and Capitol Hill Republicans appealed for cessation of the continuing carnage, which has claimed at least 100,000 lives in the past two years and has, until this point, defied diplomatic solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jesse Helms, in his first foray into Africa policy since the Republican election victory that puts him in line to chair the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a sharp rebuke of the recent Angolan government offensive against the rebel movement Unita. Likening recent developments to the plot of a Frederick Forsyth spy novel, the North Carolina conservative accused the Angolan army of employing South African mercenaries who once fought with Unita in an attempt to &quot;destroy the Unita army and assassinate Jonas Savimbi,&quot; the movement's leader.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dan Burton, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa, cabled Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos &quot;to deplore in the strongest possible terms&quot; the government army's offensive. &quot;I urge you to stop this madness and honor the cease-fire immediately,&quot; Burton said. Both Helms and Burton have corresponded with Savimbi as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an earlier statement issued by the White House, the Clinton administration also criticized the government's battlefield actions for undercutting &quot;the spirit of national reconciliation&quot; displayed during peace negotiations in the Zambian capital Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During heavy fighting in early November, government forces captured the central Angolan city of Huambo, where Unita has been headquartered, and also attacked Unita in several other areas, including the town of Uige.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Antagonism between Unita and dos Santo's MPLA dates from the early 1970s, during the struggle against Portuguese colonialism. Fighting between the two groups intensified following independence in 1975, fueled by superpower rivalries. The MPLA received arms and aid from the Soviet Union and troops from Cuba, while Unita allied itself with white-ruled South Africa and was funded and armed by the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 1988 regional peace accord led to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and to South Africa's pull-back from Namibia, Angola's southern neighbor. In 1991, Angola held internationally monitored elections, which dos Santos won by a narrow margin. Fighting resumed in late 1992, following Savimbi's rejection of the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the latest set-backs, many observers believe both sides eventually will abide by the new accord, hammered out during months of negotiations in Lusaka coordinated by a United Nations representative. The Clinton administration has backed the talks, assigning veteran diplomat Paul Hare as special envoy to bring the long-feuding parties together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Savimbi, who once was enthusiastically embraced as an anti-Communist warrior by Republicans, as well as some Democrats, lost most of his support following the 1991 election fiasco. But the latest turn of events, coinciding with the Republican ascendancy in Congress, has provided him with a public relations boost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Militarily, Unita is the weakest it has been since 1976,&quot; says Shawn McCormick, director of the Angola Study Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. &quot;Savimbi can't afford to take a political hit as well, so he needs international condemnation of the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Capitol Hill, even Democrats who have been critical of Savimbi feel the government shares the blame for the recent diplomatic stalemate. &quot;We agree with almost all the Republicans are saying,&quot; said one Democratic Congressional aide. What Democrats don't support, the aide said, is the threat to pressure dos Santos with economic reprisals. Helm's letter, which was addressed to National Security Advisor Anthony Lake, calls on the administration to &quot;consider oil sanctions&quot; and to &quot;publicly identify Angola as the pariah regime it has become.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burton, too, pledged support for &quot;severe financial, political and military sanctions&quot; if the government refused to honor the cease-fire accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angola produces a light crude oil that is highly desirable for making unleaded gasoline. Most of the country's output is purchased by the United States, and Chevron and several other U.S. firms have major operations there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by their post-election reactions to the Angolan problem, Helms and Burton have signaled they will be actively monitoring the administration's Africa policy. &quot;There is agreement among key Republicans that there needs to be a new focus on a few keys countries in Africa such as Nigeria and Zaire, where U.S. interests are at stake,&quot; says one Capital Hill source who has been involved in several foreign policy strategy discussions. The Republicans also want to reduce foreign aid overall and likely will want to reduce the aid package for South Africa, in favor of maintaining assistance to some other African countries, the source says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> December 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Windhoek-based Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA), whose members include independent news publications throughout the region, is demanding that sanctions be imposed on southern African governments which abuse media freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a resolution adopted at the close of the organisation's annual general meeting in Swaziland, MISA demands that members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) sanction fellow SADC governments which do not abide by the 1991 Windhoek Declaration of Promoting a Free and Pluralistic Press in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Windhoek Declaration, which has been adopted by SADC governments, recognises that media freedom and diversity are essential ingredients of social and economic development. In its resolutions,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MISA further calls on the international community to &quot;pressurise&quot; countries which continue to violate press freedom in southern Africa.  Swaziland, Angola and Zambia are singled out by MISA as currently having the worst media freedom records in the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MISA annual congress -- held near the Swazi capital Mbabane and attended by more than 50 media workers from throughout the SADC region --also saw the presentation of MISA's annual Press Freedom Award, which this year went to Zimbabwean journalist Basildon Peta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MISA award is given in recognition of outstanding contributions made by southern African journalists to the promotion of media freedom in the region. In March this year, Peta -- a 24-year-old reporter with the Harare-based Daily Gazette newspaper -- was repeatedly detained, interrogated and finally charged by police in terms of the country's Official Secrets Act, after he exposed massive tax evasion by companies owned by the ruling ZANU-PF party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During five days of incessant questioning, police tried to make Peta reveal who had given him information about the fraud. However, Peta remained true to his p professional ethics and refused to reveal his sources, and it was for this that he was honoured by MISA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presenting the award at a gala ceremony on November 22 was Kenyan journalist and human rights lawyer Gitobu Imanyara, who in recent years has been jailed and harassed by the Kenyan authorities for his ardent pro-democracy campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Basildon Peta refused to be dictated to,&quot; Imanyara said before presenting Peta with the MISA award. &quot;He showed no sign of fear and behaved in the best traditions of a journalist. He is a brave son of Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Describing the award as the &quot;best thing&quot; ever to happen to him, Peta said he was not going to rest on his laurels. &quot;This award has placed a great responsibility on me, and this responsibility is for me to persevere... I am therefore not going to reveal my sources to anyone, even if they take me to jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the Zimbabwean authorities have since dropped the case against Peta for lack of evidence, the charge could be reactivated any time during the next two years. &quot;I will maintain my stance and I will do exactly what I have been accorded this prize for -- that is to maintain professionalism and excellence in the profession,&quot; said Peta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MISA Trustee Justice John Manyarara, a retired Zimbabwean High Court judge, told the award ceremony that a journalist's duty was founded on &quot;courage and commitment to the ethics of journalism&quot;. &quot; (Excellence in journalism) finds its expression in a press that promotes justice, peace and respect for human rights and the rule of law,&quot; said Justice Manyarara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following resolutions were passed at the MISA annual meeting:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. MISA, noting that all SADC governments are signatories of the 1991 Windhoek Declaration on Promoting an Independent and Pluralistic African Press, demands that they impose sanctions on member countries who do not abide by the terms of the declaration. Such sanctions can be applied in terms of Article 33 of the SADC treaty. MISA further calls on the international community to put pressure on countries which continue to violate press freedom in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. MISA is appalled that the Government of Swaziland -- a signatory of the 1991 Windhoek Declaration on Promoting an Independent and Pluralistic African Press -- does not have constitutional provisions which guarantee press freedom, and calls on the Swazi Government to introduce internationally accepted norms of media freedom. MISA, in solidarity with Swazi journalists, demands that the Swazi Government stops its harassment of media practitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Considering the pressures on journalistic activities, and obstacles to the development of a free, independent and pluralistic media in Angola; Taking into account evidence of the reinforcement of governing-party control, censorship and manipulation of state-run media; And considering the recent appeal of the Angolan President for a pluralistic media in the context of the post-Lusaka peace agreement, MISA's annual general meeting:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a) Reiterates its deepest concern at the government and Unita's restrictions on the activities of journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> b) Calls on the parties in Angola to commit themselves to the 1991 Windhoek Declaration on Promoting a Free and Pluralistic African Press, and to promote a culture of peace and national reconciliation through the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. This meeting condemns the on-going harassment of The Post newspaper in Zambia , and of its Managing Director Fred M'membe in particular, and further calls on the Government of Zambia to scrap those clauses in the Leadership Code of Ethics Bill that require journalists writing about political leaders to appear before a tribunal to justify stories and to disclose their sources of information. This clause undermines press freedom, gives exclusive privilege to a few individuals in society, and breaches ethical demands of the profession of journalism .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. This annual general meeting of MISA confirms an earlier call for the ending of monopolies in the electronic media. It further calls on governments in the region to transform state-controlled media into independently controlled public service media, and to abstain from interference of any kind in these media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. To facilitate the free flow of information, MISA calls upon SADC member governments to scrap visa and accreditation requirements for journalists working in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. In light of continued harassment of journalists throughout the region, MISA h as decided to set up a &quot;hotline&quot; to advise media in the region. The hotline will l be set up in tandem with a legal trust fund, and used to defend journalists against infringements of their fundamental rights to freedom of expression. The purpose of the hotline and the fund is to assist those media practitioners who would otherwise not have access to legal advice, or to legal advisers who are familiar with media law. 8. MISA, recognising that the new South Africa has seen fit not to set up a Ministry of Information, urges all other SADC member governments to emulate this example.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THERE'S a lot riding on director Darrell Roodt's film of Alan Paton's Cry, the Beloved Country, produced by Anant Singh. It's the first major post-election film production.  A new beginning? Yes, thinks Roodt, when you can pin him down during reshoots in Kliptown, just outside Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Things have changed. Some people argue not, but there's a cultural shift. People want to examine their history, their roots, to look at where they are now. It's very important to make films to do this.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The set is near Freedom Square, where the Freedom Charter was signed.  Two kids wrestle, oblivious of the equipment that signifies &quot;movie being made&quot;. It's difficult to tell who lives there and who are extras. A woman with a bundle of sticks on her head sways past. &quot;Perfect,&quot; says production designer David Barkham. She was unplanned. A mangy dog sniffs at a pair of discarded shoes. No, they're props.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barkham tells, in a voice modulated to talking quietly after a bearded crew member calls &quot;roll sound&quot; and we all have to shut up, how they wanted to film in a nearby Zionist Christian Church. They were refused permission although the church was poor, and they offered a lot of money.  &quot;We would have cleaned and painted it as well,&quot; says Barkham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now carpenters are building a facade of the church several blocks from the set, with interiors in a studio. Barkham wonders what the parishioners will think when they see their church on screen. They really wanted to film in that church -- it used to be a movie theatre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Fifties props were easier: things like cars, an aeroplane -- &quot;we found one straight out of Casablanca&quot; -- and a train. In fact, they have two trains. One was to be filmed at Pietermaritzburg station, but wires got crossed.  The station was being painted so they had to relocate to Pretoria, with a new train. This one will be painted in colours that wash off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it's all in a day's filming. James Earl Jones, who plays pastor Stephen Khumalo, searching for his son in crime-ridden Johannesburg, is between takes. How does he feel playing a South African? He is soft-spoken, in spite of the famous booming voice. The quality he looks for is &quot;humility&quot;. That's not easy: &quot;Even to wake up in the morning is an act of arrogance -- you take on life! But Khumalo's humbleness is more than social, he walks in the steps of Jesus, as best as he can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jones had a &quot;vision of Khumalo&quot; before he started filming.  &quot;His journey is from a peaceful countryside blessed by nature, to Johannesburg, a journey to Purgatory and Hell.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jones hasn't seen as much of South Africa. &quot;It's hotel, highway and set.&quot; He'd like to return with his family, &quot;not as tourists, but to meet others in the same industry&quot;. The poverty in Kliptown, though, upsets him: &quot;the quaintness wears off and rage sets in&quot; at the way squalor wears the spirit down. He's not a critical outsider -- he feels the same about similar parts of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international media have been watching filming.  Newsweek, The New York Times, international television crews have all paid a visit. Locally, though, there are some rumblings about &quot;colonialism&quot; in the choice of novel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I kind of agree with that,&quot; says Roodt, &quot;but we're now allowed to approach the book with a Nineties perspective.  The original film was colonial; the characters one- dimensional, divided between good old British upper-class guys and noble peasants, a bit too rah-rah. I'm making it more human.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Confrontational protest films are over, he says: &quot;Friends was the last nail in the coffin of that kind of cinema.  Finish! Finish! Enough now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The novel, says Roodt, &quot;is the one definitive classic about contemporary South Africa, and still surprisingly relevant&quot;. It is much more &quot;philosophical about the dilemma of apartheid, although it was written before apartheid was legislated. It's about forgiveness, looking forward, understanding.&quot; In other words, it's universal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But does it matter if the novel is colonial? On set, one realises that Paton's words are getting a new, different life in that mysterious process of becoming a living, visual thing -- a film. This isn't martial arts junk for video, a sure-fire money-maker. Instead, they're thinking South Africa -- and that takes enormous courage and faith in film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We might have a movie industry after all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;African authors have the potential to take the world by storm. They have a fresh message that comes very close to the true nature of people. It's a message that is of intellectual significance for the whole world,&quot; Zimbabwean publisher Paul Brickhin believes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Actually the Germans are reading the words of more and more African authors. These writers include the Nigerian Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinka and his countrymen Chinua Achebe, the Senegalese woman author Mariama Ba, the Kenyan Ngugiwa Thiong'o, and Chenjeri Hove, Shimmer Chinodya and Tsitsi Dangarembga of Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, now as before, it is not easy to gain a foothold in Europe with African fiction. There are plenty of good manuscripts, but the African publishing business is not sufficiently developed to assert itself and its authors on the world market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the voice of Africa to be heard worldwide, despite this drawback, this section of global literature needs purposeful promotion. A first important and expensive step in this direction is the translation of the original manuscripts. For this reason, the German Foreign Ministry together with the Swiss Cultural foundation PRO HELVETIA has supported the translation into German of 34 African novels alone in the last 10 years. Translating is done through the Gsellschaft zur Forderung der Literature azusAfrika, Asien and Lateinamerwika e.V., in Frankfurt/Main, which was founded especially for this purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This programme, which aims at encouraging German-language publishing companies to venture into literary discoveries which can help make literature from the South better known in Germany, has promoted important African authors. They include Dambudzo Marechera of Zimbabwe, the South Africans Peter Abrahams, Richard Rive and Mongane Wally Serote, Amadou Hampate Ba of Mali, an Henri Lopes of the Congo. Some translation have in fact become commercial successes, such as the book &quot;Die Nacht des Baobab&quot; by the Senegalese Ken Bugul, and the works of the woman author Bessie Head, who hails from South Africa. Their books, whose hard-cover editions were co-financed by the Foreign Ministry, have also been available as paperbacks for some years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The applications for promotional funds come from German publishers.  They commit themselves to adopting one novel, from the sub-Saharan region in their programmes when they receive subsidies for translation costs. A committee in which the Federal government, the Protestant Church and institutions of foreign cultural policy cooperate decides on the commissions.  The Gsellschaft zur Forderung der Literature aus Afrika, Asien und Lateinamerika e.V. has been the launching pad for this translation promotion, the like of which is to be found in no other European country, since 1984.  The Foreign Ministry has made DM 100,000 available for this project in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the publishing houses which for some years have committed themselves to the presence of African literature on the German book market are the Peter Hammer Verlag in Wuppertal, the Verlag Oto Lembeck in Frankfurt/Main, the Lamuv Verlag in Gotingen, the Jurgen Horlemann Verlag in Bad Honef, the Deutch Tschenburch Verlag (dtv) with its series &quot;Drei Kontinente&quot;, and the Marino Verlag (formerly Kyrill &amp; Method), both in.  Munich.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WAKAFRIKA is a Manu Dibango opus -- an album of African classics by one of Africa's classics. Wakafrika? Vuka Afrika! This is a collection of anthems African, Africanised and Africaine. Recorded during 1993, the album was a 60th birthday project for Dibango, a celebration and collaboration with a flock of Africa's stars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wakafrika comes to us in South Africa as a call back to our continent after years in the wilderness. Sure, we've rejoined the Organisation of African Unity and the United Nations. But Dibango is the African ambassador leading us back to the music, musicians and heart of modern Africa -- with a little help from his friends: Ray Phiri, Angelique Kidjo, Salif Keita, Sinead O'Connor, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Peter Gabriel, Youssou N'dour, and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The album offers a crash course in contemporary African music. It's an anthology of modern African tracks, packaged with Dibango's rich Franco-Cameroonian treatment. We know many of the songs, if not their names.  Pata Pata in a pan- African style? Wimoweh? Homeless? Melodies creep up from behind, like old friends. Familiar sounds are discernible within the layers and textures of Dibango's teasing arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soul Makossa, Dibango's inescapable classic, is served fresh as always. N'dour's distinctive staccato phrasing slips tight into the funky guitar of the makossa groove, then soars high as the Senegalese singer makes his stamp on the 1972 classic. The makossa party's happening: brass swirls and swells, rhythm cycles to a standing wave for a moment, and contortionist N'dour climbs atop the groove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minimalist drum and percussion set up Peter Gabriel's Biko.  Horns state the mournful lines of the familiar Biko chorus; a melancholy guitar lick, then enter the choir featuring Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Geoffrey Oryema, Alex Brown, O'Connor and Gabriel. Next, another classic, Jingo, introduces King Sunny Ade, juju master of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wakafrika's comprehensive sleeve notes reveal that several of the featured artists are known to South African listeners. Souleymane Doumbia and Lasine Kouyate, for example, were the percussionist and balafonist who accompanied Salif Keita on his recent South African visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Pata Pata, lead vocals are sung by Kaissa Doumbe, who toured South Africa as part of Dibango's Soul Makossa Gang in 1993. Perhaps inspired by her South African visit, Doumbe sings and improvises the pata pata lines with a nouveau sweetness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other highlights include Amio, which features Kidjo and Papa Wemba, and an addition to the South African repertoire in the form of Wimoweh (Mbube), where Joseph Shabalala, Phiri, Dibango and friends rock gently over marimba and guitar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Homeless, O'Connor weaves the midnite lake alongside Zaire's Ray Lema, and South African/Malawian-born Phiri.  Known to us courtesy of Hugh Masekela's early 1980s recordings and frequent on-stage renditions, Lady, a funky and sensual Afrobeat song by Nigerian Fela Kuti, is also fronted by Phiri and O'Connor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The album concludes with the Soul Makossa Gang's live rendition of Dibango's oriental ,a Va Chouia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strings and brass build a menacing tension, only to be released when the bass starts running, guitars picking, horns scatting, and we're into a groove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The performance breaks down again to the menacing tension of Andre Manga's bass, and suddenly, high above the clouds, swathed in reverb, the trumpet of David Lewis catches its shaft of light, trading with the wah-wah guitar licks which snap rattlesnake-style with the snare.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC, December 6, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wole Soyinka was introduced by James O'Dea, Washington Director, Amnesty International USA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soyinka recounted the state of oppression in Nigeria, and ridiculed the denial by government of existence of political detainees. He reserved very harsh comments for Abacha as a &quot;man with no mind&quot;, a brutal person, and in a comparison drawing some guffaws commended Babangida of at least being &quot;a dictator with some civilization.&quot; He urged the international community to impose more isolating sanctions (economic, social, cultural and sports) on the Nigerian government, stating that the government had in any case already imposed sanctions on its own people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a Question and Answer session, he urged wide participation in the rally on the British Embassy, stating the British were dealing in arms with Nigeria, notwithstanding their claim that it was a private deal between a company named VICA (?) and the Nigerian government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daniel Suleiman (Commander retired) traced the birth of NADECO, their efforts at mobilizing the pro-democracy activities in Nigeria, the draconian measures used to suppress them, the press and the oil workers, and the need for many of them to flee their country in order to avoid detention and inhuman treatment, and carry on the struggle from safer grounds. He also urged the international community to impose sanctions on Nigeria to force a change in the human rights condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his Qestion and Answer session, he said he was proud of his participation as a military officer in a regime which as promised returned power to civilian rule, and all that he wanted was for his colleagues to have done the same. Several questions were asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Statement By Amnesty International USA: Deteriorating Human Rights Situation In Nigeria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Read by Adotei Akwei, at Wole Soyinka's Press Conference</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few countries can boast of having both a Nobel Prize winner, Wole Soyinka, and a Right Livelihood winner, Ken Saro-Wiwa. Fewer still have forced their Nobel laureate to flee the country to avoid arrest or have kept their Right Livelihood award winner in detention without charge. The fact that Nigeria has done both is indicative of its potential and the depth of the current crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past year the regime of General Sanni Abacha has banned over 15 newspapers and journals including the Concord, Punch and Guardian groups; arresting, detaining and harassing their staffs in addition to occupying their offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has arrested or detained hundreds of demonstrators including M.K.O.  Abiola, the man widely believed to have won last year's June presidential election, Ken Saro-Wiwa, who is also the President of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, retired Air Commodore Dan Suleiman, acting Chairman of NADECO, leading human rights activist Gani Fawehinmi, Dr. Beko Ransome Kuti and Liddum Mitee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also targeted for repression were the leaders of Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC), the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN). Following strikes and demonstrations in June and July the government arrested and dissolved the leadership, and then passed backdated decrees preventing any legal challenges to its actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Abacha's troops have regularly used excessive force, committed extrajudicial execution and have killed an estimated 200 protesters. No investigations have been made into the circumstances of the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Building on an already formidable web of repressive legislation, General Abacha has promulgated even more repressive decrees: Decree No. 11 of 1994 allows the Chief of General Staff and the Inspector General of Police to order detention without trial up to three months of anyone considered a threat to the security of the state. The decree also eliminated habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Decree No. 12 1994 blocks the ability of the Nigerian judiciary to challenge the government's actions or authority, solidifying the impunity already enjoyed in practice by the security forces and members of the government. The judiciary has also been undermined by the continued use of military tribunals whose record for due process has been questionable. The regime's contempt for the rule of law was displayed when it did not even bother to inform its Attorney-General of eight new decrees passed in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Rivers State in southeast Nigeria the government has escalated a campaign of repression being waged on the Ogoni people. The Ogoni have been protesting environmental damage from years of oil production as well as lack of adequate compensation, development and aid from the federal government.  Between May and June of 1994 at least 50 people were extrajudicially executed, an estimated 600 people detained or arrested and over 60 villages raided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International USA believes that the urgent crisis in Nigeria must be addressed by the international community. Any government that does not consider itself accountable to the rule of law domestically, (made clear by the failure to inform the former Attorney General about eight new decrees being passed) or internationally, (the seizure of Dr. Soyinka's UNESCO travel documents in November was a clear violation of international law) belie any claim it can make of returning the country to democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We call upon the United States and the international community to serve notice to the Abacha regime that merely professing a commitment to the rule of law and democracy will not suffice to return its relation with the international community to business as usual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Clinton must lead the international community and call for the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience and the prompt public investigations of all persons implicated in human rights violations in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> December 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. -- Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) and Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka today called on President Clinton to denounce the deteriorating human rights situation in Nigeria and urged him to lead the international community in applying pressure on the Nigeria's military regime to respect and protect human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wole Soyinka, Nobel Laureate in Literature, 1986, was forced to flee his homeland in mid-November following rumors that he was to be arrested by Nigerian military authorities. In September, his passport had been seized and his house placed under surveillance prior to a scheduled trip to Europe. A few weeks later, his travel documents from the United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for which he is a goodwill ambassador, were seized.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Nigerian government's treatment of Wole Soyinka underscores the arrogance with which they view Nigerian and international laws,&quot; said Adotei Adkwei, Program Officer for Sub-Saharan Africa, AIUSA, &quot;The United States must take preventive action now while the possibility exists to avoid a future disaster in Africa's most populace country. Given the genocide in Rwanda, the continuing disintegration of Somalia and the ongoing civil war in Liberia, the United States cannot afford to view Nigeria as solely an African issue only to be faced with containing the chaos' later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has arrested and detained hundreds of pro-democracy protesters, journalists, politicians, lawyers and trade unionists. Among those currently detained are M.K.O. Abiola, the projected winner of the presidential elections; Ken Saro-Wiwa, a prominent writer, President of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and recipient of the Right Livelihood Award (also known as the alternative Nobel Prize); Liddum Mittee, Vice-President of MOSOP Chief Anthony Enahoro, Vice-Chairman of Nadeco and a former minister in Nigeria's first independent government in 1960. Amnesty International considers these men to be Prisoners of Conscience, imprisoned solely for the non-violent expression of their political views and calls for their immediate and unconditional release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the last year the Abacha regime has banned over 15 newspapers and journals often occupying the premises of publications and arbitrarily detaining the employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In south east Nigeria, Oganiland, Amnesty International has documented a violent crackdown on the Ogoni people following their efforts to seek compensation for years of environmental pollution and inadequate development by the Nigerian government. The crackdown has included a pattern of extra judicial executions, arbitrary detentions and raids in over 60 villages mostly between May and June, 1994. Over the last year, the Nigerian authorities have prevented reporters or human rights organizations from visiting the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nigeria is a critical country both in practical as well as symbolic terms,&quot; said Akwei, &quot;The United States must now call on the Nigerian government to take measures to stop gross human rights violations before the current situation confronts the international community with a disaster felt across West Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa Faith and Justice Network (Washington, D.C.), December 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lack of peace in Liberia has nothing to do with peace conferences.  There have been at least 20 of them. It does not have to do with a lack of agreements, there have been at least 10 accords. So why has peace not come to Liberia yet? Ghana is trying to answer that question or can it? Akosombo Liberian warring factions and politicians have been in Ghana since November 12, 1994 at the invitation of President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana who is the current Chairman of the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) whose monitoring group, ECOMOG, has been in Liberia since 1990 trying to secure the peace. The meeting was adjourned on September 11, to resume on the 20 after negotiators had consulted with their followers and/or their warlord(s).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ghanaians are trying to rescue an accord reached in early September by three warring factions: the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), harbinger of the war, Armed Forces of Liberia, (AFL)- supposedly the national army - and the United Liberia Movement for Democracy (ULIMO). The Akosombo Accord, as the treaty is known, was rejected by Liberian politicians who were in attendance at the Liberian National Conference in Monrovia as well as Liberian journalists. Their opposition to Akosombo stemmed from the interpretation that the Accord was rewarding individuals who are particularly responsible for the lack of progress in the implementation of the Cotonou Accord signed in July 1993 in Benin (more about Cotonou later).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is more, the three groups, which were party to the latest accord, have serious internal divisions impaired by wanton violence. There are two ULIMOs: one wing led by Alhadji Kromah, who was one of the signatories to Akosombo and the other wing headed by Roosevelt Johnson, who, although represented at Akosombo, did not sign on to the agreement. The territories in Liberia to which ULIMO has claim are controlled by Johnson's ULIMO while Mr.  Kromah, is believed to be resident in Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Charles Taylor, head of the NPFL and another signatory to the accord, has immense problems keeping his group together. Three of his highest profiled representatives in the Liberia National Transitional Government (LNTG), which was set up as a result of the Cotonou Accord have all parted company with him. Not only have they &quot;ousted&quot; him from the group, they are now party to something called &quot;the coalition forces&quot; who are battling remnants of Taylor's NPFL soldiers for control of Gbarnga, the provisional headquarters of the NPFL. Mr. Taylor has not been able to return to Gbarnga since he went to Ghana in early September. Even though Mr. Taylor has publicly stated that he would be taking Gbarnga back &quot;soon;&quot; two months have gone by and Gbarnga continues to be a &quot;no man's land.&quot; Taylor's last known destination was Burkina Faso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AFL has its hands full. Almost all of the warring factions, perhaps, except for the NPFL, have fighters in their ranks who are members of the AFL. On September 15, former AFL Commanding General, the notorious Charles Julu (who left Worcester, Massachusetts, USA a day earlier) attempted to overthrow the LNTG with the help of 100 members of the AFL. The attempt was foiled by ECOMOG. Julu now awaits trial for &quot;treason&quot; in Monrovia.  Following the foiled coup, 1000 members of the AFL were disarmed by ECOMOG. A few weeks thereafter, LNTG head, David Kpomakpor, sacked Hezekiah Bowen from his position as Chief of Staff of the AFL. Bowen was the one who signed in behalf of the AFL at Akosombo. Bowen's immediate deputy was promoted to replace him. Though dismissed, Bowen continues to be considered, by ECOWAS and himself, as the head of the AFL. Bowen's invitation to Ghana and his apparent refusal to step down, exemplified the rampant confusion characterizing the current Liberia peace process. Who is who; who represents who and/or what constitute the million dollar questions, a solution to the Liberian crisis will have to address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Akosombo Once Ghana was impressed by Liberian politicians that it would not accept Akosombo I, a high level Ghanaian delegation visited Monrovia on September 9 and held talks with members of Liberia's political class, especially those involved with the Liberia National Conference. The talks did not produce any tangible result. Liberian politicians including, former President of the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU), Amos Sawyer, the Chairman and Chief Organizer of the Liberia National Conference, a civilian member of the LNTG as well as Taylor appointee on the LNTG were in turn invited to Accra the following week. Again, no agreement was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, following the mid September Ghana meeting, participants of the National Conference in Monrovia, tempered their opposition to the Akosombo Accord. At the conclusion of the Conference in early October, it was hinted that with some modifications, Akosombo may become acceptable to the Liberian political class. It is also not very clear who the Liberian political class really represents either. They have not created any medium through which ordinary Liberians would contribute to the peace process.  Liberian refugees, who number over a million have no way of impacting the talks. Only &quot;recognized&quot; politicians or their groups received invitations to the Ghana talks. Certainly, the Liberia National Conference is the largest assembly of Liberians since the civil war. About 1000 Liberians reportedly participated in the Conference. Its composition nonetheless does not differ from the one which met in March-April 1991. At that time it was largely the same &quot;recognized&quot; groups and individuals who were invited. This time around, the number have increased, obviously in response to the increased number of warring factions - the more the warriors, the more the urban politicians. In April 1991 there were only two warring factions. Now there are seven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is against this background that the warring factions and politicians met in Ghana &quot;to fine tune&quot; the agreement according to Ghana's Foreign Minister, who is co-chairing the talks along with his Nigerian counterpart. On November 6, following a meeting with the two Foreign Ministers, the three signatories to Akosombo I: NPFL's Taylor, ULIMO's Kromah and AFL's Bowen, issued a joint statement in which they pledged allegiance to the terms of Akosombo I and called on Ghana to install within &quot;10 days&quot; a new transitional Government. Ghanaian authorities differ and are pressuring the Liberian political class to accept a modified version of the treaty. Ghana expresses hope that with some adjustments, Akosombo II may provide a workable framework for resolving the Liberian crisis. Liberians can only wait and hope that this becomes the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Revisiting Cotonou--The Cotonou Accord is the current peace treaty in force. It transpired on September 7. Cotonou had a life span of six months.  During that period it should have achieved disarmament, repatriation and democratic elections. It achieved none of those. Akosombo I hoped to have had that corrected. It nevertheless underestimated or chose to ignore the prevailing circumstances (as stated above) in the country. This is especially the case because renewed fighting had engulfed central and southeastern Liberia, producing new refugees and displaced persons. 200,000 Liberian refugees are believed to have fled to Cote d'Ivoire since September. An additional 50,000 Liberians, mostly from southeastern Liberia are displaced in Buchanan during the same period according to United Nations' sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result of the fighting, all relief groups in central and southeastern Liberia have withdrawn. heir withdrawal was precipitated by the kidnapping of relief workers, the looting of relief supplies, the carjacking of relief vehicles; and the outright capriciousness shown by the warring factions. Of greater concern is the partial withdrawal by Nigeria of some of its troops in Liberia; about 4000 of them have been withdrawn &quot;due to lack of logistics.&quot; Furthermore, the United Nations has reduced its monitors from 368 to a mere 90 . This has put into jeopardy the lives of thousands of Liberians who were dependent on these agencies for their survival. Several hundred Liberian children are now facing starvation or suffering from malnutrition.  The conditions of displaced Liberians has only gotten more precarious; with a threatening cholera epidemic. All of these are the direct results of the activities of the various warlords without exception. It is with them however, that the burden of bringing peace to Liberia rests; will and can they do so on their own?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conclusion--At a time when Liberians need the international community most, it seems to be shirking its obligation to the people of that war-scarred country. U.N. Secretary General clearly stated this view by observing that &quot;with regard to the Trust Fund for the Implementation of the Cotonou Agreement on Liberia, as at 10 October 1994, voluntary contributions received amounted to $17.8 million...&quot; The Trust Fund, whose target was $160 million, was launched two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cash-strapped Nigerians have been forced to cut back their troop strength. Ugandan President Museveni has promised to keep his troops in Liberia; maybe Tanzania will do similarly. Ghana threatened to bring home its troops by December if the warring factions do not disarm by then. Ghana, which has the second largest number of troops in the country, may change their position depending on the outcome of Akosombo II. Liberia is in competition with so many other crises in Africa for international attention.  With the lack of Western media attention, Liberia appears to be kept on the back burner of Western policy makers. Time could not be any bleaker for Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberians need the help of the international community, especially the West, to end its crisis. Preliminary steps to achieve this will have to include a ceasefire by the warring factions and guarantees for the safety of relief workers. This will enable relief workers to gain access to displaced persons. For another accord to have serious impact, it would require significant diplomatic and financial assistance from western countries particularly the United States of America. It should be stated unambiguously as a caveat, that any party which presents obstacle(s) to the implementation of the agreement will be severely censured. The time for peace in Liberia is now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, December 15, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democracy is finding its root in country after country. There is concrete proof that economic discipline and modernization will yield growth.  There are encouraging signs that subregional organizations--ECOWAS in Liberia, IGADD in Sudan, and SADC in Angola, Mozamibque and Lesotho-- are searching for new ways to address the calamitous conflicts in their areas. I might add that it is important that there is a longing for stability among so many-- people tired of civil wars, exhausted by disasters man-made and natural, desperate and determined to pass on a better life to their children.  It is a desire that Africans share with people all over the world-- from the Middle East to Northern Ireland to Central America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while we recognize these signs of hope, we know--as you know-- that many Africannations are but one step away from crisis. And at such an important and potentially difficult moment, caring means not only acting, but also that it is necessary for Africa's friends to speak the truth as we see it. Not to condemn and not to distance ourselves from Africa's problems, but as part of our commitment to help resolve them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the signs of progress, the truth in stark. African nations must reverse the economic slide of the so-called &quot;lost decade of the 1980s&quot; that has left their people, for the most part, poorer, less educated, less healthy and with fewer prospects for better lives than they had almost a generation ago. Even the countries that are making progress are threatened by instability in their regions. Sixteen African nations are involved in some form of civil conflict: six million refugees and 17 million displaced persons put an intolerable strain on resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In countries like the United States, those of us who recognize the importance of continued active engagement and support for Africa are confronting the reality of shrinking resources and an honest skepticism about the return on our investments in peacekeeping and development. The world around Africa is fast coming together, and this continent risks becoming the odd man out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let me illustrate what I mean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have come to Addis after six weeks with President Clinton that has taken us around the world. We traveled to six nations in the Middle East and witnessed the signing of a peace treaty between Israel and Jordon. In Budapest, at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, President Clinton marked an historic occasion as three nations of the former Soviet Union agreed to dismantle their nuclear weapons. In Jakart, the President helped lead 17 Asian-Pacific governments to agreement on creating a free trade zone by the year 2020. In Miami last weekend, he led the nations of the Western Hemisphere as they agreed to create an agreement for a Free Trade of the Americas by 2005. And at home, he secured the passage by our Congress of the General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are tremendous accomplishments, events that would have been unimaginable even a decade ago. I catalogue them for you because I believe that-- despite their different goals-- they all send a clear message: each of these regions is coming together politically and, especially, economically.  And they are doing so in the context of the global GATT agreement. Unless African nations can resolve their internal problems so that they can come together in similar fashion. Africa could be left outside the new globla marketplace, and that would be a tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of this is probably due to economic and environmental mismanagement. But it is also a fact that those responsible for the murderous conflicts that plague the continent are doing more that slaughtering so many of this generation with bullets and machetes; they are also killing the hope of future generations to find a more prosperous life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Too many African nations are caught in a vicious cycle. Bloody civil wars and deadly ethnic conflicts make political stability impossible. Without political stability there can be little economic development. And economic and environmental decay, in turn, generate the conditions for these explosive civil wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Breaking this cycle is no easy task. But one thing is clear: African governments and international community together must shift their focus from reacting to crises and dealing with the human consequences to their prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Clinton's Horn of Africa initiative seeks to identity and address the root causes of hunger and famine in ten nations before they can erupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currently, the United States spends twice as much on disaster relief as it does on development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have begun talks with African governments and donors to fashion an approach that changes this trend, that goes beyond disaster relief to try to intergrate our relief and development efforts. That approach would involve regional cooperation among affected nations, improved donor collaboration, and- very important- strengthened early warning systems to account for social and political trends in addition to climatic changes. The initiative will put African governments at the center of an alliance among donor governments, private groups and the countries in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The goal is to launch a three-part program. Our first focus combines traditional relief techniques and new technology to prevent immediate threats of famine by propositioning food, so that Africans and the international community can react quickly to Famine Early Warning System reports. In turn, we will work with local governments and populations to advance programs necessary for recovery from such crises: increasing agricultural production, repairing and building roads and dams, and launching projects to prevent soil erosion. And third, and this is most important, we will also address such long term challenges as overpopulation, the role of women, and environmental decay. Working with other donors and international institutions and drawing on our allocated relief resources, we hope that up to $1 billion can be identified by the international community for these vital activities, and we're going to work onthis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regional cooperation will help begin to break the grip of famine. It can also help African natios to solve one of the major man-made causes of these disasters: ethnic conflicts and civil wars. Controlling and preventing these outbreaks is in every African nation's self-interest. But the United States can also help support these efforts, for it is in our interest too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the wake of long and terrible conflicts, many countries are faced witht he dilemma of what to do with the former cobatants. Nations like Ethiopia, and others, have taken strong steps to demobilize their forces, in an effort to promote stability by helping them move smoothly and quickly into productive civilian jobs. Demobilization frees up resources better spent on schools, health clinics and development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Different nations have used different techniques from cash payments for soldiers to providing funds for transport home or job training. The results have been dramatic. By next year, Uganda will have cut its 80,000-man army by half; each soldier receives $1000 for materials to build homes, purchase medical care and provide transport for himself and his family. And in Mozmbique, the combined forces of 110,000 warring armies have already been reduced to less than 15,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the past two years the United States has allocated some $40 million for dembilization this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States also supports the goal of the eentual elimination fo land mines everywhere. Towards that goal, we are supporting programs aimed at comprehensive steps to remove landmines throughout Africa. At the United Nations this year, President Clinton announced our intention to seek unprecedented controls ont he export and use of landmines. Africa is the world's most heavily mined region, with as many as 30 million mines in 18 countries-- out fo an estimated 100 million worldwide. In Angola alone, there's more than one landmine for each of its nearly 10 million citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to our program in Angola, this year we are supporting efforts to clear mines and train people to recognize, avoid and report landmines in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Mozambique, Namibia and Rwanda. Removing these mines is not only important for humanitarian purposes, but can be key to economic recovery in nations after long years of war and slowed agricultural production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, the United States has committed $1.5 million to support the OAU's conflict resolution program begun by Secretary Genereal Salim. We want to help you redouble your efforts to prevent conflict and enhance your peacekeeping activities, as you have done int he recent mission that sent human rights monitors to Burundi. And two weels ago we were pleased to welcome Doctor Chris Bakwesegha, chief of your conflict resolution division, when he visited the U.S. to tour a number of facilities,including the Pentagon's national military commander center. We are encouraged by his plan to create an effective operations center here in Addis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let me emphasize: the Clinton Administration stands with you and with everyone on the front lines of the struggle for Africa's future. But securing these resources and supporting these programs is not getting any easier. The problems are apparent: shrinking budgets that could maean stagnant levels of aid. An American people devating where and when to get involved abroad. A United Nations stretched to its capacities. We are commited to remaining engaged-- but we must recognize how hard the road ahead of all of us will be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the best of times, all that the outside world can offer nations in crisis is &quot;window of opportunity&quot; in which they can sort out their problems during a period of relative security. The international community can offer support; it cannot be a savior. Outsiders have neither the power or the right to dictate solutions for the nations of Africa or any other region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, when the times are getting tougher, we face a new reality. In Africa and elsewhere, the windows of opportunity can remain open for only so long. And every time the leaders of contending factions do not seize that opportunity, do not act before the window slams shut, they will not only hurt the citizens of their countries, they may also diminish the will of the international community to offer such support elsewhere in other conflicts and crises on the continent. So it will be harder-- not impossible, but harder-- o count on the international community ot heal the wounds of these wars. The warlords -- and, tragically, their peoples-- cannot always count on an international safety net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ultimately Africa's leaders and it's people are responsible for their actions; they have it within their power to settle their differences. And we need look no further than southern Africa, to Mozambique, for encouraging evidence taht when leaders decide to put the future of their nations ahead of their immediate ambitions, and use democracy to settle their differences,they can rightfully claim the gratitude of their people and the applause of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent months we have seen how in both Lesotho and Mozambique neighboring states can help prevent such conflicts. And across Africa, there is a new generation of leaders, like President Meles in Ethiopia, many of whom have come to power since the end of the Cold War. These leaders have discarded the ideological baggage of the end of the Cold War. They have gone beyond the heady era of independence and the subsequent period of blaming everything on their colonial legacies. They recognize the deadly potential of ethnic rivalries, AIDS, environmental degradation. And they are ready to measure their progress on a different scale: instituting economic policies that promote sustainable development,building responsive governments that give citizens a stake in the future, and creating civil societies in which freedom flourishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is why, despite the dangers and the difficulties that I have just outlined. President Clinton and his Administration reject Afro-pessimism. But neither should any of us seek refuge in the illusions of Afro-optimism.  Friends of Africa who suggest these challenges will be easily met are not doing any of us a favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is needed, I think, instead is a new Afro-realism. An Afro-realism that commits us to the hard work that can strenghten the partnership between Africa and America. For without the partnership, Africa will have lost the support we wish to give and are determined to give. And America will have lost the opportunity to participate in what could be--what must be--one of the great adventures of our time: fulfilling the dreams of Africa's greatness that animated the leaders of its independence so many years ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the first time, Nigerian women are becoming directly involved in the formation of political associations. In the past one week, two political associations headed by women have emerged. The first one is the Republican Movement of Nigeria, RMN, which is headed by Oliviah Agbajoh, a lawyer and former member of the Federal House of Representatives in the Second Republic.  She told &quot;Newswatch&quot; last week that when the ban on formation of political parties is finally lifted, the movement would transform into the Republican Party of Nigeria, RPN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party, she said, would have as its focus the liberation of all oppressed Nigerians especially women and children. She argued that although women and children constitute a greater percentage of Nigeria, successive governments have neglected them. She accused Sani Abacha, the head of state of refusing to include women in his government, adding, &quot;it is not only people in oil producing communities who are marginalised. Many people including the poor and defenseless women and children are suffering. So our aim would be to liberate them.&quot; She explained that her role in the formation of the political association is to ensure equal participation for all Nigerians in the democratisation process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A second political association, the One Nigeria Forum is said to be lead by Sara Jubril, former presidential aspirant of the proscribed Social Democratic Party, SDP. Although she refused to sign the pamphlet announcing the formation of the political association, she was said to have been involved in it formation. The association which may also transform into a political party is said to be aimed at healing the wounds created by political differences which have torn the country apart in the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already, the two groups are said to be recruiting members from all parts of the country. Said Agbajoh: &quot;Our target is to reach everybody in this country, to spread our message of liberation, our message of national regeneration. I am sure that our messages will appeal to millions of Nigerians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt that these political moves by the women was encouraged by a two-day national workshop on the participation of women in politics and national development organised by the National Council of Women Societies, NCWS. At the workshop, the NCWS urged women to seek elective offices without compromising their family and societal obligations. The council also suggested that there should be no party exclusively for women or women's wings' in political parties, saying &quot;women should be involved in the process of party formation and in the highest decision-making organs of parties.&quot; A non-partisan trust fund is to be set up to provide support for any duly nominated female candidate. This will provide female politicians strong financial base with which to fight for elective positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A similar workshop organised by the NCWS media forum to sensitise Nigerian journalist on the coverage of international conferences was also held in Lagos. Speakers at the workshop agreed on the need to promote women's positive contributions to society. Tom Adaba who represented Jerry Gana, minister of information, said Nigerian media women should strive to &quot;re-affirm women's wisdom and knowledge by way of encouraging dialogue and debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another speaker, Janet Badjan-Young, the director of United Nations Information Centre in Nigeria said women in the media should &quot;promote issues like gender equality and highlight harmful cultural practices like teenage marriage, violence against women, denial of education to females and dumping of female babies in pit latrines.&quot; According to her, this could be done by providing education on health issues and career options. Badjan-Young said the media role of advocacy is equally important. Women in the media she said, &quot;must be the voice of the voiceless, must protect women's interests, aspirations and visions by making government and international organisations responsive to women's issues and advancement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from generating a new spirit of determination and commitment to the advancement of women, the workshops were a part of preparation for the conferences on women in Dakar Senegal and Beijing China.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's new parliament has more women than ever beforee, but as the first session drew to a close a fortnight ago, women MPs agreed it still was not a &quot;woman-friendly&quot; place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a start, when the new MPs arrived in May, they found there were hardly any women's toilets.There was a billiard room, but no childcare facilities, and the two gyms were used exclusively by men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parliament's walls were full of portraits of white men. The only woman sharing the place with them was Helen Suzman of the Progressive Federal Party (PFP), But some things have started to change. A creche was set up, women's toilets put in on every floor, and a gym given over to women members.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is probably the first time any parliament in the world has had an ad-hoc committee dealing with children,&quot; said ANC MP Yvette Myakayaka. But ANC MP Baleka Kgositsile said: &quot;Men have their own world and their own way of networking in parliament that is not sensitive to women. So issues affecting more than half of the population, like sexual harassment and rape, tend not become policy matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC MP Zoe Kota said it also meant: &quot;Because a person is a woman, she has to prove herself three times in order to be seen to be doing something in parliament.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women have also complained about the persistent jeering in sessions though by men from the former liberation movements, in which this was not common, have found it just as alienating. In addition, working hours are awkward for women with families to take care of. Senate and National Assembly sessions can go on until 8 pm, said PAC MP Patricia de Lile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nightmare</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My personal experience has been a nightmare,&quot; said ANC MP Baleka Kgositsile. She is a single parent with five children in Johannesburg and finds the time she has to spend in Cape Town disruptive and financially demanding. &quot;It is even more difficult for women whose husbands have not reached a level of political maturity where they cannot accept that their wives are MPs,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They face tensions in their marriages, while at the same time trying to settle down in Cape Town and set up second homes.&quot; But despite the obstacles, there have been victories, starting with Frene Ginwala's appointment as Speaker of the National Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women also chair committees, head study groups, are whips and play an important role in caucuses, though they are still under-represented at the highest level of government. There are 17 ministries, but only two are women and three deputy ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need to ensure that the criteria of non-sexism is taken as seriously as the non-racist one when appointments are made, &quot; said Kgositsile. Nevertheless, women made themselves heard on some key issues in this session. The Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) white paper took on board women's concerns by including free medical facilities for pregnant women and children under six, free schooling for the first 10 years and school feeding schemes, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the real test would be in its implementation, said Myakayaka.  Women would have to be involved in the local government and non-governmental structures which would be responsible for delivery if they were going to benefit from the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision by the President's office to have a special desk to deal with women's issues was a set in the right decision, De Lille said. The passing of the Land Restitution Bill was also a victory for women, Myakayaka pointed out. A large number of rural families were headed by women, who often bore the brunt of forced removals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, committees were set up to look into the questions of unequal taxation, abortion and sterilisation and the establishment of a commission on gender equality to advise the government on legislation and policy. The commission is provided for in the interim constitution but women are concerned that it should not become a ghetto on gender issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our experience of Codesa was that gender issues were put to advisory committees. That meant policy making continued while gender issues were pushed aside,&quot; explained Kota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women have also managed to organise themselves both within their parties and across party-political lines. A multi-party women's caucus meets weekly to try and reach consensus on issues that affect them across the board and to provide support to its members. many of whom have been in full time politics before. The organisation is still in its infancy without even an office or a co-ordinator but successfully rallied women around the issue of making International Women's Day on August 9 as a national holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have also been workshops on speech writing and delivery, for example, as well as visits overseas to give women a chance to se how other parliaments function. &quot;We have established a good rapport and the contact between different women is very good and better than among men,&quot; Myakayaka said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFP MP Faith Gas agreed. &quot;Some IFP women were a bit cautious about working with ANC women but the more they went to caucus the happier they got,&quot; she said. The challenge will be to maintain that unity when the more controversial issues like abortion and sterilisation are raised in the next session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The caucus also needs to organise itself to screen legislation, Kota said. Most MPs do not have the support of research assistants or secretaries and individuals have not had the time to scrutinise every piece of legislation that has been through parliament for its impact on women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the caucus needs to make contact with women's organisations outside parliament. &quot;Until now, we have not been speaking with a mandate,&quot; explained Kota. So the issues prioritised by MPs might not be the issues that women outside parliament considered most important.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;African football has come of age,&quot; says Adegboye Onigbinde, former Super Eagles coach and Confederation of African Football, CAF, technical committee member. He was reacting to FIFA's decision to give Africa two additional slots at the 1998 World Cup. Fanny Amu, Flying Eagles coach and Joseph Ladipo, a.k.a. Jossy Lad, also a coach, expressed the same view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Winning two more slots for Africa was a major victory for Issa Hayatou, CAF president. He convinced Joao Havalenge, FIFA president, to concede to Africa five of the 32 slots for the 1998 world cup finals in France. Hayatou had been campaigning for two additional slots for Africa since the 32 team format was proposed in 1990. &quot;We had to fight hard to get this,&quot; Hayatoud said in New York.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The battle was not won easily. Before the last World Cup, USA '94, in which Africa had three representatives-Nigeria, Cameroon and Morocco-the continent had two representatives. Cameroon's spectacular performance at Italy '90 changed that and FIFA decided to give Africa one more place. That extra place was taken from Europe. This time around, however, there was some politiking. Havalenge's sixth term as FIFA president was partly made possible by Hayatou's withdrawal from succession contest. CAF had put forward Hayatou mid-way into Havalenge's fifth term. A lot of work was also done by CAF to ensure the African representative's success. At a stage, Sepp Blatter, FIFA secretary-general, told the press that an African was likely to succeed Havalenge. But towards the end of Havalenge's fifth term, the Brazilian called Hayatou for a dialogue in order to win one more term. Hayatou agreed.  At the FIFA congress during the USA '94 draws, Havalenge was returned unopposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Africa's gain was a loss for other continents. Europe, lobbied for 15 places but was given 14. It had 13. South America for one more to make it five. Confederation of American Football, CONCACAF, also received one more place. It now has three. Asia, wanted four places but was given only one more making them three but of four team option. The continent's fourth qualifier will play a qualifying match with the winner of Oceania which has none or one option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blatter said, &quot;there was no real problem. Only the Asians who would have liked four guaranteed places were a bit unhappy.&quot; Lent Johannson, Union of European Football Association, UEFA, president said that Europe's two extra slots &quot;made a lot of sense. We could have argued for another place but we have respect for the others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Asians are unhappy because FIFA did not take the performance of its representatives, South Korea and Saudi Arabia, at USA '94 into consideration. Though South Korea lost out in the preliminaries, it gave a good account of the improvement that Asian football has gone through in the last four years. They drew 2-2 with Spain and 0-0 with Bolivia, only to lose in their best match of the tournament to Germany. 2-3. Saudi Arabia went as far as the second round and they lost to Sweden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If that argument were tenable, Europe and South America might as well have taken all the world cup places available. At the last World Cup, three of the semifinalists were from Europe- Italy, Bulgaria, and Romania. The other semifinalist was Brazil from South America. South American countries Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay have won the World Cup eight times. Brazil won the Jules Rimet trophy for keeps in 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, FIFA's other consideration was the number of football associations each region has registered with it. FIFA has 178 members comprising Europe with 49, Africa 48, Asia 36, CONCACAF 27, South America 10, and Oceania 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the 32 team format, the cumbersome and unjustifiable process of picking the four best third-placed teams after world cup finals preliminary match will be eliminated. Although FIFA feels it has taken a right decision, the body will wait to see the performance of each zone before it puts its seal on the format.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This perhaps, is where CAF might run into problems. Hayatou's plans is to employ FIFA's method for seeding countries based on the strength of the teams. But some African countries are already lobbying CAF to pick a team each from each of the five regions of Africa. These are West, East, South, North and Central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Segun Odegbami, former Eagles captain and head of marketing committee of the NFA was afraid this could happen. He advised that FIFA should grant only four places to Africa. Odegbami argues that &quot;countries with weak teams show want to go to the world cup at all cost out number those with strong teams. They could take the situation out of CAF's control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Onigbinde thinks Odegbami's fears are misplaced. He told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that Africa had been divided into six operational zones by CAF. There are two each in the West and North and one in the South/Central and East Africa Hayatou himself is sure the CAF will adopt a system which will guarantee that the best five teams in Africa are picked. He says he recognises that West Africa has three strong reams and that it the three qualify for the world cup, no one would query CAF's decision. &quot;The system of the best will be used in selecting qualifiers,&quot; Hayatou said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the demise of South Africa's apartheid system, the whole Southern African region stands at the threshold of a new era promising greater economic co-operation and integration, observes the African Development Bank (ADB).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the new opportunities for expanded trade and mutually beneficial exchanges &quot;must be seized before the moment passes,&quot; the ADB warns in a study called &quot;Economic Integration in Southern Africa&quot; published in the latest edition of the United Nations' quarterly publication, African Recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surveying the likely impact of the large South African economy on the rest of Southern Africa, the study stressed that development and growth must be more balanced than in the past.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The clear lesson,&quot; says ADB President Babacar Ndiaye, &quot;is that for the region's overall welfare gain to be distributed among countries more equitably than the market would by itself achieve, a regional policy will be required that would ensure that all countries register net gain as a result of co-operation and progressive integration&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ndiaye asserts that for such an equitable economic integration to succeed, a &quot;pre-occupation with trade liberalisation&quot; by itself insufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There must also be a corresponding &quot;priority to investment in production to expand productive capacity in all sectors and to build the necessary infrastructure&quot;. This approach, he says, marks a &quot;fundamental departure&quot; from past attempts at African economic integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he study stresses that integration of the wider Southern region must proceed incrementally, beginning with the &quot;core group of countries: the 10 countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), plus South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Improving co-ordination with Kenya, Zimbabwe or other nearby countries may be vital in certain economic sectors, but involving all 20 members of the wider Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern African (TPA) at this point &quot;would be fraught with severe practical problems&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Bilateral&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, it is important to begin now to rationalise the overlapping and sometimes competing regional institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides SADC and PTA, there are the Southern African Customs Union (Sacu), the Southern African Multilateral Monetary Area and other subsidiary bodies and bilateral agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The study concludes that the basis already established by SADC for project and sector coordination should provide the &quot;main focus&quot; for integration efforts and that SADC should be careful not to dissipate its efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SADC will have its hands full simply concentrating on the task of co-ordinating investments in key sectors and engaging South Africa in the region's development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, &quot;the PTA should continue as the agenda-setting authority on trade liberalisation and the evolution of a common market,&quot; in light of the hopes for an &quot;eventual enlargement&quot; of sub-regional groupings into a broader continent-wide community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The study's institutional recommendations reflect its view t hat the route to economic integration in Southern Africa will need to proceed along two parallel and connected tracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first is sector co-ordination and co-operation on project investment and policy harmonisation. Progress along this track should begin immediately, the study says, and &quot;co-ordination in each sector should proceed as fast as circumstances within the sector allow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second track, market integration, will involve reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers to intraregional trade.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington Notes on Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fall 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African countries, whose representatives played little role in the complex and secretive negotiations, are likely to be particularly big losers.  A recent OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) study of GATT's effects predicted that by the year 2002 the rest of the world will be gaining annual benefits of $216 billion while Sub-Saharan Africa will be suffering losses of $2.6 billion a year. This loss, argued the study, could be offset by an increase in aid to the continent. But given the trend towards diminished aid, this seems unlikely.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In theory, GATT should open up opportunities for developing countries, including Africa, to sell more to the developed world. There will likely be gains in some sectors, such as for African sugar exporters. Eventually African textile exports might benefit, although most tariff cuts for textile imports by developed countries will not fall until 2005. The negative effects will be more substantial, while Africa's leverage to gain exceptions will remain far less than that of more powerful actors in the world economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most significant losses will come from erosion of quotas and preferences for Africa under the Lome agreements with Europe. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), a loophole allowing special treatment for developing countries, will also be more restricted under the new GATT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traditional African exports of tropical products will thus suffer.  There will be increasing restrictions on African governments' options for subsidizing farmers and restricting food imports to achieve food security.  While theoretically GATT exempts the least developed countries from having to remove their agricultural import barriers, it will intensify pressures in that direction already at work in most structural adjustment programs instituted by the World Bank and IMF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gains from GATT will tend to accrue to larger farmers and multinational agricultural companies already engaging in production for export. Food security, however, is better promoted through increasing and diversifying production for the domestic market and promoting regional trade between African countries. Both these goals will be more difficult to pursue under GATT guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More generally, GATT will promote deeper penetration of African economies by foreign interests. A requirement to treat foreign companies in the same way as domestic ones will override the ability of governments to have a say, for example, in requiring majority domestic ownership of joint ventures. The net effect will be to reduce the options for protecting vulnerable local markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new World Trade Organization, to be set up as a result of the GATT agreement, will be a highly undemocratic body, removing decisions even further from input by grassroots interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES (GSP)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A related issue which will be on the Congressional agenda is renewal of the GSP, currently the most important mechanism regulating trade between the U.S. and developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When GATT began thirty years ago, participating countries were required to implement reciprocal reductions in trade barriers, and treat all countries equally. Developing nations, however, said such requirements hindered their ability to increase export earnings and reduce their dependence on foreign aid. The requirements were then modified to exempt developing countries from the reciprocity requirement, and to allow developed countries to grant preferential treatment to developing countries. Although this mechanism has provided limited benefits to date, it provides a framework for advocating measures to increase Africa's trade earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1974 the U.S. passed legislation implementing the GSP, with the stated goals of helping developing countries industrialize, reduce their dependence on primary commodities and increase expand manufacturing.  Specifically, the GSP:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1) authorizes the President to allow eligible articles into the U.S.  market duty-free;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2) forbids the President from designating certain items as eligible articles, specifically textile and apparel articles subject to textile agreements, electronic products, steel products, most leather products, glass products, and some others;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3) places limits on the amount of each article which may be imported;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4) sets criteria which countries must meet before being eligible for GSP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With all these qualifications, according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute, only 14 percent of all imports to the U.S. from developing countries enjoy GSP treatment. Less than one tenth of one percent of GSP benefits go to the forty least developed countries, most in Sub-Saharan Africa. GSP thus currently translates into few gains for African countries. In fact, it tends to benefit countries such as South Korea which already have manufacturing capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the eligible articles which enjoy GSP treatment are not agricultural products, which are generally considered sensitive to the U.S.  economy. Overall, less than 10 percent of U.S. imports from least-developed African beneficiaries of GSP receive GSP treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year Congress, at the administration's request, reauthorized GSP for one year only. Next year the administration is expected to propose a ten-year renewal. The one-year renewal reduces total GSP benefits slightly, while giving the President more discretionary authority to review tariff schedules and grant GSP status to additional commodities not considered &quot;import-sensitive,&quot; including steel, electronics and glass. Virtually no least-developed country, however, has the capacity to export these products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Advocates of GSP reform argue that GSP unnecessarily excludes from coverage many products of export interest to Africa's least-developed countries. Their export volumes are unlikely to be large enough to have &quot;import-sensitive&quot; effects for U.S. producers. For this group of countries, all products should be eligible for consideration for GSP status, and the decision should be made on the basis of the potential contribution to sustainable development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In new GSP legislation, moreover, the objectives need to be clearly focused on environmentally sustainable development and diversification of exports by developing countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The year 1993, on the whole, was a difficult one for the economies of African countries. So says The World Bank Annual Report 1994. The Gross Domestic Product, GDP, for the continent, excluding South Africa, grew by just 1.4 percent. &quot;Although this represents an improvement over 1992, it is nonetheless disappointing considering the region's high rate of population growth and the level needed for development,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As in previous years, according to the report, the countries implementing major economic reforms and, therefore, benefiting from the Special Programme of Assistance, SPA, saw their aggregate output increase by 2.1 percent, or more than the average for the region. The SPA for low-income, debt-distressed sub-Saharan African countries provides quick-disbursing balance-of-payments assistance to 29 eligible countries (as at the end of June 1994) in support of reform programmes developed in conjunction with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, IMF. The 16 core or steady reformers did still better as their GDP rose by 2.8 percent. The countries comprising the CFA zone, however, saw their economies contract for the third consecutive year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A positive development in 1993, according to the World Bank, was that, on the average, the low-income countries performed better than the middle-income ones, although, neither group recorded an increase in per capita terms. Some of the highest rates were achieved by those countries such as Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia that were recovering from the severe drought of 1991/92. The report attributes the &quot;rather quick recovery&quot; of these and other countries from the effects of the drought to &quot;the relative resilience of their economies and to the effectiveness of collaboration among their public administrations, donors, and non-governmental organisations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were sharp contrasts in the performance of the economies of African countries last year, due to the contradictory forces at play not just across countries but within them and even within sectors. For instance, such countries as The Gambia, Sierra Leone, and Zimbabwe, where the implementation of reform programmes is on track, experienced low GDP growth rates due to the deterioration of their terms of trade (low prices of their exports), weather conditions, the lingering effects of the 1991-92 drought, or the disruptions caused by rebel activity and political transition. In contrast, other countries such as Equatorial Guinea and Sudan where reform programmes were lacking or off-track, registered growth of six to seven percent, made possible by oil exports or favourable agricultural conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite these variations, the events of the past year have some common elements which, to the World Bank, &quot;provide encouraging signs for the future.&quot; One of them is the fact that democratisation process in the continent is still moving ahead despite delays and costs in terms of lives and physical assets. The other is that reform programmes have survived in most countries and have even been strengthened in others despite economic and political hardships. &quot;Several countries improved their performance in the course of the past year, and the members of the CFA zone have taken an historic, bold step to improve their competitiveness. While much remains to be done, more countries are embarking on reform programmes and face better prospects compared with a year ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apparently in response to criticisms of economic adjustment programmes recommended and supervised by it, the World Bank, in the report, gave specific comparative instances to prove that African countries that have sustained such programmes generally have performed better than those that have not. The observation is based on a recent study by the bank staff covering 29 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for the 1981-91 period. According to their findings, the six countries with the greatest success in eliminating macro-economic imbalances enjoyed the strongest resurgence in economic performance, experiencing a median increase of almost two percent points in the growth rate of GDP per person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The experiences of Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda were cited to demonstrate respectively, the effects on the economy of a disrupted political transition programme, disrupted by re-introduced economic reforms and a steady implementation of reforms. Nigeria went through a tumultuous period in both 1992 and 1993 with the planned democratic transition getting protracted without bringing a democratic rule into being. The process, the report said, generated considerable uncertainty, economic disruptions and social unrest.  Budgetary control deteriorated, leading to fiscal deficits which exceeded 10 percent of GDP. Inflation rose to 40 percent in 1992, and 58 percent in 1993.  The official exchange was pegged below market rates, with the spread reaching 100 percent by late 1993. The external balance deteriorated significantly, with reserves dwindling and arrears to external creditors rising to more than $6 billion, or one fifth of outstanding debt. These combined, made the economy to grow by 4,1 percent in 1992 and 1.9 percent in 1993, compared with an average of five percent in the preceding six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Kenya, there was a sharp decline in major macro-economic performance indicators between 1990-92 following the abandonment of IMF/World Bank recommended reforms. However, in early 1993, the Kenyan authorities signaled an interest in restarting the reform process and as a result, the conditions for strong medium-term growth in Kenya, according to the report, have improved significantly. Implementation of stabilization policies and more effective enforcement of financial sector regulations, according to the report, have sharply reduced runaway inflation (falling to an annual rate of around 15 percent during the last quarter of 1993 after peaking at around 100 percent during the second quarter). &quot;Important steps towards structural reforms particularly in the area of external trade, have begun to gradually restore domestic and international confidence in the government's commitment to reform. With the elimination of all but a short list of import licenses and the introduction of unified and stabilised market-determined exchange rate (the Kenyan Shilling became fully convertible in May 1994), the stage has been set for the private, and especially the export sector to lead the recovery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda, according to the report, has gone quite far in creating a free enterprise economy. At the same time, the government has stabilised the economy through tight fiscal and monetary policies. These have reduced inflation to around four percent in 1993, down from 45 percent in 1992 and 240 percent in 1987, the year in which the present adjustment programme was initiated. The programme covers the civil service, public enterprises, and major financial institutions and a large cut in military forces to release resources for priority spending programmes. &quot;These reforms have had a positive effect on the economy: real GDP growth is estimated to have reached six percent in 1993, enabling per capita consumption to rise by about 2.5 percent. The lower inflation has contributed to a stable exchange rate and renewed confidence in the country's currency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This achievement, however, pales into insignificance compared with the growth in East Asia and the Pacific which at 9.2 percent, has outpaced that in every other developing region by at least five percentage points. China remained the fastest growing economy in the region - and the world. Growth in China has averaged 13 percent in the past two years, as the government continued to implement market-based reforms and as transitional corporations corporations continued to commit record amounts of investment. Malaysia and Thailand, two other prime recipients of foreign direct investment, once again displayed outstanding performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Latin America and Caribbean once again experienced gains in output as reforms in many countries continued to take root and show results. The report says that growth for the region as a whole, supported by large inflows of foreign private capital flows, rose to 3.5 percent from 2.8 percent in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In South Asia, growth slowed to 3.8 percent, partly as a result of devastating floods in Pakistan towards the end of 1992 and weak industrial growth in India. The report said that countries in the region showed improvements in their external account performance with increased exports and private capital flows. The fall in world oil prices by more than 10 percent, according to the report, contributed to a market decline in growth to an estimated 1.9 percent, in the Middle-East and North Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economic activity in the industrialised countries slowed further in 1993, too, to 1.2 percent as a result of sluggish growth in Japan and recession in continental Europe. Recovery in the United States, according to the report, was well underway by the fourth quarter of 1993 when output expanded by seven percent. Canada and the United Kingdom experienced a modest recovery in 1993. The slow pace of overall growth in 1993, says the report, was associated with rising unemployment, which reached 8.2 percent in the industrial countries as a group, rising to 10 percent in the labour force in several European countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week was remarkable. The UPC, who made their bones as republicans and abolished the kingdom and the quasi-federal Independence constitution in 1966, held a press conference to announce that now they were for federalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And if Buganda wanted federalism, they can have it. What is UPC up to?  That it is difficult to tell. What is certain, is that UPC is playing politics, perhaps hoping to win the support of the Buganda federalists in CA and get them to vote for multi-partyism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Will Buganda, which has been crying that the rest of Uganda has ganged up against them and does not appreciate their need for federalism cut a deal with UPC? No, because UPC is the monster in Buganda for having scrapped kingdoms, the Baganda delegates are still suspicious of it. They want votes for federalism, but it seems not from UPC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then with the NRM irritated by the last week's walk out from Committee Five by multi-partists because of what they saw as the dirty tactics used to pass an amendment giving the Movement another five years, President Yoweri Museveni called CA delegates from several western districts to his Rwakitura farm. There were raised eyebrows about the unusual &quot;regional caucus&quot; and expectations that, because a small group of NRM stalwarts had been in Rwakitura a day earlier on Tuesday, we were going to hear of some new initiatives to bring the political temperature in the country down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surprise, surprise! Instead we learn that the meeting was called to discuss a matter which most Ugandans thought had died out: The restoration of Obugabeship of Ankole which, the meeting decided, should continue to be on ice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost difficult to believe. These political works are not impressive.  The only impression they conveyed is of the old politics of under-the-table deals being reborn, confusion, and playing the fiddle while the country is burning. It is amazing how much the political class is consumed with conspiratorial and partisan politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amazing because they have an open forum - the CA - to articulate the thoughts they are putting out at press conferences and secretive palace meetings, but they are not taking advantage. Ministers have become so taken with constitution politics, either fighting for Movement, federalism, or against multi-partyists, they have forgotten they are ministers for all Ugandans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is more to life than back-room politics and plotting to win or cling to power. Ugandans are all too aware that periods like this with elections looming are dangerous precisely because leaders become too taken by narrow pursuits which can win them power, than broad politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Uganda's case, that has almost always been disastrous. Like in 1966/67 when the 1962 constitution was scrapped, 1971 when Obote I was overthrown, and 1985 when Obote II was overthrown, 1989 when the NRM tempted fate by extending itself in power without an electoral mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We hope the politicians will heed these signs from our history and bring back a degree of sobriety to the political scene.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following is excerpted from a report to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali by the Libyan permanent representative, Ambassador Mohamed Azwai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. Humanitarian consequences--The implementation of Security Council resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993) has had considerable humanitarian and social repercussions on the Libyan Arab people, particularly in the health and social security sector, which has been severely affected (medical supplies, therapeutic and preventive care, international technical cooperation.) It has also had a serious impact on the functioning and maintenance of vital equipment and on all economic aspects of health and social security. These adverse consequences can be summarized as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Impossibility of evacuating some 9,000 patients who could not be treated in Libya and should have been transported abroad by air ambulance or on board a commercial airline, in particular, where diseases were progressing or in emergency cases (including treatment of serious cardio-vascular disorders, kidney transplants, treatment of detached retinas, brain surgery and neurosurgery, spinal cord transplants, treatment of third-degree burns, cancer treatment).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Owing to the seriousness of their condition and the long distance over which they had to be transported, 350 of the patients who were to be transported by land to airports in neighboring countries died en route.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The programme under which, inter alia, Austrian, Yugoslav, German, Swiss, French, Italian, Polish, Bulgarian professors of medicine, specialists and university and medical school lecturers had been invited to Libya could not proceed as planned. Approximately 150 professors and specialists in various medical disciplines were prevented from coming to Libya in order to treat certain difficult cases, perform delicate surgery, help administer university examinations and attend international scientific conferences and medical colloquiums which are organized in Libya from time to time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, many Libyan doctors and professors had to abandon their plans to travel abroad in order to attend international conferences, meetings and study programmes and were thus prevented from expanding their knowledge, from participating in and benefiting from the work of these meetings and, hence, from keeping abreast of the progress achieved in today's world in various scientific fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Many foreign doctors and medical assistants had to turn down offers of employment from Libya. Thus, some 4,500 doctors and medical assistants who were to come to Libya to work had to abandon their plans. Moreover, more than 100 doctors and medical assistants resign every month; there have been a total of 2,500 resignations thus far. These staff reductions have seriously impaired the functioning of all health services in Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Without the necessary $10 million worth of spare parts which had been ordered, medical and electromechanical devices used at Libyan health centres could not be maintained properly. What is more, the foreign experts and technicians who were supposed to maintain them were not able to come to Libya. In most Libyan hospitals and health centres, the provision of health services was seriously impaired as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. The condition of allergy patients was aggravated by the fact that certain drugs and types of equipment essential to their treatment which had to be ordered urgently from abroad did not arrive on time. These delays were responsible for the death of some 350 infants in various Libyan hospitals and more than 150 women who had given birth, particularly after hemorrhaging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. The programmes that were to be carried out in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) could not be implemented. Most visits by international experts and working groups sent by WHO had to be postponed or cancelled. The situation has impeded the development and rehabilitation of the health sector, slowed down the implementation of primary health care programmes, compromised international cooperation activities undertaken in the field of health and prevented WHO from attaining its objectives under the strategy &quot;Health for All by the Year 2000&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8. The shipment of medical supplies and their clearance through customs were delayed, as the shipping documents did not arrive on time.  Moreover, the sanctions caused complications in the import and storage of serum, vaccines, blood products, hormones, laboratory reagents for the detection of AIDS and radioactive iodine. Because of the air embargo, these products had to be shipped by sea and stop in intermediate ports, and they deteriorated as a result. This happened, in particular, to poliomyelitis vaccines transported by ship. Many manufacturers are still obtaining information on the means by which to ship these products, which should only be shipped by air. The air embargo has not only caused the depletion of stocks but also slow deliveries which have resulted in waste, as certain products had expired by the time they arrived. The best example of this is the loss of much of the ocean cargo shipped by OANSSEM and TANSSEM, which specialize in the manufacture of analgesics, anesthetics and other medicines for hospitals and health centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9. One hundred fifty-six orders for medicines, medical devices, equipment and medical supplies could not be filled. The articles ordered included serums, vaccines, laboratory reagents and equipment for a total values of nearly $50 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10. Radioactive products for identifying certain hormones - which, as it is known, must be shipped by air directly from producer to consumer countries - could not be shipped. These products, particularly a drug called Mastin, are used in the treatment of cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 11. Exceptionally heavy traffic has resulted in 10,200 road accidents, including 1,622 deaths, 4,220 serious injuries or disabilities for life and 3,124 minor injuries. There are 9,200 persons who need to use a wheelchair following serious accidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 12. The Committee established by Security Council resolution 748 (1992) has been slow to grant authorization to transport patients in need of emergency treatment to other countries by air ambulance and on several occasions (as recently as 4 May 1994) prevented the evacuation of patients, which resulted in the death of many patients or caused their condition to deteriorate. There are no medical or legal grounds for such delays and refusals; they are but a reflection of the hostile position maintained by certain members of the Committee, in utter disregard of all humanitarian concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 13. The following are some of the difficulties confronting companies doing business with Libya:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - In an official letter dated 27 February 1993, the Austrian company VAMED ENGINEERING of Vienna (awarded a contract for a project for the delivery of equipment to the new central hospital of Tripoli) informed the Libyan authorities that the authorities of the United States of America would not authorize it to export medical equipment to Libya. The Libyan party was therefore forced to try and make other arrange- ments, which has, to this day, delayed the opening of the new central hospital of Tripoli;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - The Canadian company which was awarded a contract for the export of radiology equipment to Libya was prevented from doing so by the authorities of the United States of America;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - The Maltese company MEDAVIA, which specializes in emergency medical assistance, informed the Libyan authorities of the numerous difficulties confronting it as a result of pressure from a number of Western countries to stop exporting vital medical equipment to Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 14. The health sector experienced extreme difficulty in providing emergency services and supplying the necessary medical equipment to the Libyan rescue team which made every effort to carry out its humanitarian mission when a civil aircraft from the regular Libyan domestic airline crashed in flight between Bengazi and Tripoli. This accident, which occurred on 22 December 1992, resulted in 170 casualties. The victims were of different nationalities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few days after his return from a Chief Executives Organisation meeting in Argentina; and stopovers in South Africa, Ghana and Libya, President Yoweri Museveni called his traditional Press Conference in Kampala, November 9. The following are excerpts from an edited version of the Conference as recorded by the Monitor's Senior Sub Editor, Martin Lutalo Mpungu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni:...I looked at it ( the CEO meeting) as a strategy session for the American business. They wanted to know how to handle the events in the world. I think they call people whom they think can help them to understand the world better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ...My interest in talking to this group is that they are investors; general managers of big American companies. I talked to them with a view of inviting them to come here. This was an opportunity I didn't want to lose. I (also) stopped in South Africa. Mr. Mandela was not in the country, but I met some other leaders as well as some business people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... Argentina is a very rich country with, a lot of livestock and oil.  So I met the President (Menem), ministers, and Argentinean businessmen also.  I invited the president and he agreed to come and visit us. So it was a very good trip for me, for business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then I came through Ghana, I talked to Mr. Rawlings about Liberia, then I went to North Africa, to see Mr. Qadhafi about our bilateral relations. So that was our trip. The main thing was business, to bring investors here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ayebale Adnia (Market Place): Foreign investors see Africa as a continent torn by political strife and civil wars. However much countries like Uganda try to sell themselves, there is little chance that multinationals will look at them as individual countries. For example they say that (Eastern) Europe has attracted US$ 50 billion (In foreign investment); Asia US$16 billion and Africa only US$ 3 billion. How do you see the situation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni: Actually that was my topic--&quot;Does Africa Matter?&quot; People are wondering whether Africa matters. It was my duty to tell them that it matters. There is that opinion that Africa does not matter--mainly because of mismanagement by African leaders and ideological confusion among the African leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ...So it's true that American companies have the idea that Africa does not matter. Secondly, when they talk of Africa these days, they now talk of South Africa. So it's our job to wake them up and tell them that they are missing money here--because we are not asking them to come here and give us charity. We are asking them to come here and make money. And we also make money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, we are not limiting our investment drive to only American and European companies. The Indians know the value of East Africa. Those have no difficulty in coming here. Since (my trip to India) some of them have already got licenses like the fertiliser company to be involved in Tororo. TATA is building a workshop here and (another) Indian group dealing with shoes...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So I talked to the Americans, I talk to Indians, the Japanese, I talk to all of them. I also talk to the locals here. We are going to get investments one way or the other. The other day the (Uganda) Investment Authority published something in your papers saying that since 1972 they had registered 970 new enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So we need to call many people--many will not come but some will come.  This is our strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peter Mungerera - Voice of America: Is true there are mediation efforts, by Col. Qadhafi, to try and salvage the poor relations between Uganda and Sudan. Did he raise that matter when you met?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni: Yes, I discussed Sudan quite a lot with Colonel Qadhafi and I informed him of the mediation work by IGADD. When I came back, I (rang) President Moi - the chairman of this IGADD committee. Our view is that everything must be done through IGADD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mungerera: I mean Uganda and Sudan. It's been reported that Qadhafi has been trying to arrange for meditation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni: There is no problem between Uganda and Sudan. The problem is inside Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Ssentongo - The New Vision: Can we have a long lasting constitution if the constitution making process in the CA creates losers and winners?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni: Now, I'm a believer in broadbased politics and I'm also a believer in participatory politics. This however does not mean that there is no direction. There must be some direction. On some crucial issues. Like for instance in driving, you either drive on the left or on the right. So if you just drive in the middle of the road then you cause accidents. So if you just drive in the middle of the road then you cause accidents. So some of the issues need to be decided on. You can't leave them in the middle. However, as usual we are always ready to involve others in governance if we have the upper hand. This however, should not mean that we shouldn't decide. Because this is the moment to decide on some of the major issues. As you can see the things being debated in the constitution are strategic matters; and positions must be taken on some of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Martin Lutalo Mpungu - The Monitor: You talk of crossing the bridge when you get there. Yet the new NRM structure for post-CA government has already been drawn up. Isn't this creating the assumption that we are definitely having the Movement System after CA? And if, as assumed, even the lower RC's also became part of the state, isn't this a recipe for dictatorship?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni: Well, the proposals which the (NRM) Secretariat submitted ... will have to be debated by the CA. It's up to the CA to accept. So there is no prejudgement of the CA. If they do not accept it, it will be changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, the State being fused with the Movement well, how? The RC's are there and have been there all these years. But the chiefs are there. Chiefs who are not members of the RC's. The chiefs are not going to be removed. They will still be there because the RC's represent the movement side while the chiefs continue to be the case. There is no fusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think the only fusion is that if a president is elected, then you also become the chairman of the Movement. That is even done in western Europe where many of you draw your models from, because normally the head of the ruling party also becomes the Prime Minister. So I don't see anything new there. There is no fusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White Freelance, Rambo: You came to power talking about how foreign aid is a continuation of colonialism and now Uganda is accepting a lot of aid dollars. Why have you changed your view of whether or not foreign aid is a good economic policy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni: I have not changed my opinion. My opinion is the same. That we should build an integrated, independent and self sustaining economy. And that's what we are doing. If we get aid in order to achieve that independence of the economy, then that is consistence. It is not a divergence at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rambo: When you came to power, you said you were not going to accept much aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni: I never said I would reject aid, did I? However I said that we will make it the basis of our policy and even today, it is not the basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you take the budget this year, we hope to collect Shs. 500 billion by ourselves, yet the whole budget is Shs 800 billion. As I speak now, 62% of our revenue is by ourselves from our own resources. So rapidly we are moving towards eliminating dependence on foreign budgetary support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And besides, we borrow this money and pay it back. Each year we are paying the IMF and the World Bank. Each year we pay them US$120 million. It's not a one-way traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Timothy Kalyegira-Capital Radio: You implied that if you left the stage the situation will create its own leader. Is that situation chaotic or smooth?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni: With this succession we can no longer allow turmoil. If I leave leadership now, I will still be a Ugandan and together with other Ugandans we shall get a new leader. The problem in the past was that the people had no power. Some of the groups had hijacked the power from the population. What we have done now is to give power back to the people. So if we want to get a new leader, we shall work for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I don't like this argument that if Museveni goes there will be chaos.  The implication is that, that society does not have internal strength to stand up as a society. It is just depending on some single magician by the names of Museveni who using wizardry and has managed to put the people together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I came from the people and in the same way others will come from the people - as long as the people have got the freedom to chose through elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You see, this is an attempt to imply that African societies are basically unstable - that once in a while you get some wizards like Museveni who manage to check these wild people and as soon as those wizards go away, those Africans will go back to their ways of wildness. This is not the case.  Those people who were against Amin and Obote are there. They are the ones who produced us and they can produce other people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a rather shocking but fascinating story from down South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa has one of the world's widest gaps between the rich and the poor. The rich are so rich, the poor even look poorer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Imagine this; an average director of a big company earns Shs. 1.5 million a month yet an average worker earns Shs. 320,000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The difference is forty fold. It means that a worker has to toil 40 years or just about his entire life, to get what the boss earns just in one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And that is not the worst case. Recent surveys show that some directors earn Shs. 36 million a year and have been giving themselves annual increment of double the inflation rate. (7.6 p.a. now).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even further down the management ladder, imbalances persist. A middle rank manager earns a average salary of Shs. 40 million per year and an average worker Shs. 4 million. Ten fold difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even Newspapers which have indignantly fumed about the &quot;gravy train&quot; (eating) since Mandela came to power in April, are not any better. There are editors who earn Shs. 12 million a month, which is allegedly more than what president Mandela gets, and Shs. 24 million a year, more than the cabinet ministers. Guess what reporters earn! A paltry Shs. 0.8 million to Shs. 1.1 million a month. Again a ten fold difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's rich people know how to flask their wealth. Flashy cars, ostentatious mansions and glitzy casinos. All this, is juxtaposed with 46 percent unemployment and 7 (seven) million homeless. Most of the wealthy are, of course, whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The skewed value system is now being passed on to the emerging black entrepreneurial class. As they break out of their apartheid ghettos, these upwardly mobile copy-cats are reaching greedily for the big houses, the BMWs and the Shs. 1.5 million suits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the way, Ugandans living and working in South Africa have not been outdone. There is an average of two cars to every family of Ugandans working here. They live in good homes and go to the beach over the weekends. An average Ugandan family has two kids and both husband and wife hold good jobs.  They are either teachers or doctors, in a majority of cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are a few lucky ones who have broken into managerial levels. One was recently a director of medical services in the Bantustan, but has just been sacked. But I am told he still holds his pay package of somewhere around Shs. 3 million a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nobody seems to know how many Ugandans live and work in South Africa.  One Ugandan called Frank who holds a nice job in a finance company and claims to have arrived in Johannesburg earlier than other Ugandans, put his estimate to 500 Ugandans in Johannesburg and a total of 5,000 in the whole of South Africa. But other not so conservative estimates put the number above 50,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's not that these Ugandans have not suffered. Most of theme came here in phases. First a brief teaching stint in Kenya, (to earn money for a ticket) then to Zambia or Lesotho and finally South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have visited very many of them. They are an impressive lot; nearly all of them have their hearts back home. They would want to return only if they can afford to earn a living wage in Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They constantly live with the fear of being deported and that's why a good number of them have put up houses at home. They however have a defender in the name of Vice President Thabo Mbeki who is against deporting foreigners as a government policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One big hospital I visited in Ciskei had a total of 30 Ugandan doctors! And nearly every school has more than one Ugandan teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Mandela recently announced a cut in the presidential and ministerial salaries. Just a symbolic gesture to stem the &quot;gravy train&quot;, criticism. And also to encourage national austerity. It was not immediately know how much was going to be cut from how much of the president's pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already several workers' unions are on strike, demanding a pay rise.  By the end of this week, civil servants could be on strike, after rejecting token salary rises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Problem is that, President Mandela and his ANC party campaigned and won the April 27 election on the ticket of good life. They promised to end suffering to the millions of apartheid afflicted blacks. Now it is the time to match promises with deeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soon as he took the government, Mandela declared free education in schools and asked hospitals not to charge money for their services. He said South Africa was very rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the time South Africans realise that &quot;Ebyobwereere n'e Mulago bya ggwayo&quot; (Even Mulago no longer gives free services) it will be too late. One doctor told me that Eastern Cape region run out of a Shs. 3 billion medical budget in 5 months. The remaining six months of the financial year might see them with a broken medical service. Before this, they used to change some money to supplement the government budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But people in government are determined to push through the process of integration which has so far been marred by suspicion and racial divisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The army itself said it laxed on discipline in order to ease the integration process. The result was a massive desertion of over 2,500 army men- with their guns. All this has caused untold insecurity and social disorder which the ANC government is groping to tame. Mandela needs a lot of luck.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phillip van Niekerk, Weekly Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg), December 9, 1994</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1654 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few weeks ago Joe Slovo's battle with cancer took on a very public dimension. A dramatic weight loss and sudden gaunt appearance, brought on by an unfavourable response to new medication, unleash-ed frenetic speculation about whether the old communist, the most senior white person in the ANC, had fought his last political and personal battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview in his Pretoria office last week, it was hard to tell which was the more fragile, Slovo's health or his humour, as he faced the inevitable questions about his health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am in a stable condition,&quot; he snapped. &quot;I'm doing my work, as you see. You chaps go on and on about it. Like all of us, when we can't do our jobs, we'll say so.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His sharp response was softened by a flash of old Slovo wit. &quot;Life is a terminal illness,&quot; he added. &quot;We'll all go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite his advanced illness, Slovo is enjoying life as a cabinet minister, savouring the most &quot;challenging, most productive period&quot; of his life. He puffs contentedly on a cigarillo, but won't allow himself to be photographed smoking it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talk about Slovo's health has overshadowed his achievements as housing minister in President Nelson Mandela's government of national unity.  Into his domain falls one of the most visible inheritances of apartheid: nine million homeless people packed mostly into squalid squatter camps ringing the cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Housing is the yardstick against which Mandela's government will be judged to have succeeded or failed in its primary task of delivering a better life to black South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But before the building can even start, a political impasse has to be broken. Law and order has collapsed in many townships, and the boycott of bond repayments, rent and service payments -- begun as resistance to the old order -- has only grown under the new government, and along with it the banks' retaliatory red-lining of black areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The banks fear to tread because of the complete breakdown of civil law enforcement,&quot; said Slovo. &quot;They have got something like 18 000 properties for which they've received judgment for eviction, and are unable to implement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To end the stand-off, Slovo has put together the most pragmatic of compacts: coaxing the banks back into the township market by deploying state funds to underwrite mortgages, while cajoling black residents into resuming monthly payments with the carrot of community upliftment and the stick of eviction threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have spent this period charting the path ahead, ensuring that all the relevant stakeholders are with us.  &gt;From early next year the fruits of this will start to show themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This question: 'what have you delivered?' was ridiculously asked after three months. The question is: 'are the resources there? Do you have strategy in place? Has progress been made?' I am sure that is the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If employing private investment and individual ownership is an odd policy for an avowed communist, Slovo's plans to house the millions who can't afford mortgages are even more unorthodox: the state will provide sites with the basics of electricity, water and sewage and a slab. Apart from backup in the form of know-how and access to cheap materials, responsibility for putting a roof over the heads of South Africa's millions will depend on &quot;mobilising the sweat equity of the people themselves&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You cannot build an economy or a society purely on the basis of entitlement,&quot; said Slovo, who for many years admired Eastern Bloc societies where the state was meant to provide from cradle to grave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People have to make a contribution. They have to have a sense of ownership which they don't get from being given blocks of rented accommodation which they don't own, don't have a stake in and haven't helped to design.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slovo still considers himself a communist. &quot;It's not on the agenda now, it's not the issue now, but I believe with what we are doing in every sphere -- the reconstruction and development programme and so forth -- we are creating a foundation in which there will be all kinds of possibilities including a movement away from the domination of the economy by the criteria of profit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is, however, contrite about his lifelong support for the Soviet Union and that model of socialism. Gone is the old defensiveness. In a remarkably frank moment during the interview, he said: &quot;I was wrong and I am ashamed of some of the traps I was led into.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He explained: &quot;If you've ever been part of an official delegation you learn less about a country than sitting in the British museum. You don't meet the people, you don't actually see the conditions. People said there were gulags, millions of people incarcerated there. We were assured there was no such thing. We didn't have opportunities to actually check.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slovo still points out that the Eastern Bloc was not all &quot;tyranny and evil and murder and mayhem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You're talking about a world that pioneered the modern eight-hour day, women's equality and free education. Every segment of the welfare capitalist world originated in the socialist world and the battle between the two had an impact on the more tolerable conditions in the capitalist world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He admitted that his own doubts began in the mid-1960s but he chose to remain silent because he had seen the alternative close at hand. His wife, the fiercely independent author and academic Ruth First, was, he said, sidelined by the movement. He said he had differences with her on this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The choice that you face is whether you can continue to contribute to the struggle or not. At that stage, independence was just not tolerated.  It was part of the sickness we tried to get away from eventually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For me, the question was: do I now take a lecturer's job in London?  In retrospect I would have made a big mistake if I'd allowed my doubts, which were growing and growing, to lead to a withdrawal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is in that context that Slovo's contribution makes sense. He is a pragmatist, prepared to compromise to achieve a larger goal: in this case, national liberation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While pointing out that &quot;we are still living in an apartheid state&quot;, Slovo admits to feeling &quot;smug&quot; about the way things have gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A brief few years ago he was the b_te noire of the white establishment, a target for assassination. His wife was blown up in Maputo by a parcel bomb sent by the South African security forces. Today he is one of the most respected cabinet ministers in South Africa, working from the offices of the very politicians who made him out to be the epitome of all evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He savours the twists of fortune that have taken him from membership of a &quot;relatively powerless grouping&quot; in the 1940s, through the defiance campaign, exile and armed struggle, the negotiating process, the attainment of power, to the beginnings of reconstruction. At every point Slovo was a key player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The last year or two have been the happiest in my life.  There have been miraculous achievements in this period.  It's working. We're going to have major and minor hiccups, but I'm optimistic. I think that in general we are going to achieve our targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I could happily lie down and die now because what more does a person want out of life than the life I have had?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But beneath the self-confidence, Slovo betrayed a vulnerability, as the subject he least likes to talk about resurfaced on its own. &quot;I have cancer. What can I tell you?  I also have feelings.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THERE was before the airplanes. And there was after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just before 1pm on Tuesday, 10 May, six South African Air Force jets swept over the Union Buildings in Pretoria, each trailing one of the six colours of the new South African flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were OUR planes, from OUR air force, trailing OUR national colours, over OUR seat of government, in OUR capital city. The crowd gathered in the amphitheatre below -- most of whom would never have been allowed near the building in the past -- gasped with the realisation that the air force was saluting its new commander-in- chief, President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was Zero Hour in the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The end of the year marks Zero Hour plus 235 days -- a fitting time to make a sober assessment of the new order. It is more than twice the 100 days Mandela gave himself in his inauguration speech to show progress, and considerably longer than any reasonable honeymoon period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, the afterglow lingers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minister without Portfolio Jay Naidoo summoned journalists to his plush office in the Union Buildings last week to pre-empt suggestions that there had been little progress in the government of national unity's reconstruction and development programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He showed impressively thick business plans for major RDP projects; he outlined the elaborate processes that he had gone through to reach this stage; he spoke of the progress of proper policy formulation, full consultation and the creation of structures to ensure effective delivery; and he blamed poor goverment communication for the impression that things were moving slowly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of which is true and important. What he couldn't show was a house, a sewerage pipe, a borehole, a transformed township, or a new school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that hardly seems to matter at the moment. Despite all the pundits warning about heightened expectations at the grassroots and growing impatience among the mass of deprived people, there is little tangible evidence of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela himself has been going out of his way to explain why reconciliation was the initial priority of his government, and how it was essential -- and not inimical -- to reconstruction. If he did not get the recalcitrant old guard behind the RDP, and undermine resistance to it, there would be precious little progress, he has quite rightly pointed out at any available occasion in the past few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He and other ANC leaders were clearly worried about the flak they might catch at last weekend's triennial national conference of the ANC, with branch representatives demanding progress on social transformation. It didn't materialise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why not? Partly, it is a tribute to the success of the policy of reconciliation, and the extent to which the restoration of relative peace in most of the country is - - for the time being -- enough to keep people happy.  But it is also because the issue of raised expectations and grassroots impatience has been exaggerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opinion polls show high approval ratings for the government. Mandela is universally loved and trusted. There is an instinctive understanding that change is difficult and will take time. How much time is altogether another question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clearly, the new government faces grave difficulties in delivering on its promises to build one million houses, electrify 2,5-million homes, provide 10 years of free and compulsory education for all, create masses of jobs ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The major obstacle is the civil service -- too big, too old guard, too costly, too much apartheid duplication. And the negotiated agreement to protect all civil service jobs -- the price of reconciliation -- now looks as if it may have been a huge mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, the agreement is to protect jobs, not positions, and to abide by labour legislation in the event of any job terminations. They would have had to do that anyway, so it was not that much of a concession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, the problem has been the inability of the Commission for Public Administration, headed by Minister Zola Skweyiya, to rise to the challenge of transforming the civil service. He started off the crudest of ways: creating 11 000 affirmative action jobs. It was difficult to see that would transform the service into an effective and efficient one, but anyway the process ground to a halt when he was flooded with two million applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second obstacle was the lack of effective local authorities. These should provide much of the engine of reconstruction at a local level, but elections are only scheduled for late next year -- leaving a huge gap in the RDP delivery machinery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A third factor has been the chaos in some of the provincial governments. Some, notably the Orange Free State, inherited a coherent administration and relative order and were able to get down to business quickly. Others, notably the Eastern Cape and Northern Transvaal, face the nightmare of unifying three apartheid administrations. Leadership has not always been effective, and progress has been uneven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Probably the greatest factor of all is the extent to which almost every government department has to be redirected, its resources rechannelled, its structures changed to meet the completely different tasks the new government is setting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bulk of Naidoo's work, in fact, is not the showcase 22 presidential projects, but the daily grind of ensuring that departments shift their resources to meet RDP priorities. This also involves battles between departments -- over issues such as whether the navy should buy four new ships while health has to cut back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is easy to see only these problems. Less easy to see is the remarkable transformation of our political discourse and almost all of our political institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's greatest achievement has been to unite all sectors of South Africa's highly stratified society behind its RDP. Although the plan is being treated like Mao's Little Red Book, it does mean the debate is no longer over whether there should be a redistribution of resources, but on how to achieve this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are the one country in the world where all sectors have thrown their weight behind a radical social transformation. There are, of course, important differences over how this should happen -- but nobody is arguing any longer that it shouldn't happen, and that it shouldn't happen as quickly as practically possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Notable at the ANC's conference last week was the lack of ideological dispute, even from communist party and Cosatu stalwarts. The mood is an overwhelmingly pragmatic one: how do we deliver to our constituency effectively and timeously? The debate over privatisation, for example, has transcended the rhetorical flourishes of previous years, and is now focused on whether this policy will release assets for the RDP, and how this can be achieved without compromising the delivery of essential services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the clearest signs of national unity was the fact that the new government imposed an effective wealth tax, though they called it a transition levy, placing a heavy additional burden on those with higher incomes to fund the costs of the election, peacekeeping and the integration of the armed forces. Having warned for years against the dangers of a wealth tax, business and the middle classes accepted it without much protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new, radical social democratic agenda is being felt in all sectors -- education, health, welfare, housing -- but with varying degrees of progress and effectiveness in each of them. One notable areas of progress and one which will fundamentally affect social relations is the draft new labour legislation. Due for release any day now, it is designed to replace the traditionally antagonistic dichotomy of industrial relations with a tripartite partnership among organised labour, business and the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some manufacturers, such as Volkswagen, have been quick to anticipate this and have already adopted groundbreaking agreements that cross the divide between owners and workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most foreign investors, however, are still treating this country with circumspection, watching from a distance to see if stability and growth last beyond the honeymoon. The biggest launch in years was Pepsi's, filling Ellis Park with the music of Whitney Houston and the skies of Johannesburg with fireworks. It was the model black advancement investment, with the new wave of South African businessmen getting into the trenches with African-American investors to fight the cola wars. But the crowd of unemployed outside the new Pepsi factory was unimpressed and refused to go away. Not the kind of sight investors want to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;brothers&quot; from National Sorghum Breweries set the tone for new black-owned business with the launch of its Vivo beer. They described their rival's products as &quot;as pale and sour as the people who made them&quot;; in contrast, they said, &quot;Vivo's got soul&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's the first affirmative beer -- and the Africanism inherent in its marketing signals a clear divide in the new South Africa. Black middle class expectations of post-apartheid reward are met by near-hysteria in most of the Afrikaans media about white victims of affirmative action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parliament also acquired a soul, transforming within weeks from a crusty, tradition-bound home for otherwise unemployable friends of the ruling party, to a vibrant and lively institution for otherwise unemployable ex- freedom fighters. Debate in the chamber was as dull and purposeless as ever, but suddenly the previously comotose parliamentary committees, under the influence of energetic activists, sprang to life and became cabinet watchdogs and critical forums for debate and policy- making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parliament was the one institution that took to heart the constitution's fundamental commitment to openness and accountability. The other extreme was marked, ironically, by the Judicial Service Commission, which ignored the spirit in which it was created and chose to operate in darkness, choosing supreme court judges in secrecy and banning the broadcast media from its hearings to choose Constitutional Court judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Incidentally, those hearings provided an early test of civil society in the new South Africa -- and it failed. Very little was heard from any of the major interest groups -- such as women, workers, black lawyers, the broadcast industry -- which could be expected to assert themselves on issues important to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But these interest groups have much to trumpet about. Ironically, the ANC's firmly progressive social policies put it way ahead of its own constituency. It will be interesting to see if it can sustain its firmly anti- capital punishment, pro-abortion, pro-gender rights, sympathy-for-illegal immigrants policies in the face of growing unemployment and rising crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None of this will matter, however, if the government fails to show tangible evidence of delivery on housing, education, health and jobs before the extended honeymoon ends and the afterglow wears off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Patience will be running out about a year after the inauguration, May 10 1995. It would be good to see the six air force planes repeat their salute, but if Naidoo is doing his job properly, he will probably have diverted their fuel payments to the health budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And everyone will celebrate (except maybe a few pilots). Zero Hour plus one year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Sani Abacha, head of state, is fast confirming that he has learnt nothing from his predecessors.When words went round that he would make an anniversary broadcast last Thursday, expectations were high that he would use the occasion to relax some of the stern measures taken by government now that it has a firm hold on to power. As a reconciliatory gesture, it was expected that he would de-proscribe the media houses shut down in the wake of the June 12 crisis, release some political detainees and put some balm on strained nerves. But Abacha's speech contained not such conciliatory moves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his 11-page address, Abacha once again took on the labour leaders whom he had chalked out of their posts in the wake of the protracted pro-democracy strike of July and August. He said the government was aware that some leaders of the oil workers union and their senior staff counter-parts as well as those of the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, &quot;were spurred on by financial inducements&quot; from those who were bent on making the political programme of this government unworkable. This included foreign interest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a tone laced with anger, he said &quot;these unpatriotic Nigerians embarked on a protracted and debilitating, politically motivated strike action&quot; in the name of collective bargaining and protecting workers interest.  He said it was obvious that the leadership of the NLC, NUPENG and PENGASSAN did not have the approval of the overwhelming majority of the trade union movement for their actions. As he put it, it was &quot;criminal and grossly unpatriotic to set out deliberately to disrupt and weaken our efforts at revival&quot; as the labour leaders did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the same vein, the head of state made a veiled reference to opposition politicians whose continued detention has been decried of by both local and international pressure groups. He said that despite the loud and untrue protestations of certain individuals, &quot;none of our citizens has been penalised or taken so far by his government saying it was to calm the political atmosphere and ensure smooth take off of the foundations of a new democratic Nigeria through the constitutional conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Abacha, in his review of the press situation in the country said it remained the freest in Africa adding that Nigeria is one of the few countries in the continent where private press outnumber government newspapers. But this freedom he said, was abused necessitating the closure of some media houses. He, however, stopped short of saying that the shut media houses will be de-proscribed. In his review of the relation between his government and the press, Abacha recalled that out of sheer good gestures were spurned by some sections of the press &quot;as they relished in deliberate incitement and seditious falsehood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state of the economy which has proved to be the Achiles heel of previous administrations remained a sore point on which the head of state sang the same old tune. For the umpteenth time, the refrain repeated that this government, like its predecessors, is making effort to revive the nation's neglected agriculture and mining sectors. Said the head of state: &quot;Our studies show that if we return to full production in agriculture and resume our abandoned interests in mining other than in oil, we would not only feed ourselves, our earning from those sectors would surpass that from oil exports.&quot; He, however, did not say whether the measures to be adopted in this regard will take the pattern of Operation Feed the Nation, OFN, the Green Revolution, GR, or the Directorate of Food, Road and Rural Infrastructure, DFFRI, all of which were tried by the past three administrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However the head of state was categorical that, the high cost of food items, among others notwithstanding, his government was not considering the options resorted to by past administrations which tried to provide the emergency relief through importation of food items. The reasons he would not do this is clear: In the past, it &quot;led to abuse, to mismanagement and it created a crop of unpatriotic persons who took the opportunity to enrich themselves and frustrate the efforts of government. &quot;This administration is not tempted to go down the road of emergency importations in order to create an artificial atmosphere of well being&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just as the head of state is not willing to spare his political oponents, so also is he set to make life tough for those who put spanner in the works for his fiscal policies. To that end, managers of the nation's financial institutions who have contribued to failures of the banking industry are in for a hard time. The failed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial Malpractices in Banks decree has been promulgated. The decree, which empowers the National Deposit Insurance Corporation, NDIC, and the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, to deal more decisively with bank failures, also establishes special tribunals to try culprits who have ruined some of the financial houses. In addition, a dree to try economic offenders has also been promulgated. The National Economic Intelligence Committee, NEIC, decree as it is called, has the powers of a watch-dog which will also try offenders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The visit of the six-man team of United States congressmen last week left prodemocracy activists and groups in a sour mood and with the feeling that American support for the validation of the annulled June 12 elections last year and the installation of Moshood Abiola, believed to have won the election, as president, is fast waning. According to Harry Johnston, spokesman for the team, the visit was largely to understand the political situation&quot; in the country and not to impose solutions. He added that in view of recent developments in the country and on the ongoing National Constitutional Conference, the United States was reviewing its past posture while hoping for better days ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last July, the US house of representatives had passed a resolution stating that continued cordial relation between the US and Nigeria depended on the restoration of democracy. Also the administration of President Bill Clinton had imposed sanctions on Nigeria which included the suspension of $450,000 military aid, expulsion of the Nigerian military attache in Washington and an embargo on visits by all senior government and military officers and their relations to the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Femi Falana, a lawyer and prodemocracy activist, said last week that the visit of the congressmen and their comments represented a shift in the US perception of the country's situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The congressmen arrived in the country November 17, four months after members of a similar team were allegedly refused visas. The team which also had Donald Payne, Floyd Flake, Alcee Hastings, Cynthia McTinny and William Jefferson as members discussed with Sani Abacha, a general and the head of state; met with Abiola and parleyed with the human rights community.  Newswatch learnt that at meeting with Abacha, the congressmen could not get a firm commitment on the terminal date of the military government. According to sources, at the meeting held between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m., November 18, the Americans were made to understand that the military would disengage &quot; as soon as possible&quot;. One of the congressmen was said to have noted that as soon as possible could mean next year or the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the meeting with the prodemocracy and civil rights groups in the residence of the American ambassador, the congressmen took part in a stormy session. Falana confirmed to Newswatch that at a point discussions degenerated into a shouting match. The congressmen explained that the United States had to review its stand as it was being isolated by other western nations. During heated debate one of the congressmen claimed that the crux of the problem was that Abiola was hand-picked by his friend, Ibrahim Babangida former president and that following a disagreement between them, Babangida annulled the elections. He observed that election results of 23 presidential aspirants were also canceled and no one complained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources say that at this point, Olabiyi Durajaiye was said to have explained that he was one of the 23 aspirants and that no complaint was heard because all the aspirants agreed with the cancellation of the results. He also noted that the elections were canceled at the party primaries level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The congressmen were also hosted by Kudirat, wife of Abiola, who asked them to declare their stand on June 12. They were said to have explained that they were the only parliament that had passed a resolution on the June 12 issue, but did not make any categorical declaration on the annulled elections this time. A source said that the farthest they went was to call for the release of Abiola who is in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Payne and Jefferson, both members of the congressional black caucus were said to have seen Abiola in detention. According to sources, Abiola was said to have expressed his disappointment with the way the American government was handling the June 12 issue. He was said to have sent a strong message to the caucus through the two congressmen. At the end of their visit last week the congressmen said that Abiola's release from detention would be &quot;a right step in the right direction.&quot; But government had earlier said that it was still holding Abiola in jail pending its appeal at the Supreme Court against an appeal court order that Abiola be released on bail. The government had filed a 10 ground appeal to the Supreme court against the order. Last week Kudirat appealed to Clinton not to abandon Nigerians in their quest for democracy. She called on the American president to impress upon the military administration the need to respect the rule of law and release Abiola from detention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank, one of the nation's leading lenders, has given a positive response to the four year timetable to democratic constitutional rule announce by the Head of State Lt. Yahya Jammeh, last Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A press release issued by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs and broadcast over Radio Gambia at the weekend said the Bank had now officially lifted the temporary suspension which it had imposed on its projects in The Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The suspension followed the events of July 22, when the democratically elected government of Sir Dawda Jawarwa was toppled in a military coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bank's decision to suspend funds, according to the release, followed a fact finding mission by the Banks officials to The Gambia in September. During the visit, the mission held discussions with the Chairman and Head of State, Lt. Jammeh and all members of the Council and of the Cabinet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The release stated: &quot;Subsequent to the outcome of the Mission and the fact that the AFPRC made pronouncements to adhere to all our ongoing macro-economic policies and programmes with the Bretton Woods institutions, the Bank has now officially lifted the temporary suspension, resumed disbursement for all ongoing programmes and projects and the re-establishment of normal relationship with the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the release, the Ministry of Finance &quot;welcomed the announcement with relief&quot; and extended appreciation to all beneficiaries &quot;for their patience and understanding during the brief period of suspension.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the leading beneficiaries are Gamworks, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) which is poised to undertake an impressive and wide ranging number of development projects in the country; the National Environment Agency; the Gambia Port Authority; and the education sector, in which the World Bank and the African Development Bank are funding a US$14.6 million project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resumption of disbursements is bound to have a positive impact on the construction industry which in recent weeks, has been scaling down operations and laying off workers due to lack of contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many contractors are depending on Gamworks, the school projects and GPA's Phase III development programme to keep them busy for the foreseeable future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The business community in general may also feel some sense of relief, given the diverse spin-offs from these and other projects affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But many businesses would be anxious to know what compromises would be made (if there are any) on the timetable that would cause the United States and the European Union to resume full measure of their aid to The Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already, the European Union has suspended some aid to The Gambia. The United States last Friday suspended some aid to The Gambia. The United States last Friday suspended bilateral aid to The Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The suspension conforms with section 508 of the FY 1994 Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and the related Programs Appropriations Act which (like past and subsequent annual appropriations Acts), provides that no funds appropriated or made available under the Act will be obligated or expended to finance directly any assistance to any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the law allows some exceptions, including humanitarian aid if it is in the U.S. national interest, balance of payments support and other government-to-government aid for The Gambia has stopped and cannot resume until the president of the US determines that democratic government has been restored in The Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a press release from the U.S. bilateral assistance for The Gambia, including $100,000 in security assistance, amounted to about $10.9 million in FY 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A U.S. State Department Official, David Johnson, said that &quot;the US will provide no economic or security assistance to the Gambian military Government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Humanitarian aid, however, will be continued, according to Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Johnson said &quot;the AFPRC's plan to delay ceding power until 1998 in wholly unreasonable. &quot;We call upon the AFPRC to reconsider its proposed timetable and to work with the Gambian people to restore democratic civilian rule within 12 months,&quot; Johnson said in his statement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African urban areas, like urban areas in other parts of the world, share a common trait of urban violence, usually accompanied by high casualty figures. This was the submission of participants at a symposium on Urban Management and Urban Violence in Africa held last week in Ibadan. Casualty figure during the Kano ethnic/religious riot of 1953 was put at 277. Of the number, 36 were killed, while 241 were treated in hospitals. Another riot in the Northern part of Nigeria in 1966 led by people protesting the legitimacy of General Aguyi Ironsi's government resulted in the death of over 300 people. At least 650 people were injured. And in 1980, the Maitatsine riot claimed the lives of over 5,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case in South Africa is also terrible. The Soweto riots of 1976 costs 575 people their lives, while 3907 were injured. Between January and April this year, over 1,000 deaths were recorded in the Kwazulu/ Natal Province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The symposium was fashioned to identify the various violent behaviors in sub-Saharan Africa and the challenges they pose to urban management officials. Akin Mabogunje, former chairmen of the National Board for the Community Banks and chairman, organising committee of the symposium, identified six major causes of urban violence. These are ethnic, religious, pervasive, social, cultural, and state-sponsored violence. According to Mabogunje, by 2020 AD, about 600 million people will be living in the urban areas of Africa. &quot;The issue before this symposium, is thus, how well would these 600 million people live; how free from fear and violence will their lives be; how well-ordered and managed would the affairs of our cities become with passing years?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eighty-three academicians from within and outside Nigeria presented papers on the issue. The researches of the scholars covered Zimbabwe, Cairo, Congo, Gabon, Angola, Mozambique, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Togo, Kenya, Ethiopia and Cote d'Ivoire. The speakers traced the origin of such violence to inequalities in housing, unemployment, the widening gap between the rich and the poor, inadequate health care facilities, transportation problems and the educational system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disparity in housing for the rich and the poor and an unplanned environment were some of the issues speakers who spoke on housing touched on.  Tunde Agboola of the Centre for Urban and Regional Planning, CURP, University of Ibadan, UI, said that the country is suffering the fate of a late starter in its housing policies. He spoke on &quot;The politics and administration of housing standards and the structure of African cities.&quot; Agboola observed that in Africa, &quot;government and people don't value planning. Once people don't appreciate the essence of planning, there is a problem.&quot; He observed that &quot;politics and politiking area also human elements that impede planning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his own paper, Ben Arimah, of CURP, IU, said that the politics involved in African housing policies has made the execution of such policies impossible. A good example he said is the land use decree. The rich, Arimah noted, have been able to make a mess of the decree. This has resulted in some parts of Nigerian cities being overcrowded while there is land available in other parts. Lagos is a good example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of very great interest to participants at the symposium was the paper: &quot;The area boys of Lagos: A study of organised street violence&quot;, presented by Wuyi Omitoogun of the Centre for Trans Saharan Studies, University of Maiduguri. Omitiigun attributed the trend in unemployment among the youths who now constitute themselves into area boys. This is the trend in Dakar, Nairobi and Johannesburg. But Femi Odekunle, a professor of criminology at the Ahmadu Bello University, ABU, was quick to point out that area boys as well as motor park touts have their own functions. He observed that in South Africa, some of the street boys were those who fought for the freedom of the apartheid enclave. Same was the situation in Nigeria when the June 12, 1993 election was annulled. &quot;Some of these so-called area boys even engage in the filling of pot holes on our roads,&quot; Odekunle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The symposium was jointly organised by the French Institute for the Research in Africa, IFRA, Ibandan, and the Institute for African Studies, University of Ibandan at the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C.-- Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, the victor in internationally supervised elections earlier this year, has a new cabinet largely drawn from the top ranks of previous governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chissano's Frelimo party, which has governed the country since independence from Portugal in 1975, won the late-October balloting, defeating his main rival Afonso Dhlakama. leader of Renamo, by a 53 - 34 percent margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No one from opposition political parties was named to the Cabinet, which was sworn in on December 23 in the capital Maputo, although the key post of minister in the presidency for defense and security remained unfilled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government had asked the chairman of the National Electoral Commission, Brass Mazola, to take a cabinet position but he declined because, he said, participation might give the appearance that he had been partial in overseeing the polling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pascal Mocumbi, the former foreign minister, takes over as prime minister and the former health minister, Leonardo Simao, has been moved to the slot of foreign affairs. Mocumbi himself was health minister before he became foreign minister and was named prime minister in part because of his close relationship with Chissano.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cunje, Angola -- There's something odd and remarkable about Tradia Milagre. She keeps smiling, flashing a toothy picket fence of cheer and domesticity while relating the story of her family's survival, the bullet that grazed her seven-year-old's head, foraging for food in a mine field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's only when attention is called to herself, to her strength, that this 31-year-old mother of six retreats into frowning despair, slipping into the well of grief that the survivors of Angola's 19 years of war share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her name, Milagre, means miracle and it fits. While tens of thousands of others perished around her in the nine-month siege on the city of Cuito, 7 kilometers south of Cunje, last year, Milagre managed to keep her family alive and intact.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is through this combination of strength, endurance and luck that Angolans will have to rebuild their country if the peace accord holds. Their oil-and diamond-rich nation of 10 million people is sewn with land mines, the economy is in shambles, social and industrial infrastructure has collapsed.  Less than 18 percent of Angola's children complete the fourth grade, said Peter Hawkins, director of the British branch of the relief group Save the Children in the capital, Luanda. &quot;That is the generation in 20 years time that is going to be running the country,&quot; he said, reflecting the huge leap Angolans have to make to rehabilitate themselves. &quot;Angola is now faced with rebuilding an infrastructure which has been totally and absolutely destroyed: one, by the physical impact of the war, two, by the economic collapse as a result of the fighting, and three, by the massive displacement of populations and movement of those populations, divorcing themselves away from their traditional ways of life,&quot; said Hawkins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nowhere in the country is the war's destruction more apparent than in Cuito, where an estimated 30,000 people died-- at least a third of the city's population--in the battle between government and rebel forces last year. At one point, both sides occupied the city, blasting the skyline to Swiss cheese, until the government routed the rebels last July from the rubble they controlled to at least 50 kilometers beyond the city limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A &quot;blitz spirit&quot; as one aid worker put it, has gripped Cuito's residents who are eager to rebuild their community. Some schools, with the assistance of the Irish-based relief group Concern, opened last week in buildings that remained relatively intact. There's a new restaurant and even a disco. The feebly marked graves in yards have yielded to stalks of green corn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The city's changing very quickly,&quot; said Bruno Leger, of the Belgian branch of Doctors Without Borders, as a man filled in bullet holes on the facade of one of Cuito's hospitals. &quot;We just arrived one month ago. There was just four or five cars in the town, now you can see many. There are many civilians working; when we arrived (there were) mostly military and disabled people. Now it seems that the city is living again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But unseen danger still threatens to maim or kill Cuito's survivors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In every hedgerow, by the side of the road, inside buildings there's unexploded ordinance&quot; creating a veritable smorgasbord of land mines, grenades and bombs,&quot; said Mike Marmol, who works for the British de-mining agency Halo Trust in Cuito. Bullets might stop flying and planes might stop bombing, but a mine stays in the ground,&quot; he said. &quot;A miner can lay it and it can kill his grandchild.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearly every day produces another land mine victim or victims, aid workers say. Last week, three people pushing a loaded wheelbarrow along a path not far from the airport ran over an anti-tank mine. They were buried where they died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Halo Trust is training 25 Angolans in Cuito how to de-mine, hoping they will spread their knowledge about mine awareness. Among the volunteers were a professional volleyball player and a teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everybody has military experience because they've been fighting for their lives&quot; said Marmol. Indeed, most Cuito residents own guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nobody knows how many mines have been sewn throughout Angola, but relief workers say there are millions. And even if a field isn't mined, simply the fear that it might be is enough to keep people off land that they could use for farming. Often, civilians end up eating seeds provided by relief groups instead of risking the danger of planting them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has not yet authorized humanitarian de-mining, saying the political and military situation is too unstable to warrant the removal of defensive mines. On the other hand, the government can also gain political leverage with each mine that explodes, pointing the finger at the rebels. And until the government and guerrillas prove to the international community that they are ready for peace, international aid to de-mining operations will likely be slow in coming. If the country is still at war, donors see little need for spending money to remove mines that might soon be replaced.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. -- Although top officials in both the Clinton White House and the Republican Congressional leadership have academic backgrounds in African affairs, Africa faces a tough battle in 1995 for shrinking foreign aid resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the incoming speaker of the House of Representatives and one of the most powerful figures in Washington, wrote his doctoral dissertation on Belgium's colonial policies in what was then the Congo, now Zaire. But his political focus has been largely on domestic issues, and cutting foreign aid is on his party's agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On a nine-day visit to eight African countries in December, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, President Clinton's top foreign policy aide, tried to ease fears about American intentions. Lake, who wrote his thesis on sanctions against white-ruled Rhodesia, told African leaders that President Bill Clinton cares deeply about Africa's future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, Lake warned that the region &quot;risks becoming the odd man out&quot; in a global economy unless African nations resolve internal disputes, develop responsive governments and promote sustainable development.  Levels of U.S. aid to Africa will be influenced, he said, by &quot;shrinking budgets and honest skepticism about the return on our investment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Key Republicans, including North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms, the new chairman the powerful Foreign Relations Committee, already have proposed substantial cuts in foreign assistance. One approach under discussion is a reduction of the three-year $600 million aid package for South Africa to allow aid levels for other African countries to be maintained without increasing the over-all appropriation for the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who is taking over the subcommittee overseeing foreign aid, has said he has &quot;a hard time finding an American national interest&quot; in Africa. He wants to eliminate the annual appropriation known as the Development Fund for Africa, which totals about $800 million this year and has helped to shield Africa's small share of the foreign aid budget from further erosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Funds for peacekeeping also may be cut by Republicans with Angola providing the first test of the new Congress' intentions. A vote to reduce the U.S. contribution to the United Nations expanded operation in support of the recent Angola peace accord could come in the early weeks of the 1995 session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Any attempt to abolish the Development Fund for Africa and other forms of support for Africa will be resisted by the Congressional Black Caucus, which remains a large voting bloc in the House of Representatives. But the Republican election gains in November have reduced Caucus influence, because all but three of its 41 members are in the Democratic minority. The group's ability to shape legislation may also be affected by a Republican-engineered elimination of congressional funding for all House caucuses, which leaves interest groups scrambling for resources to pay for offices and staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the string of setbacks, however, has come a victory that Africa advocates on Capitol Hill did not anticipate. Congressional Republicans have decided to retain the House subcommittee on Africa, which had been slated for merger with another subcommittee under a restructuring plan proposed by the old Democratic leadership. In line to head the Africa group is Cuban-American Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, whose views on African issues are not yet known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the Senate side, the Africa subcommittee will be chaired by Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, who has a lengthy record of interest in African issues. As a member of the subcommittee, she visited Africa, championed Namibian independence, and was a proponent of increased attention to Africa during the Reagan and Bush presidencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to White Hose aide Anthony Lake, the Clinton administration will seek to work with the new Congressional leadership to develop a three-point program for Africa, which will reverse the current ratio of $2 spent on disasters for every dollar spent on development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, Lake said, there will be a focus on crisis prevention, using a combination of &quot;traditional relief techniques and new technology.&quot; The second emphasis will be on crisis recovery, with special attention to agriculture and to the rebuilding of roads and dams. The third priority, which Lake termed the most important, will be &quot;such long-term challenges as overpopulation, the role of women and environmental decay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the headquarters of the Organization of African Unity in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Lake said the Clinton foreign policy team rejects &quot;Afro-pessimism,&quot; but also seeks to avoid &quot;the illusions of Afro-optimism.&quot; Nevertheless, he pronounced himself an optimist about Africa's future, saying that the spread of democracy and a new generation of leaders offers hope for &quot;fulfilling the dreams of Africa's greatness that animated the leaders of its independence so many years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
