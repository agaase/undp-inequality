""A full-fledged enquiry has been launched to investigate the matter,"" a police officer told AFP, demanding not to be named. ""A senior police officer will investigate the death of a carpenter who went missing last year after reaching Srinagar from a south Kashmir village,"" the officer said. He said two policemen had been arrested after the questioning of a man who was found with the mobile phone of the carpenter, identified as 35-year-old Abdul Rahman Padder. The victim went missing last December immediately after arriving at Srinagar, the summer capital of the Himalayan state. A report in the Indian Express newspaper said Padder was arrested by police in Srinagar and then later passed off as a Pakistani militant killed in a gunbattle in a neighbouring district. The case has reached the state assembly where Kashmir legislators have demanded ""stern action"" against the police if the officers are found guilty. Police are also probing the disappearance of two more villagers who had travelled to Srinagar in the past year that may have met the same fate as Padder, the Express said. Allegations of fake gunbattles between security forces and separatist militants in Kashmir have been frequent since an insurgency against Indian rule was launched in 1989 that has left thousands dead. Human Rights Watch last year said that Indian security officials have for the first time privately admitted to killing suspects in fake gunbattles. A federal probe finished in 2006 said Indian troops killed five civilians in a fake encounter and later dubbed the dead men as militants involved in the massacre of 37 Kashmiri Sikhs in March 2001 in southern Kashmir. [note: he went missing 8 December]. (AFP, 2007-02-01): Police in revolt-hit Indian Kashmir arrested two top officers Saturday on murder charges after a carpenter was allegedly falsely identified as an insurgent and shot dead, an official said. The arrest came a day after the Indian Kashmir government promised to use an ""iron hand"" against police who kill civilians and claim they are rebels in the hope of getting rewards or promotions. Senior Superintendent of Police Hans Raj Parihar and his deputy, Bahadur Ram, were being held on charges of kidnap and murder involving the alleged ""fake encounter,"" a police officer told AFP, asking not to be named. Parihar heads the counter-insurgency Special Operations Group in Gandherbal district near Srinagar, summer capital of Indian Kashmir where an Islamic separatist insurgency against New Delhi's rule has raged since 1989. (PTI via BBC, 2007-02-04): The custodial disappearances of five persons came to light when police investigating the case of Paddar found that ASI Farooq Ahmad Gudoo had given the carpenter's mobile phone to a person at Hajan in Bandipora area. The carpenter had gone missing from Batmaloo in Srinagar on 8 December last year when he was with Farooq Ahmad Paddar, a police constable from his native Larnoo village. The next day, the SOG and 42nd battalion of the CRPF registered a first information report (FIR) in Shadipora police station that said they had killed Pakistani militant Abu Hafiz of Multan in a gun battle and recovered an AK assault rifle and some ammunition. However, as soon as the body said to be of Hafiz was exhumed on Thursday, Paddar's father immediately identified him as his missing son. In the second case, Nazir Ahmad Deka, also a resident of Kokernag, went missing from Lal Chowk in Srinagar on 16 February, 2006. The next day, the SOG in Ganderbal and troops of 5 Rashtriya Rifles filed an FIR in Ganderbal police station claiming to have killed a foreign militant at Saloora. Deka's body was identified by his kin on exhumation on Friday. An imitation perfume bottle was found on the body, leaving little doubt that the dead man was Deka as he used to sell such merchandise on the city's streets. During its probe, the SIT found Deka's briefcase in which he stored perfume bottles from the home of ASI Gudoo, who was arrested with Constable Paddar on 30 January. Official sources said besides four policemen, two civilians were arrested for their alleged involvement in the killings. However, officials were tight-lipped about the identity of the arrested civilians, saying the disclosure would hamper investigations. In the third case, the SOG in Ganderbal and 24 Rashtriya Rifles claimed to have killed an unidentified militant at Ganiwan-Ganderbal on march 8, 2006 and showed the recovery of arms and ammunition from him. However, when the SIT exhumed the ""militant's"" body Saturday, the family of Ali Mohammad Paddar of Gagran village in Kokernag identified it as that of their kin who went missing a day earlier. Troops of 24 Rashtriya Rifles participated in another operation with the SOG at Ajas-Bandipora during the intervening night of 13-14 March last year. In the FIR filed in Sumbal police station, they claimed to have shot dead a ""dreaded Pakistani militant"" named Zulfikar. On 13 March, 2006, kin of Ghulam Nabi Wani, a resident of Kokernag, filed a report in Kothibagh police station here saying that he was missing. When the body was exhumed Saturday, Wani's relatives identified it as that of their missing kin by the initials G.N tattooed on his forearm. The fifth case of ""fake encounter killing"" occurred on 5 October, 2006 when troops of 13 Rashtriya Rifles and the SOG claimed to have killed a militant from Karachi in Pakistan named Abu Zahid at Bazipora-Ajas. When the grave of the alleged militant was dug up Saturday as part of the investigation, relatives of a missing cleric, Showkat Ahmad Khattana of Banihal in Doda district, had no doubt that it was their kin who was buried in it after being killed in a fake gun battle. Constable Paddar has appeared as the common link in four of the five cases. Officials said more arrests are likely over the next few days as the SIT has questioned more than a dozen policemen and civilians who might have been linked to the killings. The SIT is also probing the source of arms and ammunition claimed to have been found by security forces on the dead ""militants"". It is suspected that rogue elements in the SOG and other forces were putting away some arms and ammunition seized during genuine operations for use in such incidents, sources said. (AFP, 2007-02-22): An alleged militant who security forces claimed was killed in a gunbattle in Indian Kashmir last year was instead ""beyond doubt"" a small-town carpenter killed in custody, police said Thursday. Police said the man, who was exhumed from an unmarked grave in Kashmir this month for DNA tests to determine his identity, belonged to a family that had claimed him missing, and was not a militant as claimed by security forces. ""The DNA samples taken from a body have matched with those of the carpenter's relatives, proving beyond doubt that he was killed in custody and later declared a militant,"" a police officer told AFP. The victim, Abdul Rahman Padder, was reportedly detained in the summer capital, Srinagar, in December 2006. He was killed and later described by police as a Pakistani militant. (AFP, 2007-02-23): DNA testing has proved that a body claimed to be that of an Islamic militant killed by security forces in Indian Kashmir was that of an innocent Muslim cleric, police said Friday. It was the second time in as many days that police admitted civilians had been killed in ""fake encounters"" or staged executions. The cases have sparked major protests in Indian Kashmir after years of repeated charges by human rights groups that security forces were executing civilians not involved in the uprising against Indian rule. DNA tests conducted on the body matched with the relatives of cleric Shaukat Ahmed who went missing in the summer capital Srinagar last October, police said. (AP, 2007-03-09): Authorities arrested a policeman and a Muslim cleric who allegedly took part in the killing of a civilian in Indian-controlled Kashmir and claimed the dead man was an Islamic militant to collect reward money, police said Friday. The arrests Thursday were the latest detentions in connection with a spreading scandal over police and soldiers allegedly staging fake gunbattles with civilians, and then claiming the people killed were militants to earn rewards and gain promotions. ""The special investigation team arrested a police constable and a cleric for their alleged involvement in the abduction and murder of a civilian,"" said Farooq Ahmed, the police officer heading the investigations. Tariq Lone, the police officer, is alleged to have taken part in the killing of Showkat Ahmed Kataria, a 28-year-old cleric in a mosque in Srinagar, the main city in India's Jammu-Kashmir state. The arrested cleric, Mohammed Ashraf, is suspected of helping abduct Kataria, Ahmed said. Kataria was reportedly picked up by the police's special operations squad in October and shot dead at Ajas, 45 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Srinagar. At the time, police identified Kataria as an unidentified Pakistani militant of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba, one of the main militant groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir. Authorities reopened the case after holes appeared in the police story and Kataria's body was exhumed. DNA tests confirmed his identity. (Reuters, 2007-03-23): An Indian state government admitted on Friday its police killed an innocent Muslim man in a staged gun battle known as a ""false encounter"" in 2005, wrongly accusing him of plotting to kill its chief minister. Sohrabuddin Sheikh was shot dead by Gujarat's anti-terrorist squad in a controversial shooting on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, the state's main city. His wife has been missing ever since. That original news that a Muslim plotted to assassinate Narendra Modi, Gujarat's top politician, caused apprehension among Muslims at the time, worried it could spark a backlash against their community in the state. Police claimed Sheikh was an activist of the banned Kashmiri militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba and was plotting to kill Modi to avenge the death of hundreds of Muslims in the 2002 riots. ""It was a false encounter,"" senior counsel for Gujarat, K.T.S Tulsi, told a three-judge bench at the Supreme Court headed by the chief justice. ""Senior police officers are involved. We are prepared to take immediate action,"" he added. The counsel sought some time to take action against the officers which the court granted. (Reuters, 2007-04-12): Indian authorities in Kashmir charged five soldiers and five policemen on Thursday with killing a Muslim cleric in a staged gun battle and passing him off as a separatist militant, police said. Security forces in the troubled Himalayan region have been accused of shooting civilians in staged gun battles to earn rewards and promotions for killing militants. ""The accused were charged with hatching a criminal conspiracy, abduction, murder and destruction of evidence,"" a police official said. In February, five bodies, including the cleric Molvi Shoukat Khatana, were exhumed in connection with investigations into charges of staged gun battles. (Reuters, 2007-04-24): Two policemen were arrested in the western Indian state of Gujarat on Tuesday on charges that they killed a Muslim man in a staged gun battle, wrongly accusing him of plotting to kill its chief minister. Sohrabuddin Sheikh was shot dead by Gujarat's anti-terrorist squad in 2005 in a controversial shooting on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, the state's main city. His wife has since been missing. ""Deputy Inspector-General of police D.G. Vanzara and Superintendent of Police Rajkumar Pandian have been arrested on charges of murder,"" said Sudhir Sinha, a senior state police officer. They were suspected of killing Sheikh with no concrete evidence and were unable to justify their action, he said. Police had claimed Sheikh was a member of Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba and was plotting to kill Narendra Modi, the Hindu nationalist leader of the state, to avenge the death of hundreds of Muslims in religious riots in 2002. But last month, the state government, in reply to a petition by Sheikh's brother in the Supreme Court, admitted the gun battle was fake and said fresh investigations had been ordered. (Reuters, 2007-05-07): Three policemen were arrested in India's Gujarat state on Monday for the 2005 murder of a Muslim man, taking to six the number of officers detained in the case which centres on an unproved assassination plot. Three senior police officers have already been arrested for the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh, wrongly accused of planning to kill Gujarat's chief minister in revenge for deadly attacks on Muslims during religious riots in 2002. (Reuters, 2007-07-18): Thirteen policemen in India have been charged with murdering a Muslim couple and passing the husband's corpse off as that of an Islamist militant to advance their careers and earn rewards. Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kauser Bi were riding aboard a bus when they were picked up by police from the western state of Gujarat in November 2005. They were taken to a farmhouse on the outskirts of Ahmedabad city where, over an unknown period of time, they were tortured and eventually killed, according to the chargesheet obtained by Reuters. The policemen pretended Sheikh was a member of the outlawed Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) who was plotting to assassinate the state's chief minister, and that they had killed him in a gun battle, according to the chargesheet. The case has made headlines in India, highlighting what rights groups say is a common method by corrupt police in many parts of India to earn praise and money. Bi's body -- not needed in the charade -- was secretly burnt, according to the chargesheet. ""The police killed the two without any concrete evidence against them,"" the chargesheet filed in a Gujarat trial court on Monday said. ""All investigations prove it as an act of personal glory by the police."" A copy of the chargesheet was only made available to Reuters late on Tuesday night. The thirteen policemen, including D.G. Vanzara, the suspended deputy inspector general of Gujarat police, are charged with murder, criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, wrongful confinement and destroying evidence. Lawyers for the policemen said they had no comment on the charges. The Gujarat government admitted in the Supreme Court in March this year that police killed Sheikh knowing he was not a terrorist. The court ordered Gujarat police to carry out a new investigation. Investigators found that while Sheikh was a petty criminal involved in an extortion racket, his killers had no evidence he was linked with LeT, a police official told Reuters, who spoke on condition of anonymity.","Jammu and Kashmir State",,"33.91667","76.66667","POINT (76.666670 33.916670)","178354","India","Asia","1","1","2006-12-31","2006-12-31","0","0","4","0","4","4","4","IND","750","IND"
