<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - Aspirants for election into the boards of the 24 associations under the ministry of youth and sports position themselves for the task, which must be completed by February 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the board last week, there were intense jostling in the 25 sporting associations as contestants into their executive councils primed their arsenals in readiness for the elections, the guidelines of which were released January 13.  Some of the aspirants, however, believe that the guidelines are no different from those used to conduct elections into the board of the Nigerian Football Association in September last year. For instance, they point out that as was the case with the NFA, of the 15 members on the board of each association, seven will come from the seven sports zones of the country. This, in the opinion of Ayo Ositelu, former Lagos State chairman of the lawn tennis association and current board member at the national level, may lead to a selection process in which money will determine who emerges.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ositelu, who last week declared his intention to serve again on the board of the Nigeria Lawn Tennis Association, believes that as a result of this provision in the election guidelines, &quot;by and large, government candidates will emerge as the helmsmen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by far the more contentious provision in the guidelines is that which disregards the courts and makes the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports the final arbiter in disputes emanating from the elections. Rotimi Obajimi, ex- athletics international, believes that rather than make itself the final arbiter, the ministry should have borrowed a leaf from the International Amateur Athletics Federation. According to him, the IAAF has a body of legal- minded jurists who adjudicate in matters of this nature. Ositelu, on his part, believes that while it is not healthy for the ministry to assume such a role especially as it concerns an election which guidelines it drafted, the clause is necessary if the bureaucracy must free itself from court cases which often impede sports development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having carefully studied the guidelines, Ositelu does not see much difference between the new system of electing association board members and what obtained in the past when government merely appointed people into association boards. He is right, for the ministry maintains absolute control on the election process and is the only body that can ratify the final results. With such powers, &quot;the government has a right to annul an election if it is unhappy with the outcome,&quot; Ositelu remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such complaints notwithstanding, sports administrators have been busy mapping out strategies to help them win election or secure nomination into the boards. Obajimi, who has his eyes on the exalted post of chairman of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria, says that his gameplan is to work through the zones to get elected into the board. &quot;It is after that, that we can begin to talk of getting into the chairmanship race,&quot; he tells Theweek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he succeeds in getting into the board, the one-time national coach will find formidable opponents in Abdulkareem Amu, the incumbent chairman, and Smart Akraka, who reigned briefly before Amu staged a comeback in 1995. While both Amu and Akraka attempt to sort themselves out based on old rivalries, smooth-talking Obajimi who reportedly endeared himself to the athletics community by his impressive records as an athlete, a coach and an administrator, may just sneak in and carry the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The time may also have finally come for David Johnson, former vice-chairman of the Nigeria Amateur Boxing Association, to finally ascend the throne as chairman. After being disqualified by the Sola Rhodes-led National Sports Commission during the 1995 elections, Johnson, former chairman of the Plateau State Sports Council, went to court. He was later persuaded to withdraw his suit by Jim Nwobodo, the sports minister, who promised to conduct fresh elections. Another court order, however, scuttled the minister's plans and Ademola Farri, elected in the 1995 polls, reigned on. But Farri's tenure was crisis-ridden, leading to its dissolution. As a result, when the country's contingent left for the Olympic Games mid last year, boxing was the only association without a board. Nigeria's woeful outing in the sport in 1996 is one evidence that a change is highly desired in the leadership of NABA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Obajimi and Johnson may have to first face the zonal challenge, Ositelu, a veteran sports commentator, is hopeful of government nomination.  Even then, &quot;I won't lobby for it,&quot; he says. &quot;I know what I have done for sports and they know too. I can't afford presents or hampers for anybody. In fact, I don't believe in such things. I prefer it (his nomination) comes by merit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Ositelu eventually returns to the lawn tennis board, the former sports editor of Punch newspapers will have to work extra-hard to displace Chuka Momah, the incumbent chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in athletics and lawn tennis, intense tussles between the incumbent and some younger administrators who desire to get to the top seem imminent in other associations. This is in line with the thinking in sports circles that only contestants who have paid their dues as athletes and coaches, and therefore can fully appreciate the import of their actions or inactions in office, are best suited to lead the associations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - The Nigerian Football Association and the sports ministry are gearing up for the unemployment of a technical adviser for the national teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our Players in big clubs in Europe and they equally need a better coach in the national team. I assure you that we've concluded everything and the technical adviser will be named before the end of the month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was a thundering Jim Nwobodo, the sports minister, January 14 asking the Nigerian Football Association to either employ a foreign coach to take over the rest of Nigeria's qualifying matches to France '98 or risk the ministry naming one for the association.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exactly one week into the minister's ultimatum, Abdulmumini Aminu, NFA chairman, is now appealing for an extension. Hear the retired former military governor of Borno State: &quot;We will suggest to the minister... that it would not be possible to have one in two weeks. We will appeal for an extension. We must wait and take the best. What we are talking about is for national interest because whatever we do is for the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aminu's seeming procrastination appears to be a product of his experiences in the few weeks that he has called the shots from Ogunlana Drive. Here was a chairman who came into office at a time when Nigeria's football was at its glorious peak. He had, also, hardly settled down in office when confronted with the Jo Bonfere crisis. The Dutchman had refused to return home with the Dream Team, which he had piloted, to an unprecedented Olympic soccer glory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of other unresolved crises, sports reporters had asked Aminu if his administration would consider signing on a replacement for Bonfere. The new chairman replied, asking the newshounds to be patient and give the local coaches, He further pledged to adequately support the trio in their efforts to ensure success for their respective categories. He even matched his word with action November 9, last year, when he authorised that Amodu be paid a $6, 000 match bonus, double what his boys received when they beat Burkina Faso 2- 0 in Nigeria's first France '98 qualifier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Aminu, however, nothing can be more disappointing than the performance of the local coaches.  Hamilton could not find the wherewithal to push the Flying Eagles to the finals of the world age-grade championships, later this year. Amodu's performance in Nairobi, Kenya January 12 was hardly better.  Coming at a time all hopes for revival of Nigeria's football were invested on the country appearing in next year's world cup finals, the January 12 draw against the Harambee Stars was taken as an equivalent of defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nwobodo's January 14 directive, viewed against this background of poor outings, becomes instructive. The sports minister, sources claim, was under pressure from higher quarters to &quot;do something&quot; to arrest the drift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aminu's &quot;plea&quot; to Nwobodo for an extension of time, sources say, has to do with a resolve to ensure that adequate steps are taken to avoid a repeat of the Westerhof and, later, Bonfere experiences. In addition to taking its time to look at their paper credentials, the football house is also said to be seriously vetting the careers of the applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On return from the United States where he finally gave recuperating Kanu Nwankwo the federal government's $50,000 gift, Aminu gave Nigerians a list of six applicants for the technical adviser's job. Surprisingly, the list excludes Ivica Osim, a Yugoslav, Claude Le Roy, a Frenchman and Westerhof, all of whom had enjoyed ample mention in the media as possible favourites for the job. Rather, in the chairman's list were Phillipe Tronssier who for years tutored both club and national team in neighbouring Cote d'Ivoire; Kenny Dalglish, now of Newcastle United, an English premier league side; and Harold Wilkinson, said to be technical director at the English FA. There is also Kalman Meszoley who once called the shots for the Hungarian national team; a German named Dirk Mark and Hansruedi Heiniger, a Swiss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theweek learnt that to avoid the pitfalls of the past, the NFA is likely to contract a private law firm to fashion out an iron-cast terms of employment for the new coach, using the cases of Manfred Hoener, one-time Nigerian coach, Westerhof and Bonfere as &quot;examples of what to avoid.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - Amidst a flurry of official promises, Nigerians are still searching for manna in the 1997 budget. Anthony Ani, the finance minister, says the pudding is in its implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was January 7 and the ministers were already seated for the Federal Executive Council meeting on this year's budget. One minister was conspicuously missing - Anthony Ani, the finance minister and perhaps the most sought after at the crucial meeting. When he finally strolled into the Council Chambers, Aso Rock venue of the meeting, the ministers instinctively rose to give him a rousing applause for, in the opinion of the cabinet members, the impeccable manner he managed the economy the previous year. The day before, Ani had enthusiastically informed State House correspondents that the then-to-released 1997 budget would literally put food on the table of every Nigerian.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if on cue, the three spokesmen who addressed the press at the end of the FEC. Council of States and Provisional &quot;manna-from-heaven&quot; promise. Based on this, the anxiety that preceded the budget broadcast amongst Nigerians was understandable. But, by 8.05 a.m. Saturday, January 18 when Sani Abacha, the head of state, had finished his nationwide broadcast on the budget, many Nigerians thought the promise remains a dream, that Abacha's &quot;real&quot; broadcast was yet to come. Their unbelief stemmed from the fact that they could seemingly not sign post any issue in the broadcast that had a pretense of lifting their battered souls.  Worse, two issues that dominated media reports last December - the merger of the dual exchange rates and privatization of government parastatals - and on which most Nigerians hung their hopes, were studiedly played down by the head of state. To demonstrate their absolute belief that at leas a firming up of the naira would bring about substantial reduction in prices of goods and services, Nigerians literally stopped further purchases until the budget broadcast. In fact, dealers in imported goods, fearful of an imminent loss began reducing prices of their goods to attract customers. The building anxiety therefore underscored the nation's disappointment that this singular matter was again returned to the cooler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Premised on this apparent forlorn hope, Ani again came smoking Monday, January 20 when, during his budget breakdown speech, he sought to reassure Nigerians that the economy was accelerating on the track of recovery, growth and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While trying to convince the nation about the prospects of the 1997 fiscal plans, Ani made two points crystal clear. One was that consistency could not be jettisoned for expedience and that government was not done yet with the philosophy of &quot;guided deregulation&quot; which it had adopted since January 1995 as its lane to a market economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ani's explanation on the knotty issues of exchange rate and privatization flew from this base. He said the fiscal policy it adopted had let to a stab le value of the naira for most of last year, which substantially aided planning and hence dual exchange rate. Just like last year, Ani said the ultimate aim of government was to merge the dual exchange rates. While giving last year's breakdown of the budget, he had said that government's aim was to see to the merger of the official exchange rate of N22 to one United States dollar with the autonomous rate that opened at N85 to $1. But what Ani did not offer was the profit motive behind government's reluctance to carry through its promise. For pumping $1.9 billion into the autonomous market last year, government made roughly N62 billion. Were the AFEM rate of N80 to $1 to prevail throughout 1997, government intends to fund the market to the tune of $2.7 billion. But by proposing to earn just N47 billion, there is an expectation that the naira will firm up. Another reason that worked against effecting a merger by fiat was the fear that government business would have suffered immeasurably from high cost. For instance, were the exchange rate fixed at the touted N56 to $1, the N44 billion ($2 billion) government sets aside to service its external debt would have automatically translated to N112 billion (still $2 billion). Based on this calculation, it is apparent that the two exchange rates will not find a meeting point even by December.  But government intends to make the naira appreciate marginally this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On privatization, the minister was a little more forthcoming, though in the build-up to the budget, the impression was created that government parastatals meant for privatization were automatically going to be thrown into the market. It was this expectation that caused the dismay on the budget even within the international community. The much-awaited policy on privatization was underscored by several pronouncements from top government officials indicating its commitment to the programme. The difference being that, in the character of the Abacha administration, the programme must be done at a time that suits only the administration. Expatiating on the imperatives of privatization as a key to expanding investible resources, Ani said government would &quot;expose the potentials for privatising and commercialising a number of state-owned enterprises in order to free the resources tied up in such ventures for social development.&quot; He said this would be done via a committee that would advise the government on the best way to achieve its objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what Ani did not guarantee Nigerians were that the committee would not constitute itself a red tape as virtually all such bodies under this government have; and, more importantly, that the policy would not be bogged down by political considerations Late last year, some interest groups, allegedly from the northern part of the country, felt their grip on power could be in jeopardy were such behemoths as the National Electric Power Authority, Nigerian Telecommunications Plc and Nigerian Ports Plc taken to the stock market. So they had mount pressure on Abacha to apply the breaks.  As it were, the earliest these agencies would be up for sale is 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by far, the greatest quake from the budget visited the financial sector.  Virtually everyone within the sector was affected for good or for ill. Take the Central Bank. It was first asked to go and shed some fat by purging itself of all commercial banking activities before being saddled with new responsibilities. Another area the CBN lost out is that the role of one of its babies - the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation - has been taken away by the now robust Federal Ministry of Finance Incorporated. But the apex bank has been adequately compensated in other ways too. It now has direct control of such institutions as the Development Banks, the People'' Bank, Community Banks and Mortgage Institutions. This is a major step towards intense supervision of the entire financial sector and also a huge indictment of the National Board on community Banks and the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the CBN could not clink glasses as its fight for wholesale autonomy was only half-way achieved. Unfortunately, many misread its reversion to the ministry of finance as a greater loss of autonomy. Fact is, the CBN Decree 24 of 1991 that amended its 1958 Act effectively brought it under the office of the president, a wholly political office, which subjected the CBN governor to the whims of the president.  At the budget breakdown, Mohammadu Haladu, the industries minister, said: &quot;In order to ensure probity and accountability, the CBN should be under the ministry of finance. The whole purpose is to give strength to the CBN.&quot; He may be right. But critics argue that the sandstorm over the controversial mid-year N8 billion surplus where the two organs of government came up with contradictory figures may have led to the ministry. The federal government felt embarrassed by the CBN refutal of the claim on the budget surplus figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the CBN has been well tooled to perform its statutory roles, the same may not be said of the banks. In fact they are in for the worst of times.  Ultimately, government's action on banks this year is a masterstroke to save the financial sector from itself. The new policy may however see many of the institutions falling by the wayside; though this will restore sanity to the prevailing chaos in the system. To be sure, banks certified as seriously distressed have been given up to March 31 to beef up their capital base or risk being liquidated, while all bank have been given 24 months to raise their minimum paid-up capital to N500 million. By all standards, these are tall orders. There are at least 40 banks that fall under the first category and the problem is not so much as being healed of &quot;benign&quot; ailment of recapitalisation but that of the &quot;malignant&quot; obstacle of the new minimum paid- up capital. What this means is that even if some distressed banks could rally up a few million naira by March ending, it would be near impossible to get as much as half a billion naira a few months after. But for the less-distressed and solvent banks, getting up to N500 million will not be a tea party either.  In the budget, government has covertly taken certain steps that may help the surviving banks. The return of commercial banking for government agencies, the repayment of debts owed them by the government and the phased refund of the stabilization securities to banks will raise the banks' level of liquidity this year. There are however fears that even with the full dose of the options, some banks will still be hard-put meeting target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the banks have been given what looked like a lifetime assignment, government seems set to sink its teeth into the real sectors of the economy.  Ani said since 1996, government has been embarking on a reversal of the structural defects in the economy which stifled increased output, job creation and low prices, and that this would be continued this year for the desired result to be achieved. Here, agriculture, the long-forgotten saviour, is staging a come back. To achieve growth and development, government says it can no longer toy with the landing cultivation sector. Incentives such as credit, subsidy and facilities are being dangled before the sector in fiscal 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agricultural rejuvenation is pursued alongside the rural development and empowerment3. The Family Economic Advancement Programme, with a take-off grant of N4.3 billion, is the agency government believes will achieve this.  Equally, the marginal success recorded in last year's exploitation of the mining and solid minerals sectors has given government the fillip to invest more in that sector. Apart from greater incentive here, government says it is further opening up the sectors to private investors, believing that more money could be made from them than from crude oil. Ani boasted that Nigeria as the best coal with the leanest sulfur content in the world and that for the first time in 21 years the country exported the product last year. To give it a boast, a N200 million grant has been given the Nigerian Coal Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The iron and steel sub-sector is also to be pampered this year, just as infrastructural facilities are seen as the hub of growth and development are receiving an unusual attention. Government is staking a huge N34.5 billion, (24.6 percent of the N189 billion federal budget on infrastructural development) in this area of the economy. These are mainly in the areas of water, electricity, health, education, roads, erosion control among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the manufacturing sector can genuinely claim that it may not directly benefit much from fiscal 1997. This, more than any other sector, expected a greater appreciation of the naira which would have translated to lower cost of importation and clearing of goods. This huge loss has feebly been compensated by in-built incentives as the continuous reform of the Ports and Customs a slicing of duty on some goods, streamlining of multiple taxation and the expected improvement in infrastructural facilities which, hopefully will translate to reduced cost of doing business and increase in capacity utilization, employment opportunities and lower rate of inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informed analyst, despite its conservative outlook, views this year's budget as growth inducing and realist. Even by government projection, the economy is expected to grow at 5.5 percent by December, an improvement over the 3.25 percent rate it grew last year. Inflation is expected to peak at 15 percent, an improvement over the 28-percentage point that it reached last December. Government also intends to sustain the macro-economic stability it largely achieved last year. But apart from the attention to agriculture, Nigerians are still wondering how the budget will influence micro-economic variables such as greater job openings and improved purchasing power of Nigerians which were at the core of economic crisis for much of last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the lofty targets are not met, government can hide under the umbrella that budgets are largely intentions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - The death Knell sounds for organised labour following the promulgation of a new decree with far-reaching consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All is not well with the organised labour movement in Nigeria. Within its rank and file, there are grumblings and disenchantment.  The reason is the promulgation of a new decree, which not only clips the wings of the labour movement but also makes it impossible for it to wriggle out of the knotty web of the legal draughtsman.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decree, titled &quot;Trade Union (Amendment) Decree 26 of 1996,&quot; empowers the minister of labour to de-register any trade union not acting in national interest. It also bars professional unionists from contesting elective posts in the Nigeria Labour Congress. The decree further prescribes a five-year jail term or a fine of N100,000 for any person who contravenes its provisions.  And any attempt to seek redress in any law court has been crippled by an ouster clause, which bars any law court from entertaining cases in relation to the decree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the promulgation of Decree 26 of 1996, the independence of trade unions to collective bargaining and freedom of association, as provided for by International Labour Organisation conventions 87 and 98, may have been eroded. It has also checkmated the dream of such labour veterans as Paschal Bafyau, secretary-general of the Nigerian Labour Union of Railwaymen, and Adam Oshomole, secretary-general of textile workers union, to contest the presidency of the NLC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The labour movement in Nigeria has been reeling under the jackboot of government interference since the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria staged a nationwide strike in 1994 to protest the annulment of the June 12 1993 presidential election. As a result, the government resolved to decapitate the workers' unions. In one such attempt last year, a plan to fully democratise the central union ran into a stone wall as a result of government's alleged determination to ensure that only such people that are sympathetic to it are elected into the various offices of the NLC. After a series of merger talks and elections at the primary level, Decree 4 of 1996 was rolled out, allegedly at the instance of Uba Ahmed, the labour minister.  The high point of the decree is the provision that election would be &quot;limited to card-carrying members.&quot; This, it was gathered, automatically disenfranchises secretaries, since they are appointees and not members of the unions. The textile workers union had then amended its rules to enable Adam Oshomole, its secretary and former deputy president of the NLC, become a card- carrying member and consequently become qualified to run for the election.  The legal manoeuvre has stalled the election, which had been scheduled for April 1996. The elected executive council of the NLC was dissolved along with those NUPENG and PENGASSAN by Decree 28 of 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Yaba office of the NLC, an official who pleaded anonymity told Theweek that the new decree is a &quot;most awkward and undesirable law at a time like this.&quot; He added that &quot;one would have thought that the government would realise the need to court the goodwill of the labour movement rather than kill it completely.&quot; Theweek gathered that Ahmed Gusau, the sole administrator of NLC, was away to Abuja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And at Textile Workers Union building along ACME Road, Ogba, Lagos, a source told Theweek that the government might have realised its objective of muzzling the labour movement which is seen as another bastion of opposition.  This action, the source said, will only compound the federal government's problems with the international community, which already has a low opinion of the present administration on account its poor human rights record. Another official, A.B. Dania, a senior deputy general secretary, declined comment but offered the telephone numbers of Adams Oshomole, said to be away to Kaduna.  Dania insisted that Oshomole is the only competent person that can comment on the new development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new decree has opened a new chapter in the history of organised labour in the country. But the question of when Ahmed will first invoke the spirit of the new law is left in the womb of time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - Growing indifference to the Nigerian situation by the Western powers and apparent reluctance by the new secretary-general of the United Nations to take on the Sani Abacha government dampen the morale of activist amidst fresh hints that the head of state may transmute into a civilian president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It showed in everything about him. As Kola, first son of Moshood Abiola, presumed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, arrived the courtroom at 8.45 a.m. last Tuesday, he was in full spirits. If anything, the way he conducted himself gave the impression of a man almost sure that the judgment on government's appeal against a federal high court ruling that his father be produced in court to untie the legal chain over his choice of counsel in his treasonable felony trial would be favourable. Dressed in a resplendent black suit with a red dotted shirt and matching shoes, Kola had on alighting from his white Mercedes Benz S-Class car discussed light heartedly with A.O. Jagun, the lawyer standing in for Rotimi Williams, a senior advocate and his choice as leading counsel for his father. He then took his seat and awaited the good news.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it were, Kola's ego was soon deflated. In the unanimous judgment which lasted barely 30 minutes, Umaru Kalgo, leading two other justices of the Abuja Appeal Court, ruled that it was not proper for Chrisanthine Senlong of the Federal High Court, Abuja, to order Ibrahim Coomassie, inspector-general of police, and the Abuja police commissioner, to produce Abiola in court to make a choice on who, between Rotimi Williams and G.O.K. Ajayi, another senior advocate, should represent him in the treasonable felony charge brought against him for allegedly declaring himself president on account of the voided election of 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 31-page judgment, Kalgo stated that the order to produce Abiola in court to choose his counsel was not properly given. He pointed out that there was no prima facie evidence tendered at the lower court by Williams to warrant an order for Abiola to be produced in court to identify his counsel.  To discountenance the order made for the production of Abiola in court over the matter, Kalgo cited section 53 of the Federal High Court Act. Quoting from the Act, he said that &quot;a judge may issue a warrant under his hand for bringing up any person confirmed as a prisoner under any sentence or order of commitment for trial, provided that court warrant shall not be granted as of course, unless the judge shall have probable grounds for believing that the evidence of the prisoner is likely to prove material.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Kalgo ruled that the court warrant issued by the Federal High Court, Abuja, on May 6, 1996 for the police to produce Abiola in court expired two days after it was issued. This, he said, was because, two days later when the order on the warrant was to be executed, Senlong failed to reactivate the warrant since it was not acted upon, but acted contrary to the law by issuing a court order compelling Coomassie to produce Abiola in court on May 10. Kalgo ruled that since the warrant was not executed on the day it was ordered, coupled with the fact that Tobechukwu Onwugbufor, solicitor- general of the federation and leading prosecutor in the Abiola case, had denied any knowledge of the warrant, and given the absence of Ajayi whose presence was required in court for Abiola to make a rightful choice of counsel, it was improper for Senlong to have issued an order of compliance on the police. The appeal court judge consequently thumbed down Senlong for describing the failure of the police to produce Abiola in court on May 8 as &quot; executive rascality&quot; and &quot;executive disobedience.&quot; He observed that &quot;there is no other prayer in the motion asking for the issue of a warrant for the production of the respondent in court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the tussle between Williams and Ajayi over who qualifies to serve as counsel to Abiola, Kalgo, drawing support from order 17 of the rules of the Federal High Court, stated that such a matter should be discountenanced as there was no request made asking the High Court to strike out Ajayi as counsel to Abiola. As he put it, &quot;it is very clear from the motion before the trial court that the issue of representation in that court was not an issue to be determined by the court. What the respondent's counsel prayed for was for his name and that of another senior counsel to be entered as legal practitioners for the respondent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the turn of events last week, one of the options left for the Abiola family is to proceed to the Supreme Court, an action which could tantamount to a wild goose chase capable of further keeping Abiola, who was arrested on June 23, 1994, in detention without trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kola's deep feeling of disappointment as he left the Federal Court of Appeal, Abuja, compares equally with that of pro-democracy and human rights campaigners in the country. But whereas the young man's sorrow is occasioned by his father's plight, that of the activists goes far beyond to include the attitude of the United Nations, particularly the United States, and European nations towards the Nigerian situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of the US, the first indication that the &quot;policeman of the world&quot; might have softened its stance on Nigeria came on November 19, 1994.  That Saturday evening, the cream of Nigeria's pro-democracy and human rights crusaders had gathered in the official residence of Walter Carrington, the American ambassador to Nigeria, to explore ways to get the Western powers, especially the US to increase the pressure on the Abacha regime. There to ostensibly compare notes with Beko Ransome-Kuti, the now-incarcerated chairman of the Campaign for Democracy, Frederick Fasheun, currently in detention, Olisa Agbakoba, Femi Falana, Olabiyi Durojaiye and Abraham Adesanya, among other top activists, was a visiting six-member American congressional delegation. Led by Harry Johnston, a Democrat from Florida and chairman of the House of Representatives sub-committee on Africa, the delegation included Alice Hastings of Georgia, Floyd Flake of New York, William Jefferson (Louisana), Donald Payne (New Jersey) and Cynthia Mickinnwy (Georgia), all members of the American Lower House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the height of the clamour for Abiola to be released from detention and sworn in as president and expectations were high that the US would help to resolve the political logjam in the country. For the activists gathered in Carrington's house in Lagos, however, it was an evening of disappointment, as the visiting Americans surprisingly took sides with the government, preferring to give support to the constitutional conference set up five months earlier to draw up a constitution for the country. Flustered by the unexpected development, Agbakoba and then the other pro-democracy and human rights crusaders sauntered out of the envoy's house to reflect on the meaning of it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if to reaffirm their support for the conference, Johnston, who had on June 14, 1994 co-authored a two-page letter to Warren Christopher, at the time American secretary of state, asking the Bill Clinton administration to take diplomatic action to restore democracy in Nigeria, said at a world press conference that same evening of November 19 that following a meeting they had with various members of the conference, they felt that &quot;a document could come forth from it,&quot; that is, the conference. He assured that they had a commitment from General Abacha that the document would not be interfered with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years after, the official position of the US government to the Nigerian problem remains a far cry from what it was from the annulment of the 1993 presidential election, to the trial of the alleged coup plotters and the hasty execution of the nine Ogoni nationalists. Following the election annulment, the Clinton administration, barely few months in office, was in the vanguard of calls for sanctions against Nigeria to force its military government to walk the path of democracy. Matching words with action, the US government quickly slammed limited sanctions on Nigeria. The anti-Nigeria stance by the country reached a crescendo following the conviction by a secret military tribunal of the alleged coup plotters including Olusegun Obasanjo and Shehu Yar'Adua in July 1995, and the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa with eight other Ogoni rights champions four months later. On both occasions, the US had joined other countries and international bodies such as the Commonwealth of Nations, European Union and United Nations to express outrage against the Abacha regime. Indeed, in reaction to the execution of the Ogoni Nine, Carrington, like many other envoys flew back home &quot; for consultations.&quot; He returned early last year and since then the Clinton administration has grown progressively indifferent to the situation in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Nigeria is one of the largest suppliers of oil to the US, the National Democratic Coalition, as well as other activists, have consistently campaigned for a boycott of Nigeria's oil as the best way to hurt the economy and bring the military regime to its knees. The pressure has not only been in vain, but the US has continued to warm up to the Abacha administration to the discomfiture of pro-democracy and human rights groups. The frustration in the ranks of the activists was poignantly illustrated last week when a NADECO top shot in exile in the US in a telephone conversation with a colleague in Nigeria lamented bitterly about America's attitude towards the Nigerian situation. According to him, the Clinton administration has developed cold feet in the current crusade to get Abacha's government to march to democracy, release Abiola, Obasanjo, Yar'Adua and others wrongly convicted or detained, as well as respect fundamental human rights. Unwittingly, echoing the sentiments of the NADECO exile, Ayo Adebanjo, a NADECO chieftain in Lagos, regretted last week that US has not taken any clear step to help Nigerians out of their predicament. Adebanjo, who regained his freedom after months of detention, last year, told Theweek that there has not been anything like a definite plan by the US to free those detained unjustly by the regime. He noted that the country's response to the Nigerian crisis has only been at the level of condemnation of human rights abuse and lack of democracy in black Africa's most populous nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Innocent Chukwuma who coordinates the international lobby project at the Civil Liberties Organisation, told Theweek that there is no US policy on Nigeria apart from occasional statements by congressmen and government officials. Noting that oil sanction is the most potent instrument to whip Abacha's regime back to line. Chukwuma lamented that the US does not always want to take the lead in matters concerning Nigeria. Said the CLO top shot: &quot;It (US) rather concedes the lead to Britain, perhaps out of the feeling that being our colonial masters, Britain will know the terrain better.  &quot; Chukwuma identified as an impediment, the fact that once it comes to issues pertaining to Nigeria, the US usually talks about the need to act in concert with other countries, as against the kind of unilateral actions which it takes in other countries all over the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the benefit of hindsight, Nigerian activists are not placing any premium on the words of Madeline Albright, who when answering questions in the Senate while defending her nomination as the secretary of state for the next four years, said that Clinton &quot;is concerned about what happens in Nigeria and is actively considering a number of options, including a variety of sanctions.&quot; Theweek found that in diplomatic as well as pro-democracy and human rights circles, Albright's assurance that the American government would intervene in Nigeria's political crisis is viewed as vague and bound to end up at the level of rhetorics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the circumstance, activists both at home and abroad are mourning mutely the almost certain shattering of their hope that there would be some decisive action against the Abacha regime during Clinton's second term in office as president. Last week one prominent activist spoke of how he and his colleagues had banked heavily on Clinton's second term in the expectation that, contrary to the situation during his first four years in office, he would feel free to act since he would not be seeking election again and so would not need to fear reprisals by voters who might feel that he was paying too much attention to foreign issues. The activist alluded to the current thinking in America which favours pre-occupation with domestic issues. He said that indications were that Clinton, who began his fresh mandate after being sworn in last Monday, may feel that so long as there is peace in Nigeria, even though a false one, there may be no need to worry about the political situation in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reflecting the new thinking in the pro-democracy community, Adebanjo said last week that America would not take any step beyond what it has already done. He regretted that while the US is contented with pressurising the Abacha regime to genuinely democratise and respect human rights, the regime is not a listening one. Corroborating Adebanjo, Ayo Akinbobola, a teacher of international relations at the University of Lagos, said that Clinton is not likely to take more action against Abacha's government, having already imposed limited sanctions on Nigeria. &quot;Nigeria&quot; he said, &quot;is one of those countries suffering for not democratising. It is not receiving official assistance because it falls within the defined scope in which those not democratising are found.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akinbobola, a former information commissioner in Ondo State, said that Clinton's failure to decisively act against Nigeria is understandable considering the presidential system of government. He explained that even if Clinton as a person may be willing to do more, the US president is seriously checked by the congress and that, in any case, the resources to execute any decision taken must be approved by the congress. Said the international relations lecturer: &quot;The congress, dominated, not by the ruling Democratic Party but by the more conservative Republican which controls the purse, will not allow the president to spend money without question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what may be considered a double tragedy, the UN appears not prepared to take a definite position on Nigeria. Attempts to convince Kofi Annan, the new UN secretary-general, to bring the country's plight to the front burner were said to have ended in frustration. One of the attempts, Theweek learnt, was by some activists who reached out to Annan, seeking to convince the new UN scribe to prompt the world body to give the Nigerian crisis prime attention.  The activists specifically requested the UN to intervene in the continued detention of Abiola and imprisonment of alleged coup plotters such as Obasanjo, former head of state, and his erstwhile deputy Yar'Adua, both considered as friends of the West. Annan was said to have confessed that he is not prepared to risk his tenure on Nigeria. As if to underscore this, Annan said in an interview published last week that the UN would assist Nigeria in the implementation of the on-going transition programme if such request is made by the government to it. According to Annan, he would assist in whatever way as &quot;that is how we (UN) normally operate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new secretary-general disclosed that he supported what Boutros Boutros- Ghali, his predecessor, did by choosing the path of dialogue, indicating that he would continue with it. Apparently under pressure, Boutros-Ghali had last year reluctantly despatched a four-man UN fact finding team headed by Koffi Amega, a former Togolese foreign minister, to Nigeria in connection with the execution of the nine Ogoni nationalists and the controversial transition programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the team had earlier described the human rights situation in the country as terrible and the political situation as terrifying, its 24-page report surprisingly gave the regime a clean bill of health. The report stated that the transition programme seemed genuine and warned against further sanctions on Nigeria. Analysts expect the US policy towards Nigeria to largely reflect the UN thinking, given the level of support the new secretary- general enjoys from the Clinton's administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the international community relapsing into cold indifference except for occasional tantrums by some influential countries, organisations and individuals, the stage may be set for the Abacha administration to maneuver things whatever way it wants. So far, the regime has rebuffed persistent appeals to release prisoners of conscience while its commitment to the transition programme remains suspect. Since the unfolding of the transition programme in October 1995, little has been done to inspire confidence in the project slated for completion in October 1, 1998. As the implementation set sail early last year, there came avoidable hitches, hinting on a possible extension of the life of the regime. Aside from the March zero-party council polls, which took place as scheduled, activities meant for other quarters had to be carried forward. For instance, the creation of states and local government areas originally billed for the second quarter never came until the third quarter of the year. Similarly, the party-based council polls fixed for the last quarter of the year had to be shifted to the first quarter of this year. As at now, the compilation of an authentic voters register scheduled for last year is yet to be concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than inject some credibility into the transition programme, the registration of the five political parties last September 30 has boosted speculations that Abacha may transform to a civilian leader. Mohammed Bello, former chief justice of the federation, kicked off the debate over the eligibility of the head of state to participate in the 1998 presidential race when in August, he cleared off the legal and constitutional fog thought to debar Abacha from contesting if he so wishes. As if taking a cue, a myriad of groups and individuals, including top government officials, joined in campaigning for, or speaking in favour of, an Abacha candidacy. Among such groups is the Kaduna-based National Tranquility Movement led by one Mohammed Gashash. The movement claims that Abacha has brought hope to Nigerians and therefore should be supported if Nigerians want him to continue in office.  Down South in Lagos, another group known as the National Youth Consultative Forum has also emerged. Headed by Abimbola Davies of the defunct Association for Better Nigeria which played an inglorious role in aborting democracy in 1993, the NYCF says that an Abacha presidency is necessary because &quot;Nigerian politicians are disoriented, weak, visionless and lack the zeal to arrest the drifting political situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the top government officials who have declared support for Abacha's presidency is Abdulkareem Adisa, works and housing minister. Adisa recently declared that the head of state remains the best material for president, stressing that he is &quot;the only person serving today with more experience.&quot; On his part, Ishaya Bamaiyi, chief of army staff, has noted that it is not a crime for somebody in uniform to run for an election if allowed by the constitution. Said he: &quot;If the constitution allows one in uniform to contest and I contest and win, is that a crime?&quot; According to the army chief, the Nigerian constitution is very clear on the issue and the major qualification to contest is that one must be a Nigerian. Among the latest contributors to the debate is Maryam Abacha, the First Lady, who does not see anything wrong in &quot;anybody who has the capability and the capacity and the will and the wish to assume the responsibility of keeping his country together.&quot; Speaking specifically on the chances of her husband seeking election, the First Lady said: &quot;I do not see anything wrong in that if he wishes. If he says he wants to retire and if it is the will of God, let it be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather paradoxically, since the registration of the five political parties, many of their leaders have been trying to outwit each other in their bid to woo Abacha. Observers are already saying that it should not be a surprise if at the end of the day Abacha turns out to be the only candidate for the presidential election. Given their alleged close links with the government, fears have been expressed that the parties may successfully lure Abacha to exploit the single candidate clause in the 1995 draft constitution. Section 36 sub-section A of the draft constitution states that a candidate for an election to the office of the president shall be deemed to have been duly elected to such office where being the only candidate for the election: (a) he has a majority of yes or no votes cast at the election, and (b) he has not less than one-third of the votes cast at the election in each of at least two thirds of all the states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If in the end Abacha chooses to join the race, can he be stopped by the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria ? The possibility, going by the explanation of Sumner Dagogo-Jack, the NECON chairman, is remote. As Dagogo- Jack told a group of American journalists two weeks ago, his commission does not have the power as spelt out in Decree 3 of 1996, to dictate to anybody whether to stand for election or not. He explained that political parties are solely responsible for picking their candidates, who would then be subjected to screening by NECON.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, all that remains is for Abacha, who last November reassured the nation that the military would go in 1998, to indicate his interest to contest. The general seems to have everything going for him. The field has already been shorn of political heavyweights who, frustrated by the non- registration of their political associations, have jumped out of the transition boat. The Failed Banks Tribunal is also taking its toll on some money bag politicians and, with the Failed Contracts and Parastatals Decree on the way, more politicians who would possibly pose a threat to the head of state may well come under the hammer. While giving the 1997 budget breakdown in Abuja last Monday, Anthony Ani, the finance minister, revealed that the decree giving legal teeth to the tribunal took effect from January this year.  Another development, which has fuelled speculations that Abacha may transform into a civilian president, was the unfolding of a long-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">term economic programme called Vision 2010. Modeled after the economic programme of undemocratic, but industrialised, Asian countries, the committee to lay the foundation for the project was inaugurated late last year and is currently at work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to the air of distrust surrounding the transition programme, even well-intentioned populist initiatives by government aimed to ease the hardship facing the vast majority of Nigerians are being seen by critics as a design to &quot;bribe&quot; the masses to back an Abacha presidency. Chief among these initiatives is the Petroleum Trust Fund established in 1995 and charged with helping to make the roads motorable, drugs available in the hospitals, food on the table of Nigerians while equally tackling the problems of the education sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the real masterstroke of the regime may yet be the just introduced Family Economic Advancement Programme aimed at increasing the tempo of economic activities in the rural areas thereby curtailing rural-urban migration, especially among younger, able-bodied men and women. &quot;The programme,&quot; Abacha said in his budget broadcast on January 18, &quot;is aimed at facilitating the setting up of productive cottage enterprise that will use local labour and locally available raw materials and locally fabricated equipment in the rural areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With such programmes bearing modest fruits and the opposition with its back against the wall following Thursday's revelation by the police that it had iron-cast proof that NADECO is behind the bomb blasts in the country, the government seems set for a rich harvest of public affection. The game may yet be steaming.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REPATRIATION TO RWANDA: * About 2000 refugees are being repatriated per day at the Ruzizi I and II border crossings. Operations are hampered by a lack of trucking capacity. As a result, there are more refugees wanting to repatriate than there is available transport capacity. Furthermore, the Alliance's lengthy and thorough inspections of the refugees' personal property slows the process. (Kigali 405, DART/USAID Field Sitrep *37 1/28/97)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Nearly 8,000 Rwandan children who were separated from their families during the chaotic return of refugees to their homeland have been reunited with their loved ones by the Red Cross.

(Associated Press, 1/31/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SITUATION IN RWANDA: * USAID/DART Field Officer asked NGOs and UN organizations if any new security measures had been implemented. The relief agencies had not received official information concerning incidents earlier in the week. Furthermore, no steps had been taken to formulate a security plan which encompassed both the UN organizations and the NGOs. NGOs have talked about security issues and are devising their own plans and relying on each other for support. (Kigali 405, DART/USAID Field Sitrep *37, 1/28/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* There has been another attack on a Spanish aid organization in Rwanda.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shelter * The Ministry of Rehabilitation and Social Integration presented the government's new policy on resettlement to the international NGO community. The new policy calls for group settlements consisting of 100 - 200 families. Committees headed by the local bourgmestre will be established at the communal level to plan site selection and implementation of the new policy. NGOs may be allowed to complete the rehabilitation of houses where work has already begun; all future shelter work must conform to the new policy...According to the plan, each family will receive a house with land for farming within two kilometers of the house...Whether an NGO would be allowed to complete housing rehabs that had been started would depend on the stage of implementation. In all cases, the local bourgmestre would determine whether an NGO should finish the rehabilitation of a house or abandon it.  (Kigali 441, DART/USAID Field Sitrep *39, 1/30/97)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* According to humanitarian workers in Kisangani, the delivery of food aid to refugees near Lubutu and Shabunda has been seriously hampered by the military's &quot;requisitioning&quot; of private planes and trucks rented to aid agencies. (IRIN Emergency Update *90, 1/31/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rwandan refugees seeking repatriation continue to surface in several locations, mainly in Shaminunu, Bunyakiri and Shabunda (south of Bukavu.) No truck transportation is available from Shaminunu due to poor road conditions, and refugees must walk out to the barrier at the eastern entrance to the forest (Kahuzi Biega National Park) or to Madaka...No NGOs or international organizations have access to Shabunda, so refugees must walk from Shabunda to the border crossing. (Kigali 405, DART/USAID Field Sitrep *37, 1/28/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* At present, the health situation of refugees appears to be deteriorating.  Malaria, dehydration, malnutrition and pneumonia remain the major health problems... NGOs are performing triage on the refugees arriving at the waystations to identify and provide some assistance to the most vulnerable before they reach the border crossing...The push by the Alliance and the GOR to get the refugees to their home communes as quickly as possible means that little assistance can be provided to the traveling refugees.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UNHCR Spokeswoman Pam O'Toole said the order to suspend relief operations in the Lubutu area came Friday from Zairian provincial authorities.

(Voice of America, 1/31/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* ICRC is the only organization working in Bukavu and Uvira focusing on IDPs and vulnerables as well as refugees. All other international organizations in Zaire are principally concerned with refugees...Although UN organizations and NGOs have been invited into Uvira by the Alliance, the ICRC is the only agency with a presence. Uvira was more devastated during the recent fighting and subsequent retreat by the FAZ than Bukavu or other cities in the eastern Zaire border region...The ICRC delegate described the overall health situation in Uvira as &quot;not good&quot;, but not destitute either. ICRC has reestablished five health centers in the outer region and three in the lower region surrounding Uvira. ICRC is also training and equipping personnel in the health posts and hospitals.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SITUATION IN BURUNDI: * The relief community operating in Burundi is concerned that the fuel it needs to conduct humanitarian operations has been held up by the Regional Sanctions Committee...We are concerned that a shortage of fuel is beginning to adversely effect the delivery of vital relief supplies to at-risk groups inside Burundi. (State 18598, 1/31/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* According to UN sources in Burundi, some 75,952 Burundians have returned from Zaire since 24 October 1996. Of these, 56,678 have returned spontaneously to the provinces of Cibitoke, Bubanza, Bujumbura-rurale and Bujumbura-mairie.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A report, released yesterday, by the UN human rights mission in Burundi claimed that the Burundian army is responsible for the massacre of hundreds of women and children in the last two months. It claimed that at least 1,100 people have been killed by either the Burundian military or Hutu rebels in the seven weeks from December 1 to January 22.

After being screened in holding centres in Kigoma approximately 40,000 Zaireans were trucked to Nyaragusu camp, north of Kigoma. This camp is now full leaving some 10,000 Zaire refugees in four holding centres in Kigoma while 800 to 1,500 continue to arrive on a daily basis. According to humanitarian workers their situation is critical. The rate of cholera in Kigoma is also said to have almost doubled. (IRIN Emergency Update *90, 1/31/97)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Having analysed the joint statement made by both the Foreign Ministries of South Africa and Swaziland, COSATU wants to make it clear to both Ministers that it is an independent Federation - it does not take orders from governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU applauds Minister Nzo for acknowledging the autonomy and independence of COSATU. Solidarity knows no borders when trade union rights and human rights are violated. Besides, COSATU's founding principles commit it to international solidarity. Swaziland has ratified some of the ILO conventions and COSATU expects it to live by those same conventions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notion that says the Swaziland Constitutional Review Committee will bring about democracy in that country is rapidly becoming a hopeless dream.  The Swaziland Committee should be reconstituted according to the demands of the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU), namely:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It should be a transparent body committed to an open process;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It should involve ALL stakeholders. The review committee at the moment is a toothless dog that lost its credibility from its inception.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU has not yet taken a decision to blockade Swaziland. We have asked our members to go slow in handling goods from and to Swaziland.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The COSATU National Executive Committee will meeting next week on the 11 &amp; 12 February. Amongst other issues, is the intensification of COSATU's solidarity with the SFTU will be discussed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Zairean military sources told Reuters that Allied Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) rebels had captured the town of Kalemie, 400 km south of Goma, on Monday. Kalemie is a major port on Lake Tanganyika and is the railhead into Kabalo that intersects with the Lubumbashi /Kindu line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian sources told IRIN that the loss of Kalemie to ADFL rebels could block humanitarian aid being sent via the Lubumbashi /Kindu rail link, further complicating an already difficult logistical operation. According to Reuters, ADFL rebels appear to be moving south towards Moba, 150 km from Kalemie, the last major Zairean port on Lake Tanganyika not already in rebel hands. Both towns are in the mineral rich province of Shaba, Kabila's birth place. Military sources told Reuters that the rebels had captured large amounts of military equipment in Kalemie. They also confirmed that Watsa, in Upper Zaire 500 km north of Goma, had fallen and Lubutu, 240 km from Kisangani near the Tingi-Tingi refugee site, was being surrounded by rebels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the increase in fighting leading to the fall of Kalemie, IFRC reported no increase in refugee arrivals to Kigoma, across Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania. Arrivals, mainly of Zairean refugees have been continuing at between 800 and 1,500 per day for most of January, and the total refugee population in and around around Kigoma town, according to IFRC is 40,000. All the Zairean refugees are being moved to a new site at Lagufu, which has a capacity of 50,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a continued effort to restore order to the FAZ, scores of soldiers have been arrested and charged with looting and desertion. A group of 150, including a few civilians, were disarmed on 28 January by SARM in Bumba, Equateur province, and flown to Kinshasa to face trial by a special tribunal, said Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the internal clean-up, the Zairean counter-offensive, led by chief- of-staff General Mahele Lioko Bokungu, is still hampered by a lack of adequate financial and logistical support. Analysts question Mobutu's commitment to regaining the east. A victory over the ADFL rebels following reorganization of the military, they say, would make General Mahele too powerful a force; one capable of supplanting Mobutu's traditional control over the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition forces in Zaire are also hindering the war effort with appeals to Morocco, Togo and Egypt -- all of which have strong ties with France -- not to assist Zaire with troops to fight the rebels, said AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Insecurity in the Watsa area has forced Sudanese refugees, who have been in Dungu 160 km north of Watsa since 1991, to flee back to Sudan. Some 2,000 have already arrived in three camps southwest of Meridi, western Equatoria.  WFP, who has a permanent team based in Meridi, told IRIN that it has provided a 26-day ration for the returnees and NGOs have provided non-food assistance.  An Operation Lifeline Sudan news release today said the returnees began trickling back in early January, but to date there is no clear indication of how many of the former refugees will return. The original 1991 refugee population, which fled insecurity in southern Sudan was estimated between 30- 40,000. Humanitarian sources told IRIN that the refugees reported fleeing from raping and looting FAZ soldiers. It is unclear whether this is a new development resulting from the current fighting around Watsa or if the refugees were fleeing the previous FAZ looting spree following the fall of Bunia. Moving from one conflict zone to another, the returnees have arrived in Sudan amid a renewed Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) offensive in that area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Following EU commissioner Emma Bonino's criticism of the international community's response to the plight of some 400,000 Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire, Rwanda's UN envoy, Gideon Kayinamura, on Monday said that the remaining refugees were composed of 40,000 ex-FAR and their families. &quot;We know that the bona fide refugees have walked back home, the (ex-FAR) soldiers walked into the forest with their arms to join the Zairean army. These are the ones the humanitarian agencies say need assistance,&quot; ambassador Kayinamura told a news conference in New York. &quot;We are saying that it is not appropriate for the humanitarian bodies to extend refugee status to a criminal army that is inside Zaire, and that is holding a few Rwandan refugees as their own hostages, including their own families,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgian Foreign Ministry spokesman Andre Querton told AFP that Belgium would appeal to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday to &quot;reactivate an international presence to provide humanitarian aid &quot; to the refugees. The previous Multinational Force lead by Canada barely got off the ground when it was terminated following the propitious mass return of refugees to Rwanda.  Querton told AFP that Belgium supported Kengo wa Dondo's government, whose proposed July elections offered a &quot;democratic perspective&quot;, unlike its counterparts in Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, on Monday added her voice to the call for an international police or military force to separate extremists from bona-fide refugees in situations such as those in eastern Zaire. She said the force could be used to prevent Hutu extremists from gaining a foothold in the camps and preventing people from returning home.  Humanitarian workers told IRIN that the organizational structure of the camps and statements from refugees indicated that elements of the ex-FAR and Interahamwe were already in control of the camps. Analysts are not confident that an international force would be willing or able to identify and neutralize the extreme Hutu elements in the camp any more than they were able to due so in Goma and Bukavu where conditions were more favourable.  Humanitarian sources also question the political feasibility of disarming refugees who are clearing fighting alongside FAZ forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian sources told IRIN that the crucial issues facing humanitarian operations in eastern Zaire have not been addressed. No international call has yet gone out to the Zairean government, insisting on the relocation of the Amisi refugees to a safe haven away from the front-line, preferably to a location more logistically accessible to humanitarian operations. The source said that the continued detainment of innocent refugees in Amisi was &quot; criminal&quot; and that continued assistance increased the risk that both humanitarian aid and logistical equipment, trucks and plans, could be diverted to the war effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogata begins a tour of the Great Lakes region, including Kenya, on Thursday.  AFP quoted Ogata saying she was &quot;very worried and disappointed&quot; that information emerging daily on the plight of the refugees does &quot;not seem to be have been absorbed very much by the international community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, in his role as mediator, held talks in Arusha Tanzania on Monday with Burundian military leader Pierre Buyoya, the secretary-general of the Organization of Africa Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim, the special US envoy, Howard Wolpe, the UN representative in Bujumbura, Marc Faguy, and a representative of South African President Nelson Mandela to seek ways out of the deadlock, said AFP. He warned, &quot;So far we haven't made any progress. I am beginning to feel that I am providing an umbrella for the killings.&quot; Nyerere said he favoured maintaining economic sanctions against Burundi, which were imposed following the July 1996 coup.  Humanitarian sources told IRIN that exemptions to the sanctions for humanitarian operations were becoming increasingly more &quot;bureaucratic&quot;. For supplies delivered by road from Kenya, agencies are now required to negotiate individual exemptions with the Kenyan National Sanctions committee as well as that of Tanzania. The sanctions were intended to force the Tutsi regime to &quot; restore constitutional order&quot; and open negotiations with the Hutu rebels.  Their effectiveness, given a reportedly flourishing and lucrative black market trade, is a matter of debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government-organized four-day forum on restoring peace to Burundi ended 31 January with many of the 60, mainly Tutsi, delegates divided on how to stop the civil war. Jan van Eck, an expert on conflict resolution said that &quot; There was a substantive shift in favour of negotiations,&quot; where &quot;several months ago you couldn't even speak about negotiations.&quot; Hutu parties boycotted the debate and Hutu rebels were banned from participating in the national forum unless they declared a cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the recent national forum, former president Nyerere was not so optimistic saying he and &quot;many in Burundi, did not consider the conditions were right for holding a national debate in Burundi,&quot; largely because of the high degree of insecurity in the country, said AFP. &quot;Conditions are worse than they were last July,&quot; he said. &quot;The killings are going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi will proceed with the trial of 80 people accused of participating in massacres following the 1993 abortive coup by elements of the Tutsi military against the first Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye. The assassination sparked mass killings around Burundi. At present, only 13 of the suspects are being held for trial while others remain free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 2,250 Burundian male students headed for military training camps following last month's decree that military service would be compulsory for first year university students, most of whom are of Tutsi ethnicity. Female conscripts are expected to leave for military camps next week. This marks a change for the Burundian army which until recently has been composed only of professional soldiers, said AFP. University dean Gilbert Midende announced the introduction of compulsory &quot;civil and technical&quot; service for some 3,000 first and second year students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Kenyan 'Daily Nation' reported that the Ugandan military had rescued more than 200 civilians allegedly taken captive by the Ugandan Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in a series of battles in the Rwenzori mountains over the last few weeks. Security officials claimed that more than 1,000 people have been taken hostage since mid-November 1996. Zairean support for the ADF rebels has been a source of contention and justification for a Ugandan military incursion into Zairean territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state-owned Sunday Vision paper, quoting the Ugandan minister of state for defence, Amama Mbabazi, said that Uganda would not attack the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels' base in Sudan. &quot;This government respects international borders and therefore we are not planning any such action,&quot; however, &quot;if they choose to invade us, we'll be able to show them it was not the best option.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The HRFOR has recently released a report criticizing aspects of the genocide trials in Rwanda, stating that in trials held between 8 and 20 January there was a lack of fair-trial guarantees as required by Rwandan law and Article 14 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, to which Rwanda is a party. The report follows HRFOR monitoring of court proceedings for 13 persons being tried in Byumba, Butare, Gisenyi and Kigali Ville prefectures, proceedings which resulted in seven persons being tried, convicted and sentenced to death and six persons having their trials adjourned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HRFOR report cites cases in which defendants were not allowed lawyers to defend them, were unable to respond to allegations against them and were not able to cross-examine evidence. In once case, a defendant charged with genocide was asked if he had a lawyer. When a lawyer offered to defend the accused this was disallowed by the presiding judge as the lawyer did not have authorization from the Ministry of Justice to represent that particular defendant. When the defendant requested an adjournment so he could find a lawyer this was not granted. In the final event, the defendant was sentenced to death without having been given the opportunity to defend himself and without witnesses having been called, either for the prosecution or the defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HRFOR report urges the Rwandan authorities to ensure that 'essential rights', including the right of civil claimants to legal counsel, are safeguarded during the trials. The HRFOR also expressed the hope that the Government of Rwanda will soon act on a proposal submitted by the Rwandan and Foreign Lawyer's' Initiative, supported by HRFOR, to train Rwandan and foreign legal counsel to represent defendants in each prefecture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* HRFOR also reported that during December four people were extrajudicially executed by the Rwandese Patriotic Army in two separate incidents. On 10 December, three murder suspects were killed by RPA soldiers during a public meeting in Mbuye sector, Satinsyi commune, in Gisenyi prefecture. The three were accused of killing a local businessman on 4 December. On 21 December, a recent returnee from Zaire who was suspected of murder was executed in a public meeting by RPA soldiers near Ndago, Mubuga commune, in Gikongoro prefecture. He had been accused of killing a genocide survivor and three other persons on 11 December. HRFOR reports that when it raised these incidents with the Ministry of Defence they stated that the events were regrettable and that orders had been given not to carry out such executions.  HRFOR has requested the authorities to investigate the incidents and carry out appropriate disciplinary measures against those found guilty of violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* WFP issued a statement dated 29 January, that northern Uganda and other parts of the country could soon face food shortages if the current conflict is not resolved. A WFP needs assessment mission to the northern district confirmed that some 200,000 persons had been displaced by renewed fighting between government and rebel factions. Although many of the displaced risk returning to insecure areas in order to salvage food from their farms, the small reserves remaining will likely be consumed by the end of February, rendering the displaced totally dependent on food aid. Unless there is an early resolution to the conflict before the next planting season, the July harvest will be lost and &quot;full-scale famine will ensue&quot;, WFP claims. This will further complicate the region's food supply situation, already diminished due to drought conditions in Kenya and parts of Tanzania.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA, Zaire (PANA) - Zaire is carrying out a vast conscription exercise aimed at mobilizing manpower for the creation of new brigades to beef up its armed forces now battling rebels in the eastern part of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement made available to PANA in Kinshasa on Tuesday, the country's Deputy Prime Minister, Gen. Likulia Bolongo Lingbangi, said the operation involves setting up &quot;rapid intervention units&quot; to beat off the rebel attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lingbangi said the conscription, which will go hand in hand with the provision of modern equipment to the Zairian Armed forces (FAZ), is being carried out among youths between the ages of 15 and 18 years who had at least four years of post-primary education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement said the general mobilisation seeks to strengthen the armed forces &quot;so that they become a deterrent force and an effective defensive shield&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News about the brigades had been circulating for the past two weeks in Kinshasa, since it was announced that rebels led by Laurent Kabila had overrun Zairian troops and seized several towns in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest reports indicated that the port of Kalemie on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, has fallen to the rebels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - Coca-Cola has pledged an investment of 220 million U.S. dollars in South Africa over the next five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one of the largest foreign investments in post-apartheid South Africa, and comes amid a period of significant new interest in the country by United States companies, including a possible return of the giant automaker, General Motors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the new investment, Coca-Cola's chief executive, Doug Ivester, said it was aimed at doubling the group's business in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently the bottler's turnover in South Africa stands at some than one billion dollars a year in retail sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is presently Coke's 10th largest partner among a total of 210 countries in which it does business worldwide, a ranking which places it between the United Kingdom at ninth and China at the 11th position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coca-Cola officials, who announced the new marketing drive Monday in Johannesburg, said the investment would be split with the seven locally-owned companies which bottle the group's products in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With spare capacity available in the local bottling industry, much of the spending would be aimed at expanding and improving the availability of products to emerging markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe in the future of South Africa,&quot; Ivester said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe the country offers tremendous growth opportunities to those who show long-term discipline, and we believe the time to invest in South Africa is right now,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group already employs 13,000 people in South Africa, and the new investment is expected to create many more jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coca-Cola Southern African President Charles Frenette said the final size of the investment would depend on the needs of the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not about bottling plants. It's about expanding the marketing infrastructure. This is about energizing the market to increase demand and consumption,&quot; Frenette said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coca-Cola Group has also significant interest in sub-Sahara Africa. It recently invested some 100 million in Uganda, Tanzania and Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivester is scheduled to visit Zimbabwe later this week to review the group's investment in that country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (PANA) - Youths who once belonged to the numerous Congolese militia groups have since Saturday been involved in a mutiny at the Loudima military camp, 350 km from here, where they were undergoing training for their integration into the national army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military sources in Brazzaville said on Tuesday that the youths insist they should be enlisted into the national army with the rank of sergeant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youths were recruited in efforts to end the political turmoil that led to the death of 2,000 people in the Congolese capital in 1993, triggered by allegations of rigging in parliamentary polls held that year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To press their demands, the mutineers took control of Loudima railway station, where they erected barricades to prevent traffic between Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire, the country's economic capital. As a result, no train has moved between the two cities since Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Railway sources said the mutineers threatened to set fire to any train that approached the Loudima station. A military and governmental delegation was expected to fly to Loudima on Tuesday to tackle the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 1996, some 300 newly recruited militiamen staged a similar mutiny in Brazzaville, to press demands for integration into the army and the payment of back salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They seized the M'Pila armoured regiment, East of Brazzaville and forced the high command to give in to their demands. Five people were killed in the fighting which ensued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebellious militia go by such names as the 'Cobras' of the Congolese labor Party (PCT-Former single party led by Gen. Denis Sassou Nguesso), the 'Ninja' of the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI-Party of Bernard Kolelas, Opposition leader) and the 'Zulu' of the Panafrican Union for Social Democracy (Upads-Party of president Pascal Lissouba).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These militia groups were officially dissolved in 1995 under a &quot;peace pact&quot; which was signed by the political leaders, leading to the integration of some 2,000 militiamen from various political parties into the regular army.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United Nations (PANA) - The United Nations has proposed measures aimed at establishing a credible political framework for elections in Liberia next May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his latest report on the war-ravaged West African country, the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, said the proposals were based on the conclusions of a technical survey conducted by a UN team that visited the country last December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The recommendations were also developed on the basis of the need for the elections to be as inclusive, operationally simple and cost-effective as possible,&quot; Annan said in the report, released in New York on Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the recommendations would be tabled for confirmation as an &quot; provisional electoral package&quot; for the elections, scheduled for may, at a special meeting of the ECOWAS committee of nine and the Liberian parties later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The package is also expected to be incorporated into the Abuja agreement, the peace accord signed by warring parties as a formula for ending the six- year-old civil war in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The package would not seek to replace or reform the existing Liberian electoral system, nor to change the country's constitution, but would serve as a provisional mechanism (for) ...the installation of a government of national unity and pave the way for a return to a constitutional order,&quot; the UN chief said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Annan has expressed concern at the disagreement among Liberians on some of the recommendations, including the number of chambers in the legislative assembly and whether there should be a run-off in the presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disagreement has also been voiced on the composition of the electoral commission, voting by refugees and the roles to be played by the West African Economic Community (ECOWAS) and the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The inflexible tone of some of the reactions, especially on the part of certain of the faction leaders, could be cause for concern,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is hoped that these questions will be resolved through a fully constructive approach by all parties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October last year, the UN received a formal request from the Liberian Council of State for assistance in developing a suitable electoral framework for the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN, which maintains 78 military observers in Liberia, and the Ecowas Peace monitoring group (Ecomog), whose 7,500 troops are helping to keep the peace in the country, are jointly monitoring the implementation of the Abuja agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest action by Ecomog has been the disarming of combatants from the numerous warring Liberian factions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa's new constitution, hailed as one of the most progressive in the world, came into effect at midnight Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It replaces the interim constitution under which the country has been governed since the inception of the first democratically elected parliament in May 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its final certification in December 1996 by the Constitutional Court ended negotiations which began after President Nelson Mandela's release February 1990 from 27 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All South African parliamentary parties were involved in the drawing up of the new constitution, with the exception of the Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom Party, which walked out halfway when its demands for international mediation went unmet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new constitution reaffirms South Africa as a constitutional republican state. Significant features include a Bill of Rights which enshrines the rights of all people in South Africa and affirms the democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill of Rights will be enforceable not only by individual citizens and organizations against the state but also between individuals and civic organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new constitution provides for six state institutions supporting constitutional democracy: the Public Protector; the Human Rights Commission; the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities; the Commission for Gender Equality; the Auditor-General; and the Electoral Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new constitution also stipulates that it has to be reviewed annually by parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first major event under the new constitution will be the inauguration Thursday of the National Council of Provinces. This body replaces the Senate and is geared to giving the nine provinces a more direct say at national parliamentary level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cape Town on Friday, Mandela will open the first parliamentary session under the new constitution at a joint sitting of the National Assembly and the council.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) agencies have this week delivered emergency food and relief supplies to a group of more than 2,000 Sudanese refugees who returned from Zaire in January due to rising conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The returnees have settled in three camps -- Gbuo, Nabanga and Bamani -- southwest of Maridi, Western Equatoria. They were robbed of all their possessions en route to Sudan and some women were reported to have been raped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were among some 30,000-40,000 Sudanese who fled to Zaire in 1990-91 to escape escalating fighting in southern Sudan between forces of the Sudan Government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). The Sudanese lived among the Zairois in various parts of north-eastern Zaire, near Isiro. They said they were returning to Sudan due to increasing instability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We decided that we would come back home, even if home was not liberated fully,&quot; returnees Umoya Ginana and Arale Semuma told an OLS assessment team. &quot; We are glad to be back home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assessment team found that the returnees looked reasonably well- nourished, but were weak and hungry from their journey. They had returned with very little food, mainly cassava and sweet potatoes, most of which had run out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coordinated OLS emergency response included a full food ration to last for 26 days, medicines and vaccines, and 675 survival kits containing items such as blankets, jerrycans, cooking pots, mosquito nets, plastic sheeting, fishing equipment, soap and salt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The food was purchased by the World Food Programme (WFP) from World Vision International (WVI) which had obtained stocks of grain from local farmers through a barter programme. It was transported by WVI truck from Nzara on the Sudan-Zaire border, along with the survival kits provided by WVI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical supplies and vaccines for a measles immunization campaign were provided by Aktion Afrika Hilfe (AAH), Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF)-Belgium, and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). MSF-Belgium, with support from UNICEF, will dig shallow wells to provide immediate supplies until boreholes can be drilled in each camp. OXFAM is providing on-ground coordination for the emergency response, as well as assistance with the transport of food and supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In neighbouring Mundri County, another 22 tonnes of WFP food and 325 WVI survival kits will be delivered for some 8,000 people who were displaced during 1996 by fighting between the SPLA and the Sudanese Army. The people are reported to be in serious condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF-Belgium will conduct a nutritional survey to determine malnutrition levels, and a further 50 tonnes of WFP food will be delivered in the coming days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teams of UN and NGO staff will remain in the area to monitor the situation of the displaced and returnee populations. Sudanese are continuing to return from northeastern Zaire, where an estimated 20,000 Sudanese are believed to be living in the Dungu area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly appointed OLS Coordinator, Mr Carl Tinstman, praised the NGOs and UN staff for their rapid response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;The returnees and displaced people were clearly in a desperate and vulnerable state. The OLS agencies responded in a well-coordinated and mutually supportive manner within 48 hours of the need being identified. This kind of emergency response is what OLS was created for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emergency response is coordinated by the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association (SRRA) in cooperation with UNICEF, WFP and five NGOs operating under OLS -- AAH, Mundri Relief and Development Association (MRDA), MSF-Belgium, OXFAM-UK/I and WVI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OLS is a consortium of more than 40 UN and non-government agencies providing emergency relief and rehabilitation for war-affected civilians in Sudan. As lead agency for OLS, UNICEF coordinates humanitarian activities, while WFP manages aircraft operations on behalf of the consortium.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) strongly protests the arrest, on the orders of General Bolozei Ngbudu, of Jean Mbenga Muagianvita, an independent freelance journalist for the private newspapers &quot;La Tempete des Tropiques&quot;, &quot;Umoja&quot; and &quot;L'Example&quot;. Muagianvita was arrested by soldiers of the Military Action and Intelligence Service (SARM) on January 23, 1997, in connection with a series of articles published in November 1996 about President Mobutu's United States-based political lobbyists. Muagianvita is currently held incommunicado at SARM headquarters at Kitambo in Kinshasa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day of his arrest, SARM soldiers returned with Muagianvita to his home to search for documents. Seven SARM soldiers raped Muangianvita's 14- year-old daughter in the presence of her father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan group of journalists committed to the defense of its colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ contends that this action against Muangianvita is a blatant violation of his right to hold and express opinions and ideas. CPJ also repudiates the brutal and violent rape of his adolescent daughter by SARM soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We respectfully remind your Excellency that Zaire ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 19 of which guarantees the right to &quot;seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kind.&quot; These rights are also guaranteed by Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights to which, we again respectfully remind Your Excellency, Zaire is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPJ requests that Your Excellency do everything in your power to ensure the immediate and unconditional release of Muangianvita and the arrests and convictions of the soldiers who raped his daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) strongly protests the arrests, during the first week of January 1997, of Mrs. Biongo, the wife of exiled Zairean journalist Benjamin Sham Shamg Lapong, and her three young children.  To date, the Zairian Security Service has refused to disclose their whereabouts. The arrest is believed to be in connection with articles written by Mr. Lapong that were published in the independent newspaper &quot;La Tempete de Tropics&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan group of journalists committed to the defense of its colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ is deeply disturbed by the unlawful arrests of Mrs. Biongo and her three children. We regard these arrests as intended to intimidate and silence Mr. Lapong and we condemn the use of innocent persons and the unlawful means to this end.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Col. Victor Ozodinobi has been removed as military administrator of Nigeria's northern state of Borno, the Presidency announced Wednesday in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement issued by David Attah, chief press secretary to military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, said Ozodinobi had been replaced by Lt. Col. A.  Aniebo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No reason was given for the removal, or the fate of the former administrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ozodinobi was among a set of military administrators sworn in August 1996.  He becomes the first state chief executive to be sacked by the three-year-old Abacha regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, with some 100 million people is a federation of 36 states, six of which were created in October 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, Col. Mohammed Marwa, the administrator of Lagos State has been insured under a 10-million-naira (about 120,000 U.S. dollar) life policy announced Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the state's insurance company, Olalekan Smith, who presented the administrator with the policy document in his office Tuesday said it became necessary because of the threat on Marwa's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administrator survived a bomb attack, which injured at least two people in his convoy last December. Another bomb exploded near his office at Ikeja two days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one has claimed responsibility for the two blasts and another bomb that injured a score of soldiers in January, also in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his reaction, Marwa said the unprecedented insurance policy was not personal to himself, but the occupant of the office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since assuming office in August, Marwa has initiated a number of programmes that have endeared him to the people of Lagos, Nigeria's economic hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notable among these are measures to protect lives and property in the city of six million people, from heavily armed bandits.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudanese government troops and civilian volunteers are currently battling to fight off an offensive by an alliance of exiled Sudanese nationals, who have seized several locations in the Blue Nile province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Libyan News Agency reported Wednesday that Gen. Salah conveyed a message from Sudanese president Omar Hassan Al-Bashir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JANA said the message dealt with the situation in Sudan, Khartoum's worsening relations with its neighbors and bilateral issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan has in recent times repeatedly accused Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda of supporting rebels fighting government forces in the country's southern and eastern parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khartoum also accuses Egypt of being involved in an &quot;American-Zionist&quot; conspiracy aimed a overthrowing Gen. al-Bashir's regime by encouraging the secession of southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt and the other neighboring states have denied the allegations, saying the situation in Sudan was basically an internal affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Salah's visit to Libya is part of his country's diplomatic move to secure the support of Arab states in its strained relations with the four neighboring states.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vector-borne disease, transmitted by tsetse fly, is endemic in a wide belt in Africa covering 34 countries across the continent, an international workshop was told here on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop on &quot;integrated rural development through sustainable management of tsetse and trypanosomiasis/mosquito and malaria,&quot; has brought together at least 100 participants from Africa, Europe and North America.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been jointly organized by the Nairobi-based International Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology and the Ethiopian Science and Technology Commission, with the support of the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is intended to provide public forum for the exchange of current options for &quot;sustainable vector and disease management by both researchers and practitioners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a joint paper entitled &quot;Wars and vector-Borne Diseases in Africa,&quot; an Ethiopian and an Italian scientist said trypanosomiasis is known to be prevalent in a wide belt covering 37 countries across the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sleeping sickness is re-emerging as a major public health concern. At least 250,000 persons in Africa carry the parasite, and in 1994 there were epidemics in Cote d'Ivoire and Togo,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper was prepared by Yonas Tegegn and Alessandro Loretti, programme officer and senior technical adviser for Africa, respectively, of the World Health Organization-assisted Pan-African Emergency Training Center in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said most of the 53 African countries, with an estimated total population of 760 million in 1996, are highly susceptible to water-borne diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the continent has the highest level of the incidence of malaria, with Sub-Sahara Africa accounting for more than 90 percent of all malaria cases in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scientists said malaria kills about two million people in Africa each year, about half of them children under five years of age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two also told the workshop that every year, some 200,000 cases of yellow fever occurred in 33 African countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. They added that Nigeria was the most INL002 from SSS.065 (970205-16:55) QN PANAINL .PANADKR MSG064G/02E PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PAN(2) affected, with an estimated one million cases in the past decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1990, yellow fever epidemics have occurred in Kenya, Ghana, Gabon, Liberia and most recently in Benin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, visceral leishmaniasis, a water-borne disease caused by minute protozoans that invade the tissues, is endemic in the horn of Africa, especially Ethiopia and Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is spread by changes in the environment, movement of the population and is also associated with HIV infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cases of the disease have been reported from Kenya and as far south as Malawi,&quot; Yonas and Loretti said in their joint document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other victor-borne diseases in Africa, cited by the two scientists, include onchocercosis, dengue, rift valley fever, plague, fever, trachoma and filariasis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Joint teams of South African and Mozambican policemen seized 40 stolen vehicles in Maputo Tuesday, in a joint nation-wide operation that has just reached the Mozambican capital, Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sweeps, which reached Maputo on Tuesday, followed similar police activities in the central cities of Beira, Chimoio and Tete, where irregularities and abuse of power were so evident that local businessmen threatened to close down their companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean and Zambian policemen were also involved in the operations in Chimoio and Tete.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambican policemen in Maputo stopped vehicles Tuesday on OAU Avenue, one of Maputo's main arteries, and plain clothes South African policeman carried out inspections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A traffic policeman, who declined to give his name, told the Mozambican news agency, AIM, that Mozambican Police were in charge of the operation, which is coordinated from the Maputo City Police Command. The role of the South Africans, he said, was limited to checking whether or not the vehicles were on their list of stolen cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The procedures followed by the police teams are not uniform. Some give cleared vehicles a sticker, so that they will not be stopped again. Others do not, even when drivers ask for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The privately-owned Maputo newssheet, Mediafax, reported that the operation also began Tuesday in Xai-Xai, capital of the southern province of Gaza.  Zambian and Zimbabwean police were also in evidence there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provincial police commander, Raimundo Cossa, told Mediafax that he would not allow any police irregularities, and that the Mozambicans would remain in control of the Gaza operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that a South African policeman had tried to enter the residence of the provincial governor, Eugenio Numaio, but a Mozambican traffic policeman had stopped him. One of the complaints from the central provinces was that the police violated premises without any warrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No-one should enter any citizen's home without a search warrant issued by a judge,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of Tuesday, 20 cars had been seized in Xai-Xai and were in the custody of the provincial police command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Cossa said that some Mozambican car owners were the victims of South African insurance fraud. That is, the South African owners sold the cars, then reported them stolen in order to claim insurance money.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (PANA) - The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared March 24 as the date when it will observe the first International Anti-Tuberculosis Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing this in Brazzaville last week, the WHO Regional director for Africa, Dr Ebrahim Malick Samba, said the day would be used to sensitize the public about the disease and donors on the need to contribute towards its eradication.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samba, who was addressing a news conference in the Congolese capital, said some 7.2 million new TB cases have been registered in Africa over the past five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figure, he said, represented 90 percent of the world's total, estimated at eight million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is tragical, Samba added, is the fact that nearly a third or 2.6 million of TB infected people die each year, 2.4 million of them in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attributed the upsurge of TB to AIDS, rising poverty and the lack of access by populations to medicines, whose prices have kept on soaring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a remedy, the WHO regional office announced that it will uplift its capacity to combat the disease by creating specialized teams of health personnel in 46 African states.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I strongly condemn this attack,&quot; said Jose Ayala-Lasso, the agency's high commissioner, in a statement in New York.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Tuesday that the military should take necessary punitive measures against the killers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayala-Lasso has ordered the remaining human rights officers working in Cyangugu, Gisenyi and Kibuye provinces to relocate to Kigali. Those in Gitarama, Gikongoro and Butare are to remain at their base stations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was Tuesday speaking during a visit to his Nigerian counterpart, Tom Ikimi, ahead of the African foreign ministers' conference to be hosted by Libya later in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montaser said intra-African conflicts needed to be resolved quickly because of &quot;foreign elements&quot; behind them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - Some 40,000 Rwandan refugees fled encampments in the Shabunda area in eastern Zaire today following reports rebels have taken a nearby town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the refugee sites in Shabunda are empty,&quot;said Dillah Doumaye, UNHCR's deputy representative in Zaire. &quot;The refugees packed their belongings, the plastic sheets they use for shelter and went away. They were prepared to leave and the departure was orderly.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small UNHCR plane bringing in blankets and food was surrounded by a group of about 150 people demanding to be flown out. Police twice fired shots in the air to disperse the crowd. The plane took off with all three UNHCR staff members posted in Shabunda on board after distributing the relief supplies, originally destined for the Catholic mission of Shabunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local authorities said the refugees moved out after reports swept Shabunda that Katshunga, a small town located 45 km northeast of Shabunda, had fallen.  There has been no independent confirmation of these reports. A UNHCR staff member went by motorcycle to Katshunga on Sunday carrying some relief supplies for a local missionary helping refugees in transit. He met a group of 150 refugees on the road to Shabunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR plane failed to find a trace of the refugees who had departed and had to return to Kisangani because it was running out of fuel. The plane will overfly the area on Thursday and attempt to locate the refugees, Doumaye said.  They were believed to be heading west, possibly toward Kalima and Kindu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees abandoned Shabunda a day after UNHCR completed the distribution of a four-day food ration of beans, corn meal and corn-soya blend. A food warehouse and a hospital in Shabunda were looted, allegedly by the local people, as the refugees were leaving. About 7,000 Zairians were also reported to have fled Shabunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR has been the only agency operating in Shabunda since other international relief workers withdrew in December in the midst of insecurity and extreme difficulties in bringing in assistance. Relief supplies had to be flown in via a small grass airstrip, put on bicycles, then boats to cross a river and finally onto the backs of refugees for the final journey to the encampments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR is also assisting another 40,000 refugees in nearby Amisi and 120,000 in Tingi-Tingi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emptying of Shabunda came on the eve of High Commissioner Sadako Ogata's departure on Thursday for the Great Lakes region. She is attempting to find ways of increasing the amount of humanitarian aid into eastern Zaire and ways of assuring the safety and protection of refugees in other areas.  She plans to visit refugee sites during her visit to Zaire, the first stop on her 10-day trip to the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - In a further deterioration of the security situation in Rwanda, four employees of the UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) human rights observers were shot dead in the southwest Cyangugu prefecture yesterday. A fifth died in hospital later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The observers - three Rwandans, a Briton and a Cambodian - were travelling in two clearly marked UN vehicles in Karengera commune when ambushed by a large group of unidentified armed men. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has expressed shock and dismay over the attack, whose perpetrators are not known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the first time human rights observers have been killed in Rwanda.  In an immediate response to the incident, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Jose Ayala Lasso, ordered members of UN observer missions in the western Cyangugu, Gisenyi and Kibuye prefectures to withdraw to Kigali, while observers in the Gitarama, Gikongoro and Butare prefectures were told to remain at base.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, the UN announced that staff members were being temporarily withdrawn to Kigali from the four prefectures of Cyangugu, Ruhengeri, Gisenyi and Kibuye, and strict security measures were being implemented elsewhere in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayala Lasso also called on the Rwandan authorities to investigate the murders and punish those responsible. The High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, strongly condemned &quot;the wanton killing&quot; of the human rights workers. UN agencies are meeting in Kigali today to decide what further steps to take. The Rwandan government provided a plane to fly the bodies back to Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kibuye, Gisenyi, Ruhengeri and Cyangugu prefectures, which border Zaire, have become increasingly unstable since the mass return of Hutu refugees from Zaire and Tanzania at the end of last year. Large numbers of ex- FAR/Interahamwe are believed to have infiltrated, concealing themselves among the returnees and possibly joining up with other ex-FAR/Interahamwe members hiding out in dense forests along the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four prefectures are well-known hotbeds of Hutu insurgency, with the road running alongside Lake Kivu from Gisenyi to Kibuye said to be particularly dangerous. Following the killing of three Spanish aid workers in the northern Ruhengeri prefecture last month, the Rwandan army beefed up numbers in the area in a sweep against insurgents. Rwandan Interior Minister Alexis Kanyarengwe told Reuters on Monday he feared increased violence in the country after the murder on Sunday of a Canadian Catholic priest in Ruhengeri.  His killers have not been identified, although Kanyarengwe pointed the finger at Hutu extremists. The priest, Fr Guy Pinard, was witness to the massacres of 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rwandan judicial authorities yesterday handed down the 10th death sentence since it began holding genocide trials last December. The accused, sentenced by a court in Gikongoro, was a member of the extremist Hutu MDR- Power party and said to have committed numerous murders. He did not have a lawyer and refused to enter any plea. The same court sentenced a second defendant to life imprisonment, the first such penalty in the trials, as previous suspects have all received the death sentence. Meanwhile, Radio Rwanda reported yesterday that some genocide suspects in Butare were committing suicide rather than go to trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rwanda unveiled its new policy on resettlement to the international NGO community last week. The plan is based on group settlements consisting of 100- 200 families. Presenting the policy, Rehabilitation and Social Integration Minister, Patrick Mazimpaka, announced that committees headed by the local bourgmestre would be set up at commune level to oversee implementation and plan site selection. NGOs would be allowed to complete housing rehabilitation work already underway, but future work must conform to the new policy, according to which each family will receive a house with land for farming within two kilometres of the residence. The minister said if national reconciliation were to be achieved, then everyone must be willing to live and work together. With a current population of some eight million, the government saw no other way to alleviate land pressure, he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rwandan vice-presidential adviser, Emmanuel Ndahiro, has warned Zaire against bringing in military reinforcements from Chad, Morocco and Togo, saying the war in the east would not come to an end. Kinshasa meanwhile has asked Egypt for &quot;political assistance&quot; to help it overcome the rebellion.  According to AFP, the head of the Africa desk in the Egyptian foreign ministry, Marwan Badr, denied there had been a request for military aid. &quot; Egypt wants to maintain balanced policies with countries in the Great Lakes region which respect their territorial integrity,&quot; he was quoted as saying. &quot; There has been no military cooperation with Zaire since the 1980s,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington has urged other nations to stay out of the fighting in eastern Zaire, saying it had &quot;ample evidence&quot; that foreign troops had entered Zaire.  State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns, who would not divulge which countries Washington believed were sending troops into Zaire, said the USA would continue to &quot;discourage actively any outside country or any outside group of foreigners or mercenary groups...from participating, entering into the conflagration in eastern Zaire&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile a member of President Mobutu's entourage yesterday in Rabat, Morocco, to discuss military aid, again rejected any notion of negotiations with the rebels. Lubmana Kapasa, who heads the presidential press service, referring to rebel leader Laurent Kabila, said &quot;You don't hold a dialogue with a traitor.&quot; &quot;War remains the only solution to ending the rebellion and the position of the Zairean government has not changed one iota on this subject.&quot; He also lashed out at the international community which &quot;up to now has not reacted appropriately&quot; to the region's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean Foreign Minister Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda returned to his country last night following an 11-day visit to the USA and Europe, intended to brief foreign governments on the current situation. In comments broadcast by Zairean radio after his arrival, he said Zaire must continue with efforts to make its &quot;just cause&quot; understood. &quot;Unfortunately, we must admit that there is a lack of information, which has to be addressed,&quot; he said. He added that Zaire was awaiting Sadako Ogata's visit from 6-8 February during which the humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire would be addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Zairean authorities admitted Kalemie port had fallen to the rebels, ADFL leader Laurent Kabila today claimed his forces were making progress on all fronts. Speaking in Goma, he said rebel troops were continuing their advance in the mineral-rich province of Shaba and were about 40 km from the Lake Tanganyika town of Moba. According to Reuters, Zaire's defence ministry acknowledged the port area of Kalemie had been taken, but fighting was underway elsewhere in the town. &quot;They have now taken the port but our soldiers are still fighting in other parts of the town,&quot; a senior ministry official said yesterday. Reliable sources concurred with claims by Kabila that on the western front, his forces were 30km from Shabunda and advancing rapidly, while also making significant progress in the direction of Lubutu.  Kabila also claimed that Isiro in the northeast would be captured in a &quot; matter of hours&quot;. The rebels have given the Kinshasa authorities until February 21 to start negotiations or face a &quot;widespread offensive&quot;, AFP reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UNICEF said hundreds of new arrivals were reported daily in Punia, 140km southwest of Lubutu where there were currently some 2,200 refugees. Some 9, 000 refugees were en route from Kibereketa (90km east of Punia) to Kasese and onward to Punia. According to the Zairean authorities, another 11,000 refugees had passed through Punia on the way to Yumbi where 3,000 of them were now blocked at the River Lowa as no fuel was available for the ferry crossing. UNICEF said it believed the figures to be correct. UNICEF and Caritas Dioceses have set up a supplementary feeding centre in Punia which is supplied by air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Burundi today denied sending troops into neighbouring Zaire to back the rebels. &quot;Burundi has never sent troops into any neighbouring countries,&quot; Foreign Minister Luc Rukingama told a press conference in Brussels. &quot;In fact we need them to deal with our own internal situation.&quot; Zaire has alleged that Burundi, along with Uganda and Rwanda, are sending troops to fight alongside the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi's Justice Minister Gervais Rubashamuheto has given details of the cases being prepared against 80 people suspected of plotting to overthrow the government in October 1993, when the-then Hutu president Melchior Ndadaye was killed. Speaking on Radio Burundi, the minister said arrest warrants would be issued next week and the suspects would appear in court in March. Last November, Burundi called for the establishment of an international tribunal to punish genocide crimes regarding the massacres that ensued after Ndadaye's death. The move was also recommended by the UN special rapporteur on human rights, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro. A UN commission of enquiry into Ndadaye's assassination concluded last July that the murder was planned in advance and executed by &quot;officers highly placed in the line of command of the Burundian army&quot;. The massacres constituted &quot;acts of genocide against the Tutsi minority&quot; , the UN report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Germany yesterday handed over 120,000 US dollars towards logistical support for the mission of the newly-appointed UN/OAU special envoy for the Great Lakes. Germany's UN mission said in a statement that $67,000 was earmarked for an aircraft to be used by the envoy, Mohamed Sahnoun, who is due to leave New York later this week. The rest will be used for telecommunications and equipment required by the mission which will be based in Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is to discuss the Great Lakes crisis with former US president Jimmy Carter on Sunday. The meeting falls within a week-long visit to the USA by Museveni during which he will meet UN and US officials in New York and Washington, the Carter Centre announced. The Centre has been helping facilitate dialogue between leaders of the Great Lakes countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the troubled north of Uganda, anti-government rebels ambushed and killed a police chief, the state-owned New Vision reported yesterday. It said the district police commander of Kitgum, Asafu Retesia, was the second district police chief to be murdered in two years. The rebels belonging to the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) later set his car on fire. Police said they could not establish the cause of death, the paper added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - Kenya's central bank says the overall rate of inflation in the country rose from 10.8 percent in December 1996 to 10.9 percent in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Average annual and the three-month annualized inflation increased marginally to 9.2 percent and 9.4 percent from 9.1 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively, during the same period, the bank says in its monthly economic review.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in inflation is attributed to non-policy factors, especially the decrease in the supply of basic foods following the prevailing dry weather in January and the increased in crude oil prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the underlying month-on-month rate of inflation declined to 9.7 percent in January from 11.1 percent in December 1996. &quot;The underlying three- month annualized rate of inflation fell to 8.6 percent from 11.9 percent during the same period,&quot; the bank says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It adds that the month-on-month inflation rate is expected to decline to 7.  0 percent by April. But, this requires that the expansion in money supply be constrained to an annual rate of not more than 16 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To enhance the effectiveness of monetary restraint, the bank says, concerted effort is required to ensure that the government's budget deficit is reduced from the current level of 2 percent of GDP to a surplus by end of fiscal year 1996/97 as projected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government overdraft decreased by 15.64 billion shillings (1 U.S. dollar = 55 sh.) to 29.99 billion shillings mainly due to improved revenue collection by the Kenya Revenue Authority and tighter controls on government spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currency in circulation increased by 2.3 billion shillings to 3.6 billion shillings, due to increased inflows of foreign exchange.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Ethiopia's food security reserve has increased by at least nine fold, in four years, to 283,000 tons now, it was announced Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This reserve is enough to feed four million people for six months by providing them 600 grams of food each in emergencies, the country's Emergency Food Security Reserve Administration said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency plans to raise the reserve by stockpiling 307,000 tons as stipulated by its three-year mid-term objective. Ethiopia, which over the last two decades depended on foreign food aid due to recurrent drought and civil war that ended five years ago, has made self-sufficiency in food one of its main objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the country has been able to raise its food security reserve during the last two years by drawing from the surplus production in the agricultural sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency has, over this period, loaned 110,000 tons of food to non- governmental donor organizations in Ethiopia for various development projects in rural parts of the country under the &quot;food for work scheme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NGOs are presently purchasing grain from local markets to reimburse the agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia is expecting a bumper crop of about 12 million tons of food grain from the 1996-97 harvest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, (PANA) - World Bank President James Wolfensohn is scheduled to begin a nine-day trip to Africa on Saturday to demonstrate the bank's support for the continent's social and economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa is the World Bank's top priority and we want to strengthen our partnerships with the region,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference in Washington DC, he said Wednesday that he would visit Ghana, Mozambique, Senegal and South Africa to review Bank funded projects and meet government and community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will go and see for myself what is happening and discuss how to sustain and build on the gains resulting from improved policies,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank's special representative to the United Nations, Alfredo Sfeir- Younis, said in New York that part of the reasons Wolfensohn chose to visit the four countries was that they were &quot;doing very well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sfeir-Younis told reporters: &quot;We want to confirm and re-affirm our commitment to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank says Africa's economic performance has improved considerably, with about 24 countries posting growth of at least 4 percent -- above the rate of population growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank says success has had a positive impact on growth and exports, improved income for millions of smallholder farmers and given grounds for optimism about the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfensohn said he had &quot;very important policies&quot; to be discussed with ranking officials., some of which had to do with deepening the macro-economic adjustment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since my last trip I have been getting good news out of Africa,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfensohn will be accompanied on the trip by his wife, Elaine, and the bank's vice presidents for Africa, Callisto Madavo and Jean-Louis Sarbib.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (PANA) - Libya supports the creation of an African intervention force but it must comprise entirely of African troops, that country's foreign minister has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea put forward by the U.S.A. is good.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our main concern is that the force should be controlled by the Organization of African Unity not otherwise, &quot; Omar Al-Montaser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting this Thursday, the Tanzanian news agency, Shihata, said Montaser was speaking to reporters on arrival on his day- long visit to Dar Es Salaam.  The agency did not say he arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his first visit to Africa in 1996, former United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher proposed creating the force to intervene in African crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, at the time, the proposal received mixed reactions from African states. Some leaders feared a strong Western influence, or control, on such a force since the U.S. and its allies had pledged to fund the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African President Nelson Mandela said the formation of the force should be initiated by O.A.U. member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montaser said African countries had every reason to take resolute steps to stop crises on the continent, such as the one in the Great Lakes region. He said Africans from immediately outside that conflict region were also concerned with its stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montaser is in Tanzanian to brief his counterpart, Jakaya Kikwete, on Libya's preparations to host the O.A.U.'s ministerial meeting later in February. Montaser was in Nigeria Tuesday for the same reason.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (PANA) - The Burundi Democratic Front (FRODEBU), the former ruling party in that strife-torn country, on Thursday requested for United Nations troops to restrain the military government in Bujumbura from further harassment of the masses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FRODEBU chairman, Sawanya Jean Minani, told a news conference in Dar es Salaam Thursday that the military government of Maj. Pierre Buyoya was intimidating the innocent majority Hutu people in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The front, under the leadership of the late President Melchior Ndadaye, swept the polls in Burundi's multiparty elections of June 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya, who sprang back to power in a July 25, 1996 coup d'etat, belongs to the minority Tutsi ethnic group which is dominant in national army, now reported to be marauding around the country looking for the Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after taking over power, Buyoya banned all political parties, including FRODEBU. Some of these have been fighting against the military government which is also faced with sub-regional economic sanctions aimed at forcing a return to democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanzanian News Agency quoted Minani as telling journalists in Tanzania's business capital that the military regime has been abducting and sending the Hutus to rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these ares, he claimed, the government deprives them of of food and water and later sends television crews to film them. The objective of this, he said, was to show that it was the masses who were suffering from the effects of sanctions, imposed by neighboring states in east and central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minani said the political problem in Burundi could be solved if UN forces intervened &quot;to save the poor souls in Burundi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed further that the military regime in Bujumbura has expelled all Hutu students from the University of Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minani said the only remaining undergraduates are Tutsi, who besides participating in regular courses, were undergoing military training &quot;for the coming war against the insurgent Hutus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exiled Burundian politician appealed to countries in the Great Lakes region to strictly abide by the sanctions imposed against Buyoya's regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burundi military government has been trying to hold dialogue with some of the internally-based opposition members. However, it has rejected calls to negotiate with rebels who have taken arms to fight the central government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include the National Committee for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD) of former Ndadaye's interior minister, Leonard Nyangoma.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - A Hungarian coach, Kalman Meszoly, one of the three Europeans eyeing the post of technical adviser for Nigeria's national team, the Super Eagles, says he is hopeful of snatching job from a host of other European peers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a very pleasant interview and certainly I am hoping that the NFA (Nigerian Football Association) will choose me...,&quot; Meszoly said after facing the soccer body's interview panel on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Hungarian has to wait until after Feb. 11 the next interview date set for two other contenders short listed for the job, Frenchmen Phillipe Troussier and Claude le Roy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Ekeji, one of the NFA panelists said Thursday both Frenchmen had asked for postponements because of club assignments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, another NFA source told PANA in Lagos there were indications Troussier might have withdrawn his candidacy after his club, F.U.S. Rabat declined his application for leave to travel to Nigeria for the interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this is confirmed, the contest could be left to Meszoly and le Roy, who are no strangers to African soccer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battle for the post of Eagles' foreign technical adviser, ignited since the abrupt departure of a Dutch coach, Johannes Bonfrere in Sept. 1996, came to a head last week when the Eagles' chief local coach, Shuaibu Amodu, was sacked for breach of contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Amodu's replacement with Monday Sinclair, Nigerian sports minister Jim Nwobodo insisted the country needed a foreign technical adviser to take the country to the World Cup in France next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere, claiming mistreatment by some sports officials, ditched Nigeria for the oil-rich emirate of Qatar after taking the West African country's under-23 squad to win the Olympic gold in August 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His predecessor and compatriot, Clemens Westerhof, also left Nigeria in a similar fashion after taking Nigeria to its first World Cup in the United States in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soccer buffs in Lagos say the problem with Nigerian football, has always been administration and not a lack of talented players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, which supplied four of the African all-stars that beat their European peers 2-1 in an anti-racism solidarity match in Lisbon last week, has a score of players pursing professional career across the globe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa (ENA) - Ethiopia's food security reserve has grown by nine-fold in the past four years, the Emergency Food Security Reserve Administration (EFSRA) announced here yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emergency food reserve has this year reached 283,000 metric tonnes against 30,000 in 1985 E,C., according to administration manager Samuel Tumoro.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration, he said, could in case of emergency feed four million people for six months by providing each 600 grams of food daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He ascribed the increase in food reserve to assistance donors extended to promote the objective of the administration and annual budget allocation by the government for the purchase of 5,000 metric tonnes of food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Non-governmental donor organisations are presently purchasing grain from local markets to reimburse the 110,000 metric tonnes of food they took on loan basis from the EFSRA to expedite development projects in progress in various localities, Ato Samuel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration which used to depend on foreign food aid has over the past tow years raised its food security reserve drawing from the surplus product in the agricultural sector, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Purchasing grain from farmers to boost food security reserve drawing from the surplus product in the agricultural sector, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Purchasing grain from farmers to boost food security reserve will have a positive effect in warding off price fall due to surplus production besides encouraging productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration, he said, is conducting a study to construct additional warehouses in Gondar, Bedele and Sodo towns and their environs with a view to implement its medium-term objective, stock-piling of 307,000 metric tonnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The construction of 26 stores in Dire Dawa, Kombolcha and Makalle at a cost of over 61 million birr has been completed, the manager said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country expects to harvest over 117 quintals of crop this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A WFP spokesperson said that their UN compound in Lubutu, Zaire has been surrounded by Zairean soldiers (FAZ). Six Zairean staff members remain in the compound and are being denied permission to leave and one staff member was reportedly beaten by soldiers. The spokesperson said that WFP understands that the situation in Lubutu was delicate &quot;but hoped the situation would be resolved quickly and be sympathic to the fact these people are aid workers.&quot; The FAZ has reportedly confiscated radio equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the mass exodus of refugees and humanitarian staff from Shabunda, a joint UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, and Federation mission visited the governor of Maniema to discuss the situation and receive authorization to do overflights to locate the fleeing Shabunda refugees. Flying over the area en route to Kindu, small population movements were sighted near Matili located en route to Kalima. The governor authorized more surveillance flights for today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No NGOs were able to get to Amisi yesterday and some were turned back en route to Tingi-Tingi by Zairean army soldiers (FAZ), who claimed that the FAZ was engaging ADFL rebels near Lubutu. A decision was taken to reduce the presence of humanitarian workers at Tingi-Tingi. A further withdrawal of remaining expatriate and national workers is in progress today. In the event that the refugees become trapped in rebel held territory, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes Region, Martin Griffiths, has initiated discussions with concerned agencies and authorities on contingency planning for a movement of refugees from the areas of Tingi-Tingi and Amisi through rebel-controlled areas to Rwanda, should the opportunity arise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources on the ground reported that at least some of the local population of Shabunda welcomed the ADFL rebels as a &quot;liberating&quot; force. However, other sources reported civilians fleeing. The rebels reportedly left a small military presence in Shabunda before moving on. According to sources in Punia this morning, the town had not yet fallen to ADFL rebels. In Lubutu, military sources indicated that two military helicopters had delivered 76 wounded FAZ soldiers to the local hospital yesterday. Sources on the ground report an increase in the incidence of vehicles being &quot;borrowed&quot; by the FAZ to evacuate their families. Unconfirmed reports indicate that the elements of the refugee population are being armed by the FAZ to fight the rebels. Moreover, with the retreat of FAZ forces, humanitarian sources also noted a resurgence of the anti-UNHCR sentiment among former DSP/Contingent soldiers, who had been previously employed by the UN to provide security for the refugee camps in the Kivu regions. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, arrives in Kinshasa today, and discussions on outstanding issues regarding the Contingent were already planned with the Zairean authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire began reinforcing troops and equipment on two fronts, near Kisangani and Kalemie, on Wednesday to block ADFL advances, a senior defence ministry official told Reuters. The mercenaries fighting with the FAZ remain deployed further north at the Watsa airport, although the town itself had fallen to ADFL rebels late last week. A director of the Sizarail company told Reuters at its headquarters in Kinshasa that trains were getting no further than Nyunzu, 150 km west of Kalemie and east of the Kabolo T-junction on the Lubumbashi-Kindu line. Sources from the area believe that the ADFL may find reinforcement or encouragement among a local Banyarwanda ethnic group, the Batabwa, settled south of Kalemie, who have historic links to the Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to local sources, both Lubumbashi and Kinshasa remain calm despite the significant rebel advances. Reuters reported that the recruitment campaign to enlist 26,000 teenage soldiers got off to a slow start in Kinshasa. Mobutu, who spent Tuesday and Wednesday in Morocco, is reported to be on his way back to Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio 'Voix du Zaire' in Kinshasa announced that Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda, the deputy prime minister in charge of foreign affairs, this morning received the Angolan ambassador to Gabon, Bernardo Dombele M'Bala, who bore a message of friendship from his foreign minister to his Zairean counterpart. The Angolan government reportedly expressed solidarity with the Zairean people who are facing foreign interference in Zaire's internal affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* ADFL leader Laurent Kabila continued to call for a negotiated solution to the conflict. According to the Kinshasa opposition daily 'Le Potentiel', Kabila has proposed former and fellow Lumumbist Antoine Gizengo as interim- president, opposition leader Etienne Tshisikedi as interim prime minister and himself as vice-prime minister and minister of defence. Both Gizengo and Tshiskedi, whose political roots date to the 1960 independence, are members of the opposition forces in Kinshasa and have advocated for a negotiated solution. Zaire has repeatedly dismissed Kabila's offer to negotiate, saying Zaire does not negotiate with &quot;puppets&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Radio 'Voice of Israel' in Jerusalem reported that Israel is freezing its defence ties with Zaire in view of the difficult domestic situation in that country. This clarification was made after a senior official at the Kinshasa Defence Ministry said that China and Israel would assist Zaire in setting up and training new commando units to fight rebels in eastern Zaire. Isreal initially trained Mobutu's elite presidential guard (DSP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* US Secretary of State Madeline Albright urged neighbouring countries, Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, to stay out of the escalating conflict. A senior US official said: &quot;President Museveni's position yesterday was that, well, there were just some border clashes because actually there were insurgents on the Zairean part of the border attacking Uganda and therefore Uganda had to respond -- it's kind of a hot pursuit issue,&quot; said Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Humanitarian sources reported three attacks on agency compounds situated in Kigali, Rwanda on Tuesday night. Two guards were beaten in one attack, but no other injuries were reported. ICRC Nairobi confirmed that it is freezing its operations in Rwanda, for ten days as of yesterday. Some non-essential staff will be put on stand-by on Nairobi while others will remain in Rwanda.  ICRC, until this decision, had around 120 expatriate staff in Rwanda, its largest programme in Africa. It will continue to evaluate the security situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - OmniTech Plc, the company founded in 1994 to engage in information technology system design and programme development is holding an exhibition today, Friday, 7 February between 12:00 and 6:00pm in the Chamber of Commerce Hall, to demonstrate eight software packages produced by the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hoped that the exhibition will encourage clients to invest in domestically produced software, with the benefits of convenient servicing and maintenance when experiencing problems. Said a spokesman for the company: it is an opportunity to prove that &quot;our country is rich in having qualified experts in the field.&quot; The aims of the exhibition are to raise public awareness and to help reverse the current &quot;trend of improper utilisation of computers&quot; in Ethiopia. He went on to say:&quot; we are the only company that produce software as a company,&quot; which makes this exhibition something of a novelty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition, to be opened by the Deputy Commissioner of the Ethiopian Science and Technology Commission, His Excellency Ato Asrat Bulbula, includes advanced packages developed for both specialised and general use. Packages such as the Legal Cases Information System tailor-made for the Federal High Court this year and Omni Truckers made for Alpha Truckers Association are displayed alongside Omni Ethiopia, an MS Windows programme with Ethiopic keyboard and fonts interface, so demonstrating the broad range of OmniTech's production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This creative exhibition is in keeping with the company's innovative founder and General Manager Ato Daniel Admasse, the Ethiopian to design the first Amharic word-processor. In a recent press release, the Manager remarked that the occasion is &quot;important both in creating awareness among the public and in paving the path for the expansion of the technology in the country.&quot; If all goes well, today's exhibition could see the start of some extremely exciting and fast-developing technological advances for 1997.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - We read with sadness and concern that Omo Reserve, Mago National Park, is losing its rare and beautiful wild animals to poachers.  According to the park manager, the poachers are well-equipped with automatic rifles but the park's security men have neither the manpower nor the ammunition to stop these illegal hunters from destroying our national, natural treasures and environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poachers, said to be from the areas adjacent to the park, are trading their 'loot' with neighbouring countries in return for arms. A meeting recently took place between park officials and local residents. It was agreed that no-one was to enter the park armed, but how is this to be enforced when there are only fifteen game-keepers responsible for patrolling the 200,000 square kilometers of national park?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The game-keepers are simply unable to cope with their burden which has been made tragically clear in the figures: zebras have now been totally wiped-out from the park; elephants which were on the increase are now also fast disappearing; buffaloes are coming close to joining their fellow zebras in their plight. Add to this the failure to replace guards as they retire and we see that they, like the wildlife they are there to protect, are in imminent danger of dying out. Mago Park will soon be left to the free destruction of its murderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of funds cannot even be held responsible for the degeneration in the park's upkeep, for an entrance charge has been in operation for the last three years. In the final quarter of 1996, this alone, generated 51,000 Birr.  The ultimate irony is that the number of tourists visiting the reserve has increased three-fold in the last year but if present trends continue, then soon there will be no wild animals for visitors to see at Omo Reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the South Omo Woreda board has urged for more short-term training for game-keepers and wants to see them better equipped and with updated weapons. To respond with a defensive front of aggression would be to reduce ourselves to the level of the attackers with the possibility of killing even more animals in the event of a 'cops and robbers' shoot-out.  This rather transgresses from the idea of the park as place of calm, a sanctuary for nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the arguments must rage, then keep them outside the park; within its borders, energy must be devoted to preservation, not annihilation. Solutions must be tough but conciliatory. Let's see the Park working with the local community, not in antagonistically to it, promoting mutual understanding and co-operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps it is time that the 'recent meeting' between Park and residents became a regular occurrence with a locally-elected spokesperson for the community in continual collaboration with park officials. There is a desperate necessity for more game-keepers and who better than local inhabitants, who will have a superior knowledge of and relationship to their home environment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must address this issue immediately, looking to the root of the problem - the need for aggressors to poach at all. We should be looking at broader problems- if there was less regional conflict, would there be such a demand for weapons and the killing of so much wildlife?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, this problem can only be solved in the immediate future, at local level, but the difficulties facing Mago Park differ little from those in our other national parks. The solutions, whatever they may be, must be implemented on a national scale. We must launch a national campaign, if necessary calling on the international community to keep Ethiopia the Eden that it is, for wildlife.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The future of wildlife in the Mago National Park in northern Omo is looking bleak. According to a report in the Addis Zemen, Amharic government daily, their number is decreasing rapidly, and the zebra in the park have completely died out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The park's head, Ato Bereket Nareab, said those people in the surrounding areas were coming in with modern automatic weapons, killing the animals and selling them to neighbouring countries. Apparently, the park's fifteen game keepers are no match to hunters who get weapons from neighbouring countries in exchange for their kill. Earlier, when the number of elephants was noticeably increasing, hunters came and killed off 11, Ato Bereket said.  However, he also mentioned that at a recent meeting with the local people, it was agreed that no one may enter the park's ground armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a shame that regions are not giving as much attention to wildlife conservation, as they are to talking about the 'unequalled natural beauty of Ethiopia'. There is no doubt that with proper care, the country's national parks could be a major earner of much needed hard currency. The Mago National Park began charging visitors some three years. In the first quarter of the present Ethiopian year, Mago earned 51 thousand birr from the tourists.  Ethiopia may have untapped natural resources, but if responsible bodies are not assigned to take care of them, then we are likely to lose the only thing we can honestly boast about.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Some nostalgic devotees of the crown have feared that the funeral of ex-Crown Prince Assfaw Wossen, which was conducted on February 2, 1997 at the Trinity Cathedral here in Addis Ababa, might indeed turn out to be a non-event as officialdom would have liked it to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was probably one reason why so many veterans of the legendary former Imperial Guard had not put on their imposing uniforms. The few who did had a field day, capturing the limelight as the gathered mourners fixed their gaze on them with apparent admiration and nostalgia. As if to rise equal to the occasion, the gallant men in uniform tried, with their imperious postures and gestures, to recreate the aura of royal glory of yore which they once so assiduously helped to produce.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was apparent that most people including myself, who came to the funeral, did not know the exact time at which the rites were to be performed. This was probably why at least one wedding ceremony was conducted at the church a little before 10 a.m. In any case, the merry-making of the wedding mocked the somber mood of those who gathered for the last rites of the man who might have been Emperor of Ethiopia but for the ironies of life. A man driving one of the cars in the wedding motorcade added insult to injury when he defiantly honked his way out in celebration! It might have been his way of paying tribute to life in the face of death, or perhaps he didn't know a damn thing about why all those people had gathered!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of mourners had already assembled in the compound of the Trinity Cathedral by 10 a.m. Thousands more flocked to the church later, so much so that the entire church compound was almost filled to overflowing by around 1 p.m. Repeated pleas were made through the public address system for the congregated mourners to make way for the funeral procession which was by then said to be approaching the vicinity of the Trinity Cathedral. Scores of cars carrying mourners moved into the church compound, making the space problem even more acute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon the Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, His Holiness Abune Paulos, arrived in a four-wheel-drive automobile led by a police car and followed by at least two vehicles in which bishops could be seen. One bishop arrived alone in a car from which he alighted and wove his way through the crowd towards the main entrance to the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From then on the level of activity in the church compound picked up dramatically. Cameras flashed and clicked. Video-cameras scanned the ranks of the crowds. Luxury automobiles carrying what looked like members of the royal family and Rastas wearing headdresses decorated with the national tricolor came in quick succession. This was a clear sign that the funeral procession was close by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first contingent of the procession entered the church compound, carrying photos of the late Crown Prince and, somewhat strangely to the uninitiated, ululating and clapping, but also wailing and weeping and chest- beating. Three to four such contingents passed by before the hearse which carried the coffin of the late Crown Prince, entered the church grounds. The hearse was thickly thronged by weeping mourners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no cannon-toting carriage or coach, no dead march or martial music, no official cortege, motorcade or cavalcade, as would surely have been the case had ex-Crown Prince Merid-Azmatch Assfaw Wossen Haile-Selassie died a monarch. I was not able to witness the funeral rites conducted inside the church, where the remains of the Crown Prince were interred into the royal crypt built at the time the Trinity Cathedral was constructed, not least because there was no way I could have moved up-front through the thick crowds of mourners; besides, thinking that the burial was to take place at 10 a.m. I had by then stood for more than three hours, and my back and legs had begun aching rather badly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, according to eye-witness accounts, the funeral rites were officiated by His Holiness Abune Paulos who led the celebration of mass and later on gave benediction. A brief life-history of the late Crown Prince was read and some 60 flower wreaths were placed on his crypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did I go to the ex-Crown Prince's funeral? It so happened that I was passing by the Trinity Cathedral around 9:30 a.m. I had heard earlier that the Crown Prince was to be buried on February 2, 1997, but I didn't know exactly at what time. I saw people going to the church in large numbers. So, I joined in. I felt obliged to do so out of the enormous debt of gratitude I still feel I owe his late father, the great Emperor Haile-Selassie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a kid I went to a school named after the great king. Our school was one of the educational establishments which he personally visited occasionally.  He never came empty-handed. I remember vividly receiving a bunch of red grapes and three birr from his Imperial Majesty's hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, of course, there were the innumerable annual Christmas gifts, cakes, soft drinks and a sweater I, along with thousands of my fellow pupils, received from him. The climax was when I experienced his electrifying charisma, receiving prizes from him at the Grand Palace for standing top of my unit in fifth grade. Those grapes had a lot to do with that academic achievement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In college, we students at the time were pampered, in a way the average Ethiopian could not even dream of, with a stipend of 50 birr each or its equivalent in food (which is excellent by today's standards) and lodgings. It was, however, in the university's dining room, where we used to drink milk almost like water, that college students plotted to dethrone the Emperor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I did not understand student politics very much, but all the same I was greatly impressed by the brilliance and eloquence of the student activities of the time. &quot;Mr. Chairman, order! Point of information! objection! I move a motion to the effect The emperor's days are numbered, his regime has been shaken to its very foundations Have I not walked the streets of Paris and London. Land to the Tiller! Woe to the revisionists!&quot; Such were the political slogans of the times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Emperor took the brunt of the difficulties caused by the student unrest, but Crown Prince Assfaw Wossen always stood by his father - always except perhaps once, and that probable exception was in December 1960 when he was forced to renounce his allegiance to his father on the radio by the coup makers of the day led by Brigadier Mengistu Newaye. As it turned out, the coup collapsed and the Emperor was fully restored to his throne, Assfaw Wossen was apparently fully pardoned as it was thought he could not have done it except under duress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the next fourteen years the Crown Prince lived, as he did in the previous thirty years, in the overwhelming shadow of his illustrious father, until the Derg staged a successful cope against the Emperor in 1974. As the &quot; creeping coup&quot; of the Derg casts its ominous shadow on the Emperor himself, Crown Prince Merid-Azmatch Assfaw Wossen left the country under very inauspicious circumstances, reportedly on a stretcher after having suffered a paralyzing stroke from which he never fully recovered until his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the Derg period, the ex-Crown Prince lived in exile in England and the United States, and shortly after the assumption of power by the EPRDF, he was crowned in exile as King Amha-Selassie by the monarchist political party Moa Anbessa ( which by the way, is legally registered by the current government) of which he was the leader and figurehead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the February 2, 1997 funeral of the late Crown Prince Merid- Azmatch Assfaw Wossen demonstrated that a large section of the Ethiopian society still harbours a fascination for the monarchy, which many would have otherwise thought was dead and buried. His last rites commanded popular respects beyond anybody's fondest expectations, perhaps more by association with the indubitable greatness of his father than as a result of his own achievements which could hardly be considered as monumental.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only in retrospect and by comparison do many Ethiopians seem to realize the immense unifying power of the throne. I personally have no doubt in my mind that the formal burial of Assfaw Wossen's father is going to be a momentous occasion that would bring tears to the eyes of not just thousands but millions of Ethiopians across the nation, for Emperor Haile-Selassie was, admittedly in retrospect but with all the justification and evidence in the world, a singularly talented man who fortified and modernized the foundations of our common home, Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The lingo used in the discussion of Ethiopia's external debt is exasperatingly evasive. Just ask a top-notch economist or even an equally qualified external debt accountant in the relevant government department exactly how much Ethiopia's external debt in US dollars is as of a certain date, say, Feb. 1, 1997 and how much debt reduction she got since the EPRDF came to power, and the likely reply you would get would be something like this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it is in SDR's and you've got to disregard ruble-denominated debt.  Then, of course, the debt has got to be broken down into multilateral and bilateral. The bilateral has got to be chopped up into Paris Club and London club. Reckoning in NPV terms is a must. As for the debt reduction, one has to distinguish between debt relief, which apparently includes debt restructuring, and debt reduction proper. London terms and Naples terms are also things we have to look at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, of course, there are the pre-cut-off date, the post-cut-off date, the moratorium interest and the various debt ratios. So, it is a bit complicated, but I hope I have given you some clues on how you may approach your questions, which, I must admit, are relevant and timely&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are a real gentleman you may just, but only just, resist an outburst at such evasive double-dutch. But could you help chatting back thus:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For God's sake, all I want to know is whether Ethiopia's outstanding external debt, including ruble-denominated debt, is 4 billion or 5 billion US dollars and the total debt reduction Ethiopia got since May 1991 is 300 million or 400 million US dollars. That is all. I. want. to. know! How in the world do you expect me to know the Birr/SDR or dollar/SDR exchange rate? Just because the SDR is an IMF brainchild does not mean that it must still be around when it is actually almost extinct! The dollar (and you know whose dollar I mean) is still king, and all attempts to dethrone the yellow metal have come to nought!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My complaint briefly is, if you don't give me those key figures, it is extremely difficult for me to get interested in all those bits of jargon you are trying to vaunt. If I know exactly how much Ethiopia's external debt is, how much she is getting by way of debt reduction every year, or as frequently as debt reductions are made, and how much the annual debt-service is, all in absolute terms, then perhaps I wouldn't mind trying to acquaint myself with your London, Naples or even Timbiktu or Paramaribo terms!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, don't blame the poor reporter of the government-owned English daily, the &quot;Ethiopian Herald&quot;, for recently sending in a news story on the matter as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paris Club provides 67 percent debt relief for Ethiopia - The Paris Club of creditor nations have agreed on a 67 per cent debt relief for Ethiopia. In a statement the Paris Club issued in Paris yesterday the debt relief given to Ethiopia was the most generous terms of debt reduction currently provided to the World's poorest nations&quot; - &quot;The Ethiopian Herald&quot;, January 25, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">67 percent of what? If we knew the &quot;what&quot;, it would have been easy enough finding out how much on a 15 - birr pocket calculator! How about the following quote:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All truth is simple. It looks complicated only when it is not known or when it is being deliberately hidden.&quot; You may try to figure out which it is in this particular case!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By comparison, apparently more knowledgeable sources report the recent news of debt relief for Ethiopia as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Paris Club Agrees a Debt Restructuring for Ethiopia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Paris Club met on January 24, 1997 with representatives of Ethiopia.  The representatives of the Creditor Countries agreed to recommend to their governments a reorganization of the maturities falling due during the period covered by Ethiopia's arrangement with the International Monetary Fund. This represents an important restructuring of Ethiopia's external debt: it applies to payments due under loans from, and credits guaranteed by, Ethiopia's official creditors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The representatives of the Creditor Countries noted that Ethiopia's low per capita income and heavy debt burden call for strong adjustment efforts together with exceptional treatment of debt. The representatives of the Creditor Countries welcomed the implementation by the Government of Ethiopia of an economic and financial programme supported by the first annual arrangement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility with the International Monetary Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In response to the delegation of Ethiopia's request, Creditor Countries agreed to recommend a treatment providing notably for debt reduction up to 67% . The agreement implements the &quot;Naples Terms&quot; agreed in December 1994 for the treatment of the poorest and most indebted countries. Recognizing the great value of contributions already made by the Creditor Countries in order to alleviate the burden of servicing ODA debt, the maturities on ODA loans will be consolidated on a very long term basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a voluntary manner, each Creditor Country may also undertake limited debt for nature, debt for aid, debt for equity swaps or other local currency swaps, for up to 20% of the debts concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Lastly, Creditor Countries also agreed under certain conditions to hold a meeting to consider, by the end of 1999, the matter of Ethiopia's stock of eligible debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Understandably, the language of the above press release is diplomatic and somewhat legalistic. The concerns expressed about Ethiopia's low per capita income and heavy debt burden, and the recommendation for the special treatment based on them, plus the nice words uttered about the government's implementation of an economic and financial programme warm the cockles.  Otherwise, the essence of the press release may be summarized as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the representatives of Creditor Countries will recommend to their respective governments that debt maturities falling due during the period of the IMF-sponsored economic programme for Ethiopia be reorganized;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* representatives of Creditor Countries recognize that Ethiopia needs strong adjustment efforts together with exceptional treatment of debt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* representatives of Creditor Countries agree to recommend to their respective government debt reduction of up to 67 percent of the basis of &quot; Naples Terms;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a voluntary debt swap arrangements of up to 20% may be undertaken;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A very brief pr&lt;130&gt;cis of the above, using only key words and phrases, would be:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a recommendation to reorganize debt maturities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* strong adjustment efforts and exceptional debt treatment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a recommendation of debt reduction of up to 67 percent on &quot;Naples Terms;&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* voluntary debt swap arrangements of up to 20 percent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, our semantic algorithm tells us that the recently held talks between the representatives of the Paris Club and the Ethiopian government yielded no more than two recommendations, one observation and one agreement to act voluntarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where did the reporter of &quot;the Ethiopian Herald&quot; get his &quot;Paris Club provides 67 per cent debt Relief for Ethiopia?&quot; Provides? It sounds as if we are going to get it in a few days or, in fact have already got it! But actually there is going to be a long wait before anything concrete transpires on the basis of these recommendations. The recommendations have first to reach officials of Paris Club governments with executive power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are typically extremely busy souls who are unlikely to be attracted by topic sentences in their executive summaries which have terms such as &quot; debt relief&quot; in them. They may shove off files containing such descriptors by saying, &quot;oh, the beggar thing again!&quot; After a long while and perhaps after being poignantly reminded of their mortality upon hearing that some people they know are battling against cancer, they may decide they may as well do something for their souls while they still can; and may have a second look at the &quot;beggar thing&quot;!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So it is Ethiopia again, in the east of Africa. The Americans like to call it the Horn. Poor Ethiopians, they never could get rid of their superiority complex! It is that Prester John myth and of course there is the Battle of Adwa and the associated Menelik syndrome. If only they knew how backward they are! They still can't tell the difference between Microsoft and the Internet.  O.K., what is it they want this time? 67 percent debt reduction on 'Naples Terms'? Debt reorganization? Debt swaps? If 'Naples' is 67 percent how much is 'London'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Important interruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister is on the phone: &quot;You know jolly well how worried I am about this bloody thing called mad cow disease. I have had barely enough time to navigate through this labyrinth called EMU, but look at what the rest of Europe is saying about cow insanity, if ever there was such a thing!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, yet another long spell may elapse before the &quot;debt relief&quot; file receives another look from the political executives of Europe. Besides, the sums have got to be done. Suppose the executives decide to approve the recommendations, what does debt reorganization mean in terms of reductions in annual debt-service payments? What does a 67 percent debt reduction imply in dollar or sterling terms? In other words, exactly how much is Ethiopia going to get in terms of debt reduction on &quot;Naples Terms&quot;? Precisely the same question would be asked about the debt swap arrangement by each Paris Club country which volunteers to carry out one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, the recent Ethiopia - Paris Club agreement is really nothing more than a mere recommendation upon which an executive (often parliamentary) decision is required before implementation begins, which itself is conditional on Ethiopia's economic reform performance and is to be carried out in phases! Why not take up the issue again in the year 2000!?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pessimistic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O.K. let us make it just a short time before the arrival of the EURO!  Finally, would someone please tell us exactly how much Ethiopia's outstanding external debt is in dollar (not SDR!) terms and how much Ethiopia got again in dollar terms, by way of debt reduction since the EPRDF annihilated the Derg?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - For South African fans enjoying a feast of cricket, the arrival of the Australians is the cherry on top</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT hardly seems credible that, in the midst of what seems a plethora of cricket, we have yet more coming our way - the Australians open their account with the gentle stroll in the park against the Nicky Oppenheimer XI at Randjesfontein next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the light of the fact that next Wednesday is the date scheduled for the final of the current one-day international series - and the Oppenheimer match collides with the spare day held over for the final in case of rain - it means that tours are becoming very much of the seamless wall-to-wall variety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has placed an immense amount of pressure on the players. Not least of these pressures has been the continuous need to perform at peak level. Even in a professional age, where the outside interferences of having to earn a living in a totally different arena have been eased by the players' percentage of gate and TV money, this call for continued excellence is an impossibility.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All teams have their slumps, all players their drops in form. In this respect, it is well to examine the fortunes of Sachin Tendulkar and his Indian tourists, and our own side under the steering of Hansie Cronje, before examining the Australians and their current up-and-down form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tendulkar, like Mohammed Azharuddin before him, has suffered on a personal level, struggling to find the form with the bat that has marked him as one of the globe's premier players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Indians have been hampered by a lack of depth in their bowling which has permeated into virtually every other sphere of their play, and the current tour of South Africa is doubtless one they will be more than happy to relegate to the misty realms of yesterday. For even though the emergence of Rahul Dravid and Saurav Ganguly as players capable of walking the hot coals of a pitch seared by the pace of Allan Donald offers extra weight to the fact that the wristy players of the sub-continent can play outside India, there remains the problem of indoctrination on home-grown wickets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The days when an Indian new ball bowler's main job was to turn his arm over for an over or two to take off the shine for the spinners has left us. The Indians cannot continue to over-bowl the likes of Javagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad the way they have. Not when the same malaise of just too many overs bowled has taken the edge off as fine a player as Anil Kumble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this aspect, Tendulkar could do worse than look at how Zimbabwe's skipper Alistair Campbell has used his sometimes meagre resources. Exciting as Zimbabwe have been, they lack the real bowling depth so manifest in the wealth of South African riches. Yet Campbell has used what he has sparingly and intelligently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One always has the feeling that, even when the game has started to run away from him, Campbell knows exactly what he is doing with the attack. He is a fine captain, despite his meagre years, and he has lived with both the superb form of a veteran like Eddo Brandes and the wayward, nine-wides apprenticeship of Everton Matambanadzo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, Cronje, coach Bob Woolmer and the South African selectors have ridden the waves of form and fortune. In this they have done a simply magnificent job. They have stuck with the classic classy talents of Andrew Hudson, without much to show on the scoreboard in the one-dayers simply because he owns that class and ability, before finally resting him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It means that - until a spot in the final was all but secure - the frontrunners of our next generation of international players have sat it out.  It has not been a bad thing in the analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Adams has had the breathing space he probably needs before the rigours of a three-Test series against the Aussies; Adam Bacher has doubtless learnt to bridle an impatience he has to get back out there - an aspect which has shown in the ways he has managed to get himself out; and it has lit a veritable fire in the heart of Jacques Kallis. Kallis has champed at the bit as the South African top order has stuttered, and come back into the side steaming with both bat and ball to add yet another name to the list of growing all-rounders this country can call on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar thing has occurred with the return of Jonty Rhodes, bringing with him the ebullience of old and the priceless ability he owns of being able to change the tempo of a game so dramatically, be it by a sudden run-out or a whirlwind mini-innings, that re-arranges the patterns and thinking of the opposing attack so dramatically. Rhodes will always have his doubters as a five-day player, but in the limited overs game, he remains an almost priceless asset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The willingness of the national selectors to ride the storms has also allowed Cronje to play himself back into devastating form and ease the extra burden that captaincy has placed on him. Again this is cause for congratulation, even if there would be few Indian cheerleaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most of all, the philosophy of staying with the players who have given service and feeding the new blood in at a steady drip has allowed a smoothness in the process of transition that has helped rather than hindered the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which leads inevitably to the state of the Australians. Their particular transition has been a stormy one since the uncompromising - and at times near brutal -ideals of Allan Border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Border has retired, so has David Boon - arguably one of the game's greatest sledgers - the glowering mustachioed menace of Merv Hughes is gone, as has the all-day power and pace of Craig McDermott. Of the newer faces, perhaps the most typical fatality is the elegant left-hander Michael Slater who made such an impact on the last tour, although Ricky Ponting, Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden can also be counted among the casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an oblique way, captain Mark Taylor is also among the walking wounded, off form and under fire from the Australian critics, he faces the same Rubicon Cronje has got a little over halfway across as a man expected to lead and perform all in the same fragile and often complicated human package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shane Warne, whose guiles turned Daryll Cullinan from a would-be lion into a quivering rabbit, has also not been without his problems and, while he remains one of the world's premier bowlers, he has not found it as easy of late to send a side packing in total disarray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, it has not been as easy for the Australians in the past season or so as they have come to believe is almost their right on a diet of cowering post- Botham Poms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet, even with the humiliation of sitting out the final of a one-day home series, the Australians remain this country's greatest rivals, the men we most want to beat. In this regard, it is well to remember that the Australians still managed to retain the Frank Worrell trophy in the ill- tempered series against the West Indians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And perhaps even more importantly, there is nothing they hate worse than to take a beating, a thought process that the more crass historians would have us believe stems directly from an aversion to the floggings on the convict ships. Perhaps. It remains that the Aussies are redoubtable foes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This may not be the team of hard-bitten veterans and burgeoning mirror images that arrived under Border, but there can be little doubt that they are here for a fight. One which begins this Thursday and one that could just see the dips of form level out and make Cronje and his South Africans battle for every run, each wicket and any victory that might be in the offing. It is a prospect worth weighing and savouring.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - One of the most forlorn figures in the Centennial Olympic Stadium in Atlanta last year was that of Adri de Jongh. Instead of enjoying the highlight of her career out on the track the Germiston-based 200 and 400m sprinter watched disconsolately from the stands, her leg in plaster. That was the sad and final outcome to a season which had begun so full of promise but ended in farce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With her personal best of 50.73 in Johannesburg last April she had finally broken into the ranks of world-class quarter-milers and Atlanta shone brightly on the horizon. But as she prepared for Atlanta the pain in her left foot which had been troubling her all season got progressively worse. A local doctor warned her that it could be the start of a stress fracture and she decided to rest for two weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once at the pre-Games holding camp in LaGrange she had to undergo a fitness test and, in what turned into something of a comedy of errors, she was pronounced fit before breaking down in training and being taken off to Atlanta for a scan and then an operation on the day of the opening ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They opened my foot and inserted a pin and I was in a cast for five weeks,&quot; said De Jongh. &quot;I'm going to have it removed after the end of this season. I had a scan last Friday and they said everything was 100%. The only problem is that the screw they put in is lying next to a nerve and that is a bit irritating but it is nothing to do with the stress fracture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just to prove she is over the injury De Jongh not only surprised the crowd with her superb performances at last weekend's Test match against Italy but also herself and her coach Stephane Kotze. In the 400m she blasted out of the blocks and pulled further and further away from the field to dip under 51 seconds for only the second time in her life with a time of 50.91.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that wasn't proof enough, an hour-and-a-half later she was back on the track to scorch her way to the fastest 200m time by a local athlete in South Africa for six years. &quot;I only started training in October following my operation but when I train I train 110%. I'm still only in my pre-season programme at the moment but I knew I was going to do well in the 400m,&quot; said De Jongh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 200m was a bit of a surprise though. I don't know where I got the strength from. I sprinted flat out but all the way I was praying please just get me to the line. When I looked at the time I just couldn't believe it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both De Jongh's 200m time of 22.82 and her 50.91 in the 400m are comfortably under Athletics South Africa's (ASA) world championship qualifying standards - modified after a huge outcry but still tougher than those of the International Amateur Athletic Federation. But with ASA stating that &quot;all altitude performances will be converted to corresponding coastal performances&quot; in terms of their selection criteria, De Jongh may still not have done enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While her 400m time will still pass the litmus test, if De Jongh wishes to double up in world championships in Athens she will have to run even faster in the 200m to meet ASA's 22.94 standard without the benefit of altitude - and therein lies the rub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although as a sprinter her problem is not as acute as that of the middle- distance runner, she still cannot race too often and too fast and be expected to do well later in the year when it counts. &quot;You have to run qualifying times to be selected but that doesn't mean you can't do well at world champs as well. It depends on how you do it. I've already done my times and now I must rest my body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't be disappointed if I now run 51.6 or something because I must save myself for overseas. My programme is very important to me and that is why I can't run every week,&quot; said De Jongh. That hasn't stopped the powers that be from trying to persuade De Jongh - as the sport's current drawcard - to race in Friday night's permit meeting in Potchefstroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all know there's a problem with the South African season but there's no point in being negative about it because then you will never produce results.  I like to be positive because that's my role as a coach. I know we can do well at the world championships but they just mustn't expect us to compete too much in South Africa. They put a hell of a lot of pressure on us to compete in Potch, Marlies (Steyn) as well, but they must realise that if you race too much then you can't train properly,&quot; said Kotze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not that De Jongh will not be around for the rest of the season, depriving spectators and sponsors of one of South Africa's few female stars on the track, but she will now be more selective in order to reach her true potential in Athens in August. &quot;I've got set races where I want to run fast like the All Africa meeting on March 17 (in Johannesburg). There will be some top overseas runners at that meet and if everything goes well I want to run my 400m personal best. Other than that I don't want to run too often and certainly not over 400m. I'm not going to put pressure on myself,&quot; said De Jongh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over and above a more sensible competition schedule in her quest for success in Athens, De Jongh will also be hoping to make it through the year with a clean bill of health. Atlanta wasn't her only brush with injury - she quit athletics after winning the South African under-16 400m title in 1986 after a series of injuries and lost out on a possible trip to the 1995 world championships when she had to have her thyroid removed. And as Kotze says, their main wish is &quot;for an injury-free season&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may be a little easier this year because she is now a full-time athlete after giving up her job as a gym instructor. &quot;You can't work and get to the very top in sport nowadays,&quot; said De Jongh and even though she may not be as financially secure as before she at least gets the sleep and relaxation she needs. Recovery time is just as important as hard training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, coupled with her immense determination could see her reach her goals for the season - to reach the world championships final and improve her personal best. &quot;I'm strong enough to make the final and get a good placing.  I'm not saying I'm going to wina medal but obviously I'm going to do my best.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - New York has legalised 'extreme fighting', an anything-goes mix of martial arts. Ian Katz reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON March 26, Kenny Monday and John Lewis will step into a ring in an as yet undisclosed Manhattan arena and do their level best to beat the living daylights out of one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will pummel, kick, squeeze, pull, bend, twist, slap - anything to render the other man unconscious or subject him to so much pain that he taps the floor in submission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No referee will step in to separate the two men when they begin to grapple and writhe on the canvas that by then will be certainly doused with blood and sweat. No buzzer will sound to mark the end of one round or the beginning of another. And the only protective clothing worn by the combatants will be lightly padded knuckle-guards designed to protect the fighters' fists, rather than the parts of their opponents' anatomy with which they make contact.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this is &quot;extreme fighting&quot;, a self-styled sport which its promoters call the ultimate martial art and its critics call a close approximation to human cockfighting. Pandering to the same primal bloodlust that packed the Colosseum of Rome for gladiatorial combat, the sport has gained in popularity in the United States since 1993 when New York television producer Robert Meyrowitz had the idea of putting two martial arts experts from different disciplines into a ring and throwing away the rule book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far Meyrowitz and other promoters have played a game of cat and mouse with local authorities, staging their &quot;championships&quot; on Indian reservations or in the few municipalities willing to turn a blind eye to what Lonnie Bristow, a past president of the American Medical Association, called &quot;blood- soaked, crude public spectacles&quot;. So horrified have sports officials been by the rise of &quot;total fighting&quot; that two states have banned it entirely, while the athletic commissions of most others refuse to licence it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a move that will have the Marquess of Queensberry spinning in his grave, however, New York recently passed a Bill legalising the modern variation on an age-old theme and clearing the way for the Manhattan event and another tournament scheduled for next month, to be regulated by the state's athletic officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Promoters hope the New York slugfests will help to establish their form of &quot; almost-anything-goes&quot; pugilism as a fully-fledged sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will be as big as boxing or bigger than boxing, it's just a matter of time,&quot; said Donald Zuckerman, whose Battlecade Productions will stage the Manhattan contest. &quot;A century ago boxing was illegal and now it is accepted everywhere. But it is a dying art form. There are 300 or 400 boxing gyms in the United States, but maybe 20 000 martial arts groups.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Promoters of extreme fighting - each one has a slightly different name for it - believe they can exploit the surge of interest in martial arts by drawing fighters from the different Oriental disciplines, as well as from Western-style wrestling and boxing. At next month's tournament at Niagara Falls, a Japanese judo champion will take on a Brazilian jujitsu star.  Aficionados still talk about the devastating kick to the head with which 13- time world kick-boxing champion Maurice Smith felled Conan, the jujitsu expert at the last Battlecade contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Studying for years and kicking punching bags doesn't give you an idea of what you are capable of,&quot; said Lewis, a 28-year-old jujitsu and judo expert who is unbeaten in nine extreme fights. &quot;This is the only way a fighter can actually know how he really stands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His opponent in the March 28 event, 35-year-old former Olympic champion wrestler Monday, offers a similar justification for taking up the sport. &quot; What I'm most interested in is showing the world that wrestling is the greatest form of self-defence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also the small matter of cash, of course. Promoters are coy about the purses for specific fights, but Zuckerman says the total prize money is typically about $200 000 for an eight-bout event, with the least-known fighters earning about $5 000 for a win. Unlike boxing, where the loser frequently stumbles out of the ring after a few seconds several million dollars richer, there are no prizes for second in extreme fighting: &quot;Our belief is that we are putting the prize back into prize-fighting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For promoters the prize is the millions in &quot;pay-per-view&quot; fees forked out for the privilege of watching the fights on cable television. According to Meyrowitz, between 100 000 and 200 000 cable television customers have stumped up about $20 to watch each of his 14 events, while videos of the best fights have sold briskly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Promoters insist the sport's violence is exaggerated by its critics. They point out that eye-gouging, biting and kicks to the throat are all disallowed and that experienced boxing doctors are on hand to stop the fights if a combatant is in danger of suffering a serious injury. While the 2m chain-link fence surrounding extreme fighting rings has been likened to a cage by some critics, promoters say it is designed to prevent fighters hurting themselves by falling out of the ring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And unlike other mainstream contact sports, such as boxing and American football, they say, no one has ever been maimed or killed in an extreme fighting event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it's barbaric, then boxing is more barbaric and auto racing should be totally banned,&quot; said Zuckerman, a former music business executive whose Battlecade Productions is backed by porn king Bob Guccione. &quot;Why is it barbaric for two adult athletes, both well trained in what they do, to try to defeat the other person? Gladiatorial, perhaps. Barbaric, no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in New York are not convinced. The New York Times recently ran a withering editorial asserting that &quot;in a culture awash with violence, there is no need for another form of savagery as entertainment&quot;. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and state governor George Pataki, who bizarrely signed the Bill legalising extreme fighting in spite of his supposed distaste for it, have both pledged to try to have the New York events banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Monday and Lewis are hard at work training for their encounter.  Still panting from his morning workout, Monday explains that he is following his usual wrestling training routine and will begin practising punching next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though he has never been formally taught how to land a punch, he says he learnt to use his fists &quot;on the streets growing up&quot;. He does not regard Lewis as an enemy, he insists. &quot;When the bout is over, we'll shake hands and go about our business.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the South African Football Association (Safa) seeks solutions to its many problems, they could do much worse than phone 643-3341 and ask for Mr Trevor Phillips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief executive officer of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) may not have all the answers to all the questions, but the former pharmaceutical company executive has cured many problems dogging professional football. As the PSL begins the second half of its season this weekend, how pleasant it is to record that 13 of the 18 clubs have completed their 17-match first-round programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the other five, Supersport United, Orlando Pirates, Hellenic and Witbank Aces have just one outstanding fixture, while Vaal Professionals have a two-match backlog.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This situation would hardly merit mention among the professionally run national championships of Europe, but it represents a major step forward for South African football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One need go back only six months to recall the crazy climax to the Coca- Cola Challenge Cup with Pirates having to fulfil seven fixtures after almost every other club had finished its programme. The Buccaneers, inevitably, failed to overtake leaders Kaizer Chiefs, but of far greater significance was the fact that a test of football ability had turned into a test of stamina and strength in depth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phillips has succeeded because he possesses a strong personality, knows what he is doing, and is neutral (members of the A and B teams have faced disciplinary charges within the last week.) He has constantly stressed since his arrival last August that one does not need a degree in brain surgery to run South African football, just some business acumen and a large dose of common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fixture backlogs have been a sore on the face of professional football for longer than this correspondent can remember, yet one physically-formidable Englishman solved the chaos within a few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another example of the no-nonsense attitude emanating from the Parktown offices of the PSL is the reaction to Moroka Swallows's ridiculous request to switch their clash with Orlando Pirates on Sunday from Ellis Park to FNB Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swallows argued that the grass at Transvaal rugby HQ was too long after losing at home to Vaal Professionals last Saturday. Needless to say, if the Birds had won the grass would have been just fine. In the past there would have been endless telephone calls and several meetings and Swallows would probably have had their way. Not any more. Apart from Phillips, PRO Andrew Dipela has developed into a tough administrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the former National Soccer League spokesman who pulled the grass from under Swallows' feet, telling them in no uncertain terms that Ellis Park was their home ground and that is where the match would be played.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PSL is succeeding in other areas, too. Phone calls get answered promptly (if a little abruptly), Phillips does not spend all day at so-called meetings like most other soccer officials, and promises are kept. While the BP Top 8 and Coca-Cola Cup are no more, a new knockout competition reportedly carrying R5-million prize money is coming and the Castle Premiership carries a record R500 000 first prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future of professional football looks bright although one must hasten to urge caution as false dawns have been part of the South African football landscape for too long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Safa should note is how a small group of reasonably-paid professionals can run an operation without many hiccups. Let local equivalents of Phillips be found to steer the mother body on a safe course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While praising the PSL for fixing so many leaks, it would be foolish to paper over cracks that remain. A chain is as strong as its weakest link, and the league has 16 of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth, however unpalatable it may be, is that if you take away Chiefs and Pirates, there is virtually no crowd-pulling power, especially with Amazulu and Sundowns in the doldrums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solving that problem will keep Phillips, Dipela and company busy for some time to come, but they will surely find time to answer the Safa call. We trust the arrogant aloofness of the past has disappeared and assistance will be sought.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Oliver McCall says God will be in his corner when he fights Lennox Lewis for the title. He may need him, says Kevin Mitchell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HAVING been dropped on his head as a baby, Oliver McCall seems to have been in a state of almost permanent, thumb-sucking belligerence ever since. This is an admirable quality if restricted to a boxing ring, say, but a nuisance otherwise, which is why the fighter's CV contains several contests not recognised by The Ring magazine but fully annotated in police stations from Chicago to Nashville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man they call &quot;The Atomic Bull&quot; was made for boxing's china shops. Two years ago, Lennox Lewis's chin tinkled and cracked and McCall snatched away his heavyweight championship - at least that portion of it presided over by the World Boxing Council and influenced by Don King. They meet again this weekend. Allegedly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Away from work, McCall's demeanour is radically different, a fact borne out by his behaviour after the Lewis fight. The champ could not contain his excitement and celebrated with the sort of gusto normally associated with a roomful of elephants on speed - a not altogether misleading comparison, given McCall's preferred recreational chemicals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ollie, who might consider changing his nom de guerre to &quot;Another Fine Mess&quot;, would seem to belong to the George Best school of sporting ethics: he thinks a balanced diet is a beer in one hand and a joint in the other. Having not been able to answer the question: &quot;Where did it all go wrong?&quot;, McCall, like Best, was cast into a vacuum when the clamour faded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three weeks after he lost his title to Frank Bruno in September 1995 on a night of dispiriting under-achievement, he was left to ponder a return to life on the periphery of heavyweight boxing, and went on a spree of eye- popping proportions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former heavyweight champion of the world - notionally a figure regarded with some respect and awe - was said to have been mugged by three men in a less than salubrious part of St Louis in the early hours of the morning. The object of their desire, according to police, was his loser's cheque worth nearly $1,5 million, stuffed down his sock. Police arrested two suspects, recovered the cheque and were bemused when McCall refused to press charges. &quot; What robbery?&quot; McCall asked. &quot;I love St Louis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCall was strangely subdued in the Bruno contest, in stark contrast to his manic appearance against Lewis. Still, after he had failed to provide a complete drugs sample for the British Boxing Board of Control, suspicions were naturally roused as to his chemical legality in the ring. The fighter took exception and threatened to sue. The board have never announced further details of their concern and McCall has never sued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCall met up with the law three times in 1996. It started in April in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where he was committed to a drugs and alcohol rehabilitation centre after being arrested for possession of marijuana. Back on his own patch in Chicago the following month he was picked up again for possession and put on 18 months' probation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All was quiet until Christmas, when he turned up in Nashville and celebrated Yuletide with a spectacular performance in the lobby of the hotel housing several boxers who had arrived for the January 11 show which saw Henry Akinwande firmly establish himself in the heavyweight picture by humiliating Scott Welch over 12 rounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCall threw a Christmas tree, ashtray and whisky glass past startled patrons, the police were called, placated the boxer and started to leave.  McCall wanted more, though, and spat at the officers. He was charged with vandalism, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. As a consequence, he becomes the first boxer in the history of the sport to prepare for a world title under virtual house arrest, with his drugs counsellor, Don King, and God making up an interesting coterie of supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not an unusual development in the boxing game that McCall should call on a higher influence to help him through - King, after all, has been there for him before when he needed his signature. God is new on the scene. &quot;Oliver is a warrior,&quot; McCall says in third-personspeak, &quot;a real warrior, with God behind me, with God in my corner. Lennox Lewis can have all the best trainers - Emanuel Steward, Eddie Futch, Angelo Dundee, Lou Duva, all together - he's gonna get knocked out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the concern of Home Box Office, whose money is funding McCall's bout for the vacant WBC title with Lewis at the Las Vegas Hilton, any version of McCall turning up would be a relief. Rumours swept Las Vegas last week that McCall had already pulled out, and Akinwande was ready to relinquish the WBO version and take on Lewis. King's camp issued a denial - with a subtle rider.  &quot;Oliver is already on his way to Las Vegas for the fight. As far as we know the fight is still on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What future now, for Oliver McCall, a man with a hell of a past? Good luck, Ollie.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is well, with the weekend's Davis Cup World Group tie at Durban's Westridge Park in view, to keep an eye on the quintessential cornerstone of the Russian psyche - hardship is not a new phenomenon, it is to be both expected and endured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russians go into the crucial five-match encounter suffering the double blow of being without their top player, Yevgeni Kafelnikov, and missing Alexander Volkov.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet, the doubts still linger more in the South African court than in that of the opponents who took them apart in the chill of Moscow two years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt that the Davis Cup has brought a new sense of togetherness and nationhood into the often distantly aloof business of professional tennis in this country. It is also right that this nation-on- nation tournament has given a sport which had reached its administrative nadir some respectability in the eyes of the average member of the South African sporting public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it must not be forgotten that the same competition has delivered some astounding lows, most notably when the South Africans disintegrated into the clinging red clay of Rome against the lowly ranked Italians last time out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And again this time around much hangs on the talents of Wayne Ferreira. It is an often unfair burden and, it must be added, to have played as well as he did in Rome with badly damaged feet, Ferreira showed both personal guts and determination. His subsequent vilification was as undeserved as it was unearned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is essential to the South African cause that Ferreira win both his singles encounters against Andrei Cherkasov and Andrei Chesnakov if this country is to advance to the semi-finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is asking much of a single player in what is essentially a team competition - especially as he will doubtless be expected to contest the doubles as well - but one he is used to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferreira's recent record in Davis Cup matches is also not of the quality you would expect of a man who is in and out of the world top 10, having emerged on the wrong end of the last five singles and doubles matches he has played for his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More importantly, a loss against the Russians leaves South Africa having to play-off next year to gain the all-important entry into the World round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, once again, the Ferreira factor emerges in this unhappy eventuality.  Much as he says he enjoys the honour of playing for his country, Ferriera is unlikely to want to break away from a tournament schedule which is aimed at bringing him that one step up into the real upper echelon of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It makes the equation of how Davis Cup captain Danie Visser balances the rest of his squad - Marcus Ondruska, Grant Stafford, Ellis Ferreira and Neville Godwin - even more important. We cannot continue relying on one man to make the difference .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russians have accepted their problems, and stoically gone into the tie with only three players - the third completes the trio of Andreis, Olhovsky in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is something that we could learn from and, indeed, will need should we beat the Russians and face a probable quarter-final meeting against Sweden.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE GIANT'S HOUSE by Elizabeth McCracken (Jonathan Cape, R69,95); FALL ON YOUR KNEES by Ann-Marie MacDonald (Jonathan Cape, R84,95); A RATIONAL MAN by Teresa Benison (Vintage, R62)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elizabeth McCRACKEN was chosen as one of Granta magazine's 20 best young American writers on the strength of her short story collection, Here's Your Hat, What's Your Hurry, published in 1993. She now lives up to that promise in her first novel, The Giant's House, which tells the story of a strange - not to say bizarre - love affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The novel is narrated in the cool, matter-of-fact tones of Peggy Cort, librarian and confirmed spinster at 28. She opens with the curt assertion that &quot;I do not love mankind&quot;, but in 1950 when the gangly, 11-year-old James enters her library she begins to make an important exception: &quot;I do not love mankind, but he was different.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without self-delusion or sentimentality, Peggy develops an obsession about the over-tall boy who is destined to become an eight-foot freak. Fragile and dependent, yet yearning for the life of a normal youngster, James is an unforgettable character, vividly drawn by McCracken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The severe Peggy also grows on one as the author compels us to sympathose with her outr' passion and her ruthless honesty. What emerges has something in common with Harold and Maud, but without the macabre humour and with considerably more complexity and depth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ann-Marie MacDonald's Fall on Your Knees also focuses partly on obsessive love, in this case that of a father for his eldest daughter. This massive first novel is an epic in the full sense of the word, tracing the history of a family through three generations and spanning the first half of the 20th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set on Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, the narrative also conveys the great social and economic changes that the decades bring to a pioneer society.  Counterpointing this historical perspective is a section of diary entries entitled Hejira, which superbly evokes the excitement and creativity of the jazz age in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These entries are written by Kathleen, the eldest of the four Piper sisters around whom the plot revolves. The paterfamilias, James Piper, is a complex and often unsympathetic character, but one's interest in him and his daughters seldom flags.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also encounter the family of his Lebanese wife - who resent her youthful elopement - and, even more dramatically, the Afro-American Taylors, who are inextricably linked to both families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathleen is a talented singer who goes to New York for voice training, leaving behind two younger sisters: the unruly and self-destructive Frances, and Mercedes, whose fanatical religious faith turns to ashes in the course of the narrative. The youngest and most adored of the daughters, Lily, is a semi- invalid, whose presence in the family takes on a symbolic significance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a powerful and meaty novel, skilfully controlled and lucidly written. Though it could perhaps have benefitted from some judicious editing to reduce its bulk, I think MacDonald - already a noted playwright - is well on her way to becoming a major voice in Canadian fiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teresa Benison's novel A Rational Man is also about family life and the secrets that can destroy its stability. In this case, the calm surface of Alex and Jonathan's marriage is threatened when the truth about his father suddenly emerges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This trauma frames the central section of the novel, which concerns the history of Charles, Jonathan's father. In what Alex calls an &quot;act of exhumation&quot; his experiences are revealed along with their repercussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not as monumental as Fall on Your Knees (though equally in need of some gentle cutting) nor as highly charged as The Giant's House, A Rational Man is nonetheless an impressive debut. It comes with a cover endorsement from Anita Brookner, who calls it &quot;a beguiling novel of love and infidelity&quot; - high praise indeed from so discriminating a writer and critic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - WITS: A UNIVERSITY IN THE APARTHEID ERA by Mervyn Shear (Wits University, R69)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN his history of the University of the Witwatersrand - Wits - from 1919 to the 1990s, Mervyn Shear tries to uphold the idea of a place of learning that is able to negotiate an even-handed response to a torn society. In this sense his book provides an interesting account of an attempt at order, understanding and careful negotiation, in the face of injustices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main aim of the book is to chart the movement towards an &quot;open&quot; university - towards the free admission and integration of black students in an essentially white university. Shear, who was deputy vice-chancellor responsible for student affairs during much of the 1980s, also discusses the growing vociferousness of student politics during this time, as well as attacks by the state - both physical and legislative - on students, staff and on the autonomy of the university. He concludes with a felt sense of the transformation of the university into a democratic institution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative decisions and proclamations are documented, as are the responses from student bodies and where the university stood in relation to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What emerges from beneath the figures and dates and decisions is the ongoing tension between the university's autonomy - as an institution of learning free from interference from the state and, to some measure, from society - and the competing idea of the necessity for active involvement in society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shear shows that this has never been an open-and-shut case. Wits's growing realisation of the need for transformation has always been accompanied by the need for self-preservation. What especially needed to be preserved was the university's belief in its own impartiality - which became increasingly difficult in a polarised society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wits: AUniversity in the Apartheid Era is probably as impartial as an account of Wits during the apartheid years gets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - COLONIAL SOUTH AFRICA AND THE ORIGINS OF THE RACIAL ORDER by Timothy Keegan (David Philip, R79,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WAS modern apartheid South Africa the product of the &quot;mineral revolution&quot; of gold and diamonds of the late 19th and early 20th centuries? Or do the roots go back even further into the Dutch and British colonial order?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modern South African historical scholarship has debated this issue at length. Dr Timothy Keegan of the Institute for Historical Research at the University of the Western Cape has synthesised and criticised key themes in this new history, coming up with a brilliant analytical and narrative argument for shifting the roots of apartheid back to the colonial period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone familiar with the dry-as-old-cowdung school history syllabus many of us endured will at first feel a little put off by some of the names,places and events that Keegan describes. Remember Sir Harry Smith, Governor Somerset, Dr John Philip, the 1820 settlers, Great Trek, frontier wars ? They're all here, but they appear as never before in the classroom! Moreover, Keegan sets South Africa within the wider context of world history, showing how events and ideologies overseas affected local affairs - as one would expect in any outpost of a vast colonial empire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keegan's point is that talk of the origins of the racial order is largely superfluous; the notion of European/white supremacy was there from the start as an inherent ethnocentrism. As the players in South African history came into conflict over the control of resources, various means were used to maintain colonial political and economic supremacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutch instituted a hierarchy of legal status groups and the British modernised, at times liberalising, them, in the interests of free enterprise and free trade. Humanitarian agents, like some (but definitely not all) missionaries, must be seen within this context - although they were opposed to overt oppression of slaves, Khoikhoi , Sotho, Zulu and Xhosa peoples, their project was largely one of assimilating colonised peoples into the colonial political economy, in the interests of empire and capital. Cape liberalism, when in the ascendancy during the mid- and late-19th century was an integral part of this process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, he suggests, we should reread much of the history of conflict between &quot;Bantu, Boer and Brit&quot; (to use the language of earlier historians) in these terms. Frontier wars - traditionally blamed on the Xhosa - can, on a more careful re-examination of sources, be seen as part of this colonising process, deliberate provocations on the part of the colonists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-British and illiberal views, a sense of &quot;manifest destiny&quot;,even the emancipation of slaves, can no longer be seen as causes of the Great Trek but become almost side issues; the real issues were ones of insecure land tenure and the squeeze put on the Boer economy by the rapid growth of British commercial enterprise from the 1820s onwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Boer and Brit, then, were racial supremacists. Though Boer attitudes were perhaps more racist, they were also more likely to share land with independent African communities. The British, however, were more systematic and cynical: they pursued maximum profit at minimal cost, often through indirect forms of hegemony. It was their policies, Keegan suggests, that actually hardened hierarchies of race in a way that, one must conclude, formed the basis of the apartheid state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To say that Colonial South Africa and the Origins of the Racial Order is an impressive work is understatement. It should without a doubt be a major source for educators preparing a new curriculum for schools and universities.  Unlike (sadly) many books and learned articles of its kind, it is also very well-written and extremely readable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - BRENDA FASSIE: Now Is The Time (CCP)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversial and incontrovertible Ms Brenda Fassie returns clad as the archetypal &quot;girlie&quot; raver. But don't let that put you off because this album, while ironically not as dance-oriented as her last (the Arthur-produced Umuntu Uyathintsha), is still an accomplished outing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the rhythms on Uwile and Antique are rather lightweight, they're held tightly together by Brenda's still strong voice and deep traces of melancholy, and will surely move any kwaito floor. A duet with Papa Wemba and the pop fillers are all, in atmosphere rather than quality, fine achievements. It all just goes to prove that with some top class production this lady could still be truly phenomenal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VARIOUS ARTISTS: Wipeout 2097: The Soundtrack (Virgin/EMI)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE soundtrack to the Sony Playstation game gets a surprising local release, and with the Designer's Republic's stunning sleeve wholly intact. Much like the game, the nosebleed electronica on this disc is a stomach-churning and potentially brutal affair. It features mostly British &quot;leftfield&quot; techno producers - Leftfield themselves are here, as are Orbital, Underworld and the Prodigy - who supply some thrilling dark cuts, while mad Frenchmen Daft Punk deliver up a hefty dose of over-EQed, uncut funk that'll have you wondering whether your ears are still working properly. Most impressive are the jungle contributions from Photek and Source Direct. Both are part-time members of Goldie's Metalheadz crew and their brand of scary, super-quick mania complements the game perfectly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VARIOUS ARTISTS: Trance Europe Express 5 Volume 17 (Volume)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Trance Europe Express Series has become notable for its wide open and experimental agenda. Number 5 exhibits a fresh collective of knob-twiddling talent, including Carl Cox, DJ Trace and the kitchen appliance-sampling Dr Rockit. Best of the bunch for me though comes from Russ Gabriel, who uses solid house beats to re-route some rare grooves. Volume 17 on the other hand encompasses various approaches to alternative music and does include a few dance acts. Unfortunately, the numbers from Alabama 3 (a blues-infused trip) and System 7 (a Detroit-inspired collaboration with Derrick May) sound out of place among the likes of Elastica and the Cocteau Twins. Nevertheless, there are decent contributions from Morphine, Bj&quot;rk and Curve, making this more excellent fare from the good people at Volume. Turn it up louder!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Ever sensitive to trends, especially constitutional ones, a few days of horizontality were spent listening to SAfm (104 to 107 FM), employing verticality only under duress. And one was faced with some serious questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such as: Does Vuyo Mbuli really, really like the music he plays? Where did Alyce Chavunduka get her fondness for Crosby, Stills and Nash? Why is a magazine programme called Woman Today? Does it matter? Is this the only English broadcaster doing drama? Why are there so many awful British accents around? (That one does matter.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the stronghold of Auntie Beeb (BBC) values in Africa, there are now African voices and African interest programmes in the best local twangs, along with the oddest, old-style hangovers from the past. It's a fascinating station, with a wide range of programming - minus the over-excited, hyperactive tones of certain other broadcasters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listening to SAfm is actually a bit like dealing simultaneously with a rebellious punk teenager and his middle-aged father. It ranges from the occasional very trendy, young stuff - like Michelle Constant's adventure programme Bush (Wednesday 8:30pm), to the frankly fortyish with market updates, religious programmes and loads of classical music. It does not, however, go as young as it used to. Gone is the toddler's 4pm appointment with Noddy, relegated to the merely visual confines of television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC's national English language station is still, despite loads of criticism, often a safe port in an overwhelming sea of noise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its morning news programme AM Live is ably presented by Sally Burdett and John Maytham (yes, the actor), both of them strong interviewers. Woman Today, Total Exposure and Lifestyles in the middle of the day all offer good stories and entertaining, thought-provoking material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rodney Trudgeon can be relied on to soothe your soul at 2pm with classical music, but late afternoon's PM Live could do with a touch more energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The down-side comes from some of the material chosen for dramatisation.  Wednesday night's play presentation, for example, a double bill of Mickey Mookey by Steve Walker and Diary For Jennifer Anne by Isabella Wilke, went from the awful to the riveting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first play used a grating &quot;quack-quack&quot; sound effect whenever Mickey Mookey's name was mentioned, coming over like a cross between Donald Duck and the worst of Edgar Allen Poe. Interesting, too, how regional British accents (and there are far too many of them in drama on this station) jar on the ear.  Let's hear it for African voices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second piece, A Diary for Jennifer Anne, an Artes award-winner, was provocative, disturbing and beautifully read in the rich, earthy African/Afrikaans tones of Elize Cawood. Directed by Hilary Keogh, it entered into the mind of a child-abusing mother. It was tough, muscular stuff, just the sort of thing the station needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday morning offers one of the delights of the week in Bruce Millar's The Big, Big Brunch at 10am, with comedy, music, interviews and features around the entertainment world. Graham Norton's irreverent report from London is a truly funny highlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Saturday programmes worth looking our for are Caleb Thondhlana's African Moods (noon), Richard Haslop's Roots To Fruit (1pm) and Rafe Lavine's Totally Live: And Definitely Not Unplugged at 8:30pm. For all the sports fans, there's wall-to-wall sport from 3pm to 7pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sundays at noon there's the up-beat Lunch with Africa, usually presented by Thondhlana, and The Editors, an informative, brisk and thoughtful look at the week's top stories by correspondents and editors, with Nigel Murphy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, studying the schedule, it seems there's a goldmine to discover. Who knows? One could even turn the TV off, put down that detective novel and return to the habits of childhood, when the whole family gathered around the radio, shut up for a while and let their imaginations invent the pictures ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A German musician from a punk band stared dreamily up at Kali, the dramatic, colourful Hindu goddess who boldly wears a necklace of bloodied male skulls around her neck. In a hash-induced haze, as it was Goa (India) after all, he said: &quot;Look how exciting Indian mythology is. Why is Christianity so boring?''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's not surprising that Malawi-born sculptor, Hilton Gasa (35), currently artist-in-residence at Durban's Bartle Arts Centre (Bat), specifically enrolled at The University of Bombay (with the aid of the Malawian government) to learn more about Indian art. He was smitten. &quot;I was fascinated by the drama and intricate detailing of Hindu sculptures,'' he says in his lilting Chichewa accent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not that Gasa thinks that Christian and African mythology are blatantly boring - he will make the odd Christ on the crucifix and Shaka the Zulu King - but it's just that for Gasa, being a murthi-maker, a sculptor working within the Hindu tradition, holds far more intrigue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People still think because you're black, or you're white or Indian, even though we are now a democracy, you do art of your own race. But to me it's what's spiritual to you. It may seem strange that I do mainly Indian art, and many people are amazed because I'm an African. But I am hoping through my art I can create a sense of unity. Let's learn to understand we are one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having lived in KwaZulu-Natal since the late Seventies, Gasa made the move from Malawi because: &quot;Sometimes as human beings we need a change. But I was very shocked to see people picking up a knife or a gun and killing without reason. In this country the way people are painting their blood away is quite painful to see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A poet of a man, Gasa sings sweetly: &quot;Art is your blood. Art is your memory.  Art is your thinking, pushing your power. We build the community with that power, that light. Because art is the light, and our responsibility as artists is to share that light. To increase consciousness and increase awareness. We, as artists have the fresh spirit. But really talented rural artists are lost in the community, they need support and we need cultural leaders who understand our needs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Bat providing free studio space with access to tourists milling in to view and hopefully buy Gasa's art, plus his extensive education in India and later in Italy, one would think this artist could make a modest living.  Although Gasa sells mainly to private individuals, with a modestly priced R35 figurine of Sai Baba and his highest price at R85 for the elaborately detailed figurine of Shiva, it seems Laxmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, hasn't yet blessed this artist with commissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes I wonder mwhy must I spend all my power on materials to make art that I think nobody needs. It's difficult, but Bat has really helped me. They give us wood too, so I've made a sculpture called Guardian Angel. Without their support there is no courage. I think the Department of Arts and Culture has a responsibility to pick up the artists from our new generation.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The exhibition at South Africa's National Gallery in Cape Town offers a spectrum of insights into a troubled decade. JULIA TEAL reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOOKING at the work presently on display at the South African National Gallery, there is an almost tangible sense of the weight that the institution carries as one of South Africa's main cultural arbiters. Straddled as it is between being a state institution - and thus in some sense representative of the state - and at the same time a vehicle for cultural expression, the National Gallery has, in the past, been a conduit for the state to impose, if indirectly and somewhat phlegmatically, a particular set of cultural values on the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contemporary South African Art 1985 to 1995 bears testimony to a period of significant and evolving changes in the National Gallery's relations to state and public, where the vision of artists, their comments and criticisms of their world are valued for their thought-provoking dissonance and potential to disrupt the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an effort to communicate the nature of this complex transformation to the broadest possible viewing public, the curators have installed PCs that feature statements by the director (Marilyn Martin) and the chief curator of the exhibition (Emma Bedford), as well as a penetrating interview with outgoing chair of the acquisitions committee, Neville Dubow, conducted by the new chair, Jane Taylor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This user-friendly virtual catalogue (the &quot;real&quot; one will appear later this month) also contains neat biographical inserts on the artists represented, providing one with some insight into the whys and wherefores underpinning the particular choice of works represented on this show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a whole, the exhibition offers a spectrum of personal insights and comments on the problem - and it was a problem - of what it was to be South African during this particular decade. Some of the work is directly and explicitly polemical, other work is not as deliberately provocative, but no less telling. Read together, one gets a nuanced and multi-layered visual history that records events, political and social triumphs and tragedies, and the complex underlying currents of thought and feeling that were charged by these events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although many of the works on show are aesthetically seductive, the predominant mood is critical - sometimes bitter, often bitingly humorous, occasionally lapsing into morbid sentimentality or indulging in post-modern obscurantism - and registers an intense involvement with issues that are common to humanity globally but became amplified by apartheid politics at the tip of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is precisely the haunting beauty and power of the works in the first room of the gallery that prevents one from lapsing into that familiar depression that stems from the feeling that the damage to South African society is too deep to repair, the evils perpetrated too great and the resultant poverty, inequality and lack of commitment to one another as &quot;one nation&quot; too firmly entrenched for change to be felt in real terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one moves further into the exhibition, one finds works that are wonderfully sassy and upbeat, operatic and over-the-top, highly experimental or brutally documentary - and one cannot help but feel proud, pleased and encouraged, even though the subject matter is often so dark and depressing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This era of social schizophrenia, where one sector of the population lived in a curious state of denial enthusiastically nurtured by the state, and the other lived the misery imposed by the first and struggled against it, is well covered by the exhibition as a whole, though generally from the troubled perspective of the verligte white middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heading into the 1990s, a shifting set of priorities and perceptions is evident - meditations on sexuality, HIV and abortion, pushed to the periphery during the struggle years, begin to emerge. A luta continua.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the way the exhibition has been hung tends to dilute the potential of many of the works. They are not arranged in a way that lends any kind of coherence to the history they form a part of. This kind of patchwork hanging, where often the sole criterion for arrangement appears to be scale, tends to divert from the socio-political-historical dimension of the exhibition and relegate it more to the more old-fashioned aesthetic of &quot;good taste&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is surprising in the light of recent exhibitions staged at the gallery that involved - whatever their shortcomings may have been - radical and stimulating transformations of the spaces they occupied. Exhibitions as differently oriented as Pippa Skotnes's Miscast and The Pride of the Ndebele actively interfered with the standard notions of what ought to be going on within the walls of a National Gallery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is puzzling that the rhetoric of transformation contained in the catalogue for the current exhibition was not translated more concretely into the nitty-gritty of curatoral practice. Exacerbating this problem are the labels that provide information about the works. Some do not feature the date of execution (crucial for an exhibition of this kind); occasionally they are altogether absent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is noteworthy that the collection's most overtly politicised work of this era is predominantly made by white artists, with Willie Bester's harsh assemblages of the struggles going on in the townships only emerging as late as 1990 and being purchased some time thereafter. In his interview with Emma Bedford and Jane Taylor, retiring chair of the selection committee for the gallery, Neville Dubow, describes the difficulty experienced in convincing the board of directors to allow work into the collection that would &quot;rock the boat&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, through what Dubow neatly refers to as &quot;Trojan horse&quot; tactics of subterfuge, the work was somehow collected, or at least some of it was.  Polemical work by black artists is markedly absent, a disturbing gap and one not easily explained away by stories of censorship and oppressive bureaucracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dubow describes how it was the unstated view of the board of directors that the work being made in the townships during the 1980s and falling into the category of &quot;township style&quot; was at the time considered to be too &quot;commercial&quot; for the gallery. Some was purchased, but not much. It may have been a good idea to represent some of these works at the exhibition. These could have provided yet another dimension to the history that underpins the exhibition as a whole, reflecting the irony that artists could turn their oppression and exploitation to advantage - even if it were only a short-term cash one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This points to a deeper set of contradictions that became apparent in trying to reconcile the stated aims of the director and curator with the work on show. In their respective statements, there is an embrace of concepts of nationhood and the desire for the gallery to function as an active, if critically alert, agent within the formation of such an identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the permanent collection is dominated by the work of white artists and by the priorities and debates of &quot;white art&quot; is not adequately acknowledged or interrogated in the catalogue or within the format of the exhibition itself. The absence, for instance, of a policy of retroactive collecting of the political posters and prints of the struggle years suggests the collection will, at least for the moment, remain within this ambit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contemporary South African Art 1985 to 1995 is on now at the National Gallery in Cape Town</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margaret Vorster's beautiful three-piece pastel drawing, Sleep of Treason, takes the tradition of the allusive self-portrait and weaves a story about the way in which the self is implicated in larger brutalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also pleasing to see seminal works on the collection like Jane Alexander's Butcher Boys resonating with other works made during the first five years of the period documented by the exhibition. The tendency to use the work as a sensational drawcard has for some time been threatening to dissipate its considerable impact. Seen in relation to works by artists like Paul Stopforth, Diane Victor, Keith Deitrich and Stanley Pinker, one gets a feel for the &quot;Weimar-ish&quot; ethos that produced this sculpture - a period of decadence and despair, on one hand, and brave struggle in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds on the other.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The sister of pianist David Helfgott has mounted an extraordinary attack on Shine, the critically acclaimed film which tells his life story. Margaret Helfgott, who lives in Israel, has sent a British newspaper a detailed account to demonstrate that the portrayal of the relationship between her late father Peter, and David, her younger brother who suffered a major breakdown which severely disrupted his career, is &quot;a complete travesty&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margaret Helfgott says: &quot;There are totally fictitious scenes created to show my father as an unfeeling and brutal man, who drove David insane&quot;. Her brother Leslie and her mother Rachel have strongly objected to the film portrayal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev Bob Fairman, director of a residential care centre where the pianist lived for seven years after Peter's death and his subsequent breakdown, says that David never made a derogatory remark about his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all of David's family believe the film is a travesty. Two of his other sisters, Suzie and Louise, are keeping silent, while Gillian, his wife, played by Lynn Redgrave in Shine, says: &quot;We should feel sorry for Margaret.  Scott Hicks made the film with dignity and integrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Helfgott himself is keeping quiet, although Margaret Helfgott maintains this is because he is controlled by his wife.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Shine has been called the 'best film you'll see in 1997' but its dramatisation of the truth has been questioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADELAIDE, Western Australia, May, 1986: Kerry Hicks had a memorable birthday that year. She and her husband Scott were expecting friends for dinner, to celebrate. The scene was set for a convivial but hardly unusual evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until, that is, Scott, an established film-maker, read in the local newspaper of an eccentric pianist who had survived a mysterious &quot;illness&quot; to return to the recital trail. The man was playing in Adelaide that night.  Hicks felt he had to attend. He listened and marvelled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result, 10 years in the making, was Shine, the unlikely story of a deranged pianist, which is already on course to become one of the most talked- about movies of 1997. With its bittersweet theme of destructive and redeeming love, Shine tells the tale of childlike genius David Helfgott. But the story behind the story - the making of the film - is almost as compelling. The narrative includes some potent cinematic myths: a director with a dream, a virtually unknown star, an unseemly wrangle over distribution rights, and controversy over the film's version of the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Something - I don't know what - compelled me to skip Kerry's supper that night and attend that recital. I'm glad I did,&quot; says Hicks. &quot;She's since forgiven me. I remember I came away from the recital feeling like you do when you've seen a good film. It was an extraordinary experience.&quot; What intrigued him is evident from his biopic. David Helfgott is no thin-blooded interpreter of the piano repertoire. He hums, grimaces and laughs while he performs. His interpretations are not purist: notes or lines occasionally go missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was &quot;like Groucho Marx on speed&quot;, Hicks recalls.&quot; I was captivated by the mix of man and music.&quot; Helfgott has also been known to wander down to the audience and kiss and hug anyone within reach. It is as though he has lost whatever restrains our innermost impulses. Despite, or because, of that he plays like an angel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, Hicks found himself face to face with a conundrum. What lay behind this extraordinary anomaly - a shambling, virtually incoherent idiot-savant who played Rachmaninov, Chopin and Liszt so beautifully? Who were the key figures in his life? Where had Helfgott disappeared to for a decade? Shine offers a few answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helfgott, born in 1947, was one of four artistic children of Polish-Jewish Holocaust survivors, who fled to near-poverty in Perth, Western Australia.  His domineering father drove his son to succeed at the piano, but dissolved in anger when David's talent took him to Britain on a scholarship. At graduation, Helfgott tackled the technical and emotional demands of Rachmaninov's Third Piano Concerto, collapsed, and entered a 10-year netherworld of psychiatric wards and hostels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the road again to recovery and recitals, he married and rebuilt his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that ground-breaking 1986 comeback tour, it took Hicks - now 44 - many months to gain Helfgott's confidence and that of his equally extraordinary wife and manager, Gillian. Hicks regularly travelled the 600km between Adelaide and Perth to interview the pianist and hear him play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This sounds simple, but it was an achievement because of the way Helfgott talks. Hicks constructed a screenplay, Flight of the Bumblebee. It wouldn't do. It was mundane, too &quot;TV movie&quot;. In came screenwriter Jan Sardi to craft something finer, the screenplay that came to be filmed as Shine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was now 1991, five years since Hicks had first met Helfgott. Shine was still only halfway to celluloid. The script was no longer literal: it took liberties, just as Helfgott takes liberties with music. According to Hicks, the film depicts &quot;being eaten alive by a piano&quot;, by the formidable bulk and terrible maw of an open concert grand on stage. &quot;No wonder they go crazy,&quot; Hicks exclaims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Shine was on paper, and in Hicks's head. He had not yet found finance, turning to Jane Scott, producer of Jane Campion's debut box-office wonder My Brilliant Career. Scott raised the necessary $6 million; she and Hicks resisted the pleas of financiers to involve more big-name stars. Hicks saw that that would loosen the emotional grip of the film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was right. Three actors play David Helfgott - child, teenager and adult - each virtual unknowns. The youngest David, victim of a father who loves not wisely but too well, is Alex Rafalowicz, struggling to conclude a competition piece as the piano rolls symbolically away downstage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenage David, who escapes his concentration camp of a home to study at London's Royal College of Music, is played by Noah Taylor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geoffrey Rush, a graduate of the Lecoq school of mime in Paris, plays Helfgott as an adult. Rush learned every stammer, repetition, gasp and &quot; whooah&quot; of Helfgott's deranged but systematically scripted soliloquies.  Nothing was improvised. Aware that nothing convinces less than a film &quot; pianist&quot; whose hands flutter meaninglessly over the ivories, Rush honed a credible piano technique. The soundtrack is played by the real-life Helfgott, but it never shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rush explains: &quot;I'm not a pianist ... but if you play Hamlet, you've got a sword fight at the end of the play.&quot; If you can't convince in that, you've thrown away the final act. So with Shine. At various stages, the adult Helfgott has had a caffeine addiction - scores of cups of tea a day - to put the PG chimps in the shade, and smoked like Marlboro Man. He played the piano, and, bizarrely, swam lengths of the pool, for hours on end. His nervous energy was, and is, prodigious.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How to do him justice? Rush clearly succeeded. The story goes that after Helfgott saw the final cut of Shine for the first time, he bounded up to Hicks, trilling the single word, &quot;Brrrilliantissimo!&quot; So, Hicks had his film.  He had Helfgott's approval. What he didn't have was a distributor. The movie's first public screening was at the United States's Sundance Film Festival in January. The result? &quot;All hell broke loose,&quot; recalls Hicks. &quot; Suddenly there was this feverish frenzy to lay claim to the film.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other controversies were to follow. Helfgott's father, played with devastating emotional force by Armin Mueller-Stahl, is at the centre of the film: the power of his performance comes from the anguished contradictions apparent in the desperate, but severe tenderness the elder Helfgott shows his son. He bullies and terrorises, because he wants &quot;to keep the family together&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travesty, cry members of the late Peter Helfgott's family (he died in 1975).  David's sister Margaret wrote to Australian papers condemning Shine's &quot; unfair and inaccurate&quot; portrayal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film's second controversy involves another change that has been made for dramatic effect. In life, a far-sighted doctor, Chris Reynolds, brought Helfgott out of his twilight world. Shine, however, credits Helfgott's emotional and musical renaissance to a lesser character. In life as in fiction, Helfgott is a holy fool (and the first to admit it) whose relationship to experience is indiscriminate. Hicks defines the pianist as &quot;a force of nature&quot;. &quot;A near genius&quot; is how Helfgott's teacher at London's Royal School of Music, played in Shine by John Gielgud, described his pupil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is, how many of those who go, and will go, to his concerts, do as a result of seeing Shine? How many will hope for a mid-concert hug and a kiss? Does his personality overshadow the music? Is he something of a freak show? And does it matter?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people are attracted to his music who wouldn't otherwise attend classical concerts,&quot; says Hicks. &quot;But that's wholly positive.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - For the next two weeks, Gallery Mau Mau in Cape Town shifts focus from the ostentation of the art world to the thrill of B-schlock, exploitation filmography and pure horror. Amid projections and popcorn, administrators David L Dei and Craig E Parker describe the ensemble as &quot;a terrorism of the senses that explodes our consciousness with an antidote to conventional cinema&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interspersed with freak love affairs, nudist films deemed sexually not stimulating, and Ultravixens running around in one-piece crocheted body suits because &quot;tits sell&quot;, Mau Mau's cine-art experience traces film back to a time when such celluloid standards were deemed unfit for family viewing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Projections season makes the lack of change in film content over the last 50 years apparent. It is mainly attitudes regarding the material that have altered. Viewed with morbid fascination back then, the pulp cinema content of our times has merely moved from the shelf of the fringe to the projector of the mainstream. A marked improvement in technology has resulted in better special effects, as the subject matter of current films remains constant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Animation on show from around the world includes Dog Boy, an adaptation of the comic series by Charles Burns, and short films by Richard Kern from his Death Trip series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andy Warhol's aesthetic will also be on show as Frankenstein, companion to his famed Dracula. Banned in South Africa, Pier Paulo Pasolini's Salo: The 120 Days of Sodom, will have its debut in the exhibition space turned movie hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Chinese films, Oni Baba and Chinese Ghost Story, explore the Eastern attitude to fantasy horror and the respectfully daunting manner in which they hallow the dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From the camp appeal of sexual diversity to the sleaze of bodily exploitation, the thread that links the films on show is that of independence.  The movies demonstrate exactly how individual viewpoints surface regardless of censorship. The festival further displays how cinema can challenge the moral code of a particular time and then slowly mutate it into the acceptable.  Parker explains that this demonstrates how challenge to the norm promotes change and stimulates the ideas of a society's state of mind, resulting in a reviewed system of ethics. He maintains that a reaction to the norm always moves on to become popular culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The festival opens on February 10, at 6pm at the Mau Mau. Screenings will take place from Monday to Thursday at 7pm and 9.30pm; preceded by shorts</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The millennium's closing down. DROREYAL on white kids who wear black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SATURDAY night at The Fridge, deep in the doomed megalopolis of Gauteng.  They gather inside an empty warehouse. Black covers them from head to toe.  From jeans and T-shirts to leather, chains, velvet and PVC. Vampire chic.  Couture of the undead. There are glimpses of tattoos and body piercings in the half-light of a video projector. This is the goth revival. I step inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, get out your hair products - gothic music is back. Fed on steroids and mutated for the Nineties, goth has returned for the second round.Why now? Why resurrect it? Goth is dead. I saw it being buried at Doors when The Mission took the stage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goth is more than just funny hairstyles. To some degree, gothic music represents an attempt by musicians to come to terms with advances in technology. The insertion of ritual into the machine. Wicca, esoterrorism, magick, role-playing, vampires - all are combined with up-to-the-minute technology for modern rituals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More importantly, it constitutes a psychological bulwark against the pre- millennial tension of microtechnology, bio-interfaces, wetware and nanotechnology. The day when we become technology, rather than merely use it, may not be far away. The goths are rebelling, drawing on the metaphorical resources of the darker, more primitive side of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday night at The Fridge. Hey, have you seen the ball dancers? Where? I negotiate the mass of whirling arms, spilling my beer on a rather large goth who doesn't seem very amused, but hey, neither was Kafka. Then I see them. A trio of shamans are performing a bizarre ritual with a ball. Long elastic lines are attached to their suits. The ball floats in the centre. They are connected to it. Lights flicker, shadows move across the walls. They dance to the tribal beat of Sheep on Drugs. I stare as the ball rises, drops, bounces and twists. This is Agency 23, a collection of artists who perform rituals to define the everyday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, it is only through technology that the goths are able to get back to more primitive times. It is through the use of videos, digitally- enhanced tribal drumming, synthesized shamanistic rituals, hypodermic needles puncturing skin and tribal tattoos, that urban rituals are formed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday night at The Fridge. We dance facing the stage. There is no eye contact. It's hot. I can feel sweat trickling down my back. A car alarm goes off, followed by police sirens. We dance faster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this is not some Baudrillardian fantasy. This is Johannesburg: more violent crimes per nanosecond than anywhere else in the world, home of carjackers, computer hackers, Nigerian drug dealers and suspected vampires, The Fridge and Sub-Zero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sub-Zero is the latest in a line of goth clubs that spans The Cramps, Subway, Delizium, The Temple and Decodance. Dark and gloomy, as befits any self-respecting goth, Sub-Zero is the hangout of choice for those waiting for the millennium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not content to reside only in Johannesburg, goth's tentacles spread across SA. Durban's resort appeal is rejected by the thrashing mass of black-clad apostles at The Station, substituting skintight latex for baggy shorts and undernourished physiques for tanned bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is no escaping the seaside aesthetic, and Durban-based DFG make music for sing-alongs around radioactive beach fires. Eerie shipwrecks, drowning sailors and typhoons set to a steamshovel beat all join together to form this particular zeitgeist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town's River Club hosted this year's Slamfest, where worshippers gathered to bang their heads to the toxic sounds of bands like Driven To Kill, Nailed and Prayer - Christian hardcore bands that owe more to the Spanish inquisition than Sunday School. These guitar torturers combine an evangelistic mindset with a pounding four-four rhythm kicked into the up- tempo speed metal stratosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their music gurgles like blood sluicing through rubber hoses. Tired of the soft image that Christianity has acquired and tired of being mocked, they have adopted old testament might: believe or suffer. Goth culture has always subverted Christian images and mythologies. Now these bands are claiming them back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday night at the Fridge. It's hot. I look for my beer. Hey, someone stole my beer. The beat speeds up and reaches a techno intensity. Images of blood and gore flicker on the video screen, like some solemn dress rehearsal for the apocalypse. Too fast for me. I take a break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disillusioned with the rave scene's unfulfilled promises, edged by a millennial pessimism, many of today's goths are the ravers of yesterday.  Lured by the repetitive pounding beats, dark iconography, and danceability of the new gothic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How happy can you be dancing to a pounding house beat, knowing that your car has a good chance of being stolen by the time you go out? How much E do you have to take to forget that it's 1997? Remember technomuffins, only 893 shopping days left to the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Nineties, classical goth emerges as disco with an edge: dance floor anarchy. It's souped-up with autopsy imagery, tortured samples, rap and speed- metal drum programming, and a production style that pushes needles into the red.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the South African goth scene is not just mimicking sounds from Europe.  The roots of at least one group of artists sink deep into local tradition.  Working from indigenous mythologies, Insurrection carve a sound that can only be described as African death metal. Incorporating Zulu war dancing, gumboot dancing and the gloomiest sounds to emerge from the wrong end of a guitar.  Umnikelo (sacrifice), their first single, is a gut-churning testimony to the death of Africa. This is no Paul Simon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday night at The Fridge. A blast of unbearably loud feedback screeches out of the speakers. I check my eardrums, but there's no blood. The sonic feedback continues and the current high priests of anti-social insecurity, Battery 9, take the stage. The rest of the tribe answers this mating call and gathers in front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I consider making a run for it, but it's too late. I am stuck between an over-energetic cyberhippie and a black-haired gothling. I close my eyes and watch as a keyboard gets sucked into a jet engine and spat out as circuitry.  Its death agonies form the relentless beat. A distorted voice floats over it, urging, demanding: &quot;Kiss the machine&quot;. My legs move. I reach for my beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formed in 1995, after various incarnations as Breinskade and Joos Tonteldoos en die Dwarstrekkers, Battery 9 draw inspiration from sources as diverse as the South African Defence Force and Afrikaans mythology. Their live stage show is a post-apocalyptic concoction of neo-primitive instruments made from discarded car parts, industrial waste, and synthesizers. Put together from the offcasts of society, their music slips slyly between satire and social commentary in English and Afrikaans, spanning a mythology that draws on an African heritage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new gothic is machines playing live. It's a fold of tattooed pierced flesh caught in the zip of a black leather jacket. It's a bottle-black hair flying to a Bauhaus song. It's a pair of bones, a crucifix, a Nine Inch Nails T-Shirt, black hairdye, clothes dye, shoe dye, eyeshadow, eyeliner ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday night at The Fridge. The machines are playing live and the atmosphere is white hot, but when it comes right down to it, it's just another cultural movement flexing its muscles.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Even now, at 40, Andy Sheppard looks like the art student he never became. His hair is spiky, his eyes focused on some distant, as-yet- unpainted, landscape. What changed his 16-year-old life was the recordings of John Coltrane. Suddenly, he found his music - jazz - and his instrument, the saxophone. But he didn't lose the artist's ear for space.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheppard's fourth recording In Co-Motion (Antilles - there's now a discography of seven as a leader) has been described as &quot;like opening a country cottage door and finding it backs on to endless vistas of African savannah&quot;. As a sideman, he's worked with those space-merchants among leaders, George Russell, Gill Evans and Carla Bley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the United Kingdom-born player, composer and arranger is here, with keyboard colleague Steve Lodder, scanning the horizon for South African musicians to work with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two, plus rhythm, make up In Co-Motion, a group that has already toured extensively (including Nigeria, where they kidnapped a talking-drum player to add to the sound) and forms the nucleus of a number of other large and small groups. &quot;The group I bring together for my South African tour (in April) could be any size, any format. I want to work with musicians here who can bring their own ideas and approaches - and their own music - as well as working with my charts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we'll need to share is a common approach: a preparedness to make space in which all the players can express themselves. There's a lot of improvisation in my music, but also melody and groove. While George Russell described jazz as 'a certain kind of energy', for me it's also about a certain kind of communication which allows players to move through the same time together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That communication in spirit was what the young Sheppard had found lacking in rock. And it's what, today, makes him cautious about collaborating with acid jazz players or with the high-profile pop performers like Portishead who work around his home base in Bristol. &quot;Music that's heavily engineered bypasses the live process of collective creation. When you're a jazzman, you try and play it different every time - that's your job. Sometimes, you fail.  But taking that risk also gives you the opportunity for stunning recoveries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheppard and Lodder agree that risk and edge are essential characteristics of the music they love to play. So both have strong reservations about the studio cliches of acid jazz (&quot;Although,&quot; says Lodder, &quot;some great sounds have come out of hours at a desk.&quot;) and the strict traditionalism of jazz's new neoclassicists. &quot;Marsalis is a superb player technically,&quot; says Sheppard. &quot; But in the school that's grown up around him, there are too few risks being taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a jazzman,&quot; says Lodder, &quot;you always need to go beyond what you already know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two are also building an acoustic quartet in London, with its own repertoire of new music. The British Council has brought them to South Africa to meet players and plan out the tour. Since he's already worked with South Africans Louis Moholo and Claude Deppa, Sheppard knows there's musical energy and talent here. Now, it's just finding the right mix.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - MARIA McCLOY talks to Skeem, a bright new South African group who are mixing styles and doing their own musical thing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SKEEM broke on to the local music scene in September last year with the release of their song Waar Was Jy? In terms of both lyrics and style they were a breath of fresh air after a period when things on the South African dance edge were threatening to become repetitive. Though rooted in a mixture of today's pumping house beats, ragga and rap, the song took people back to the Eighties - a time when, as band member Ishmael says: &quot;Brenda Fassie was running things.&quot; Her Weekend Special and Mercy Pakela's Aya Shisa amaTekkie were the radio staples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where were you,&quot; they ask, back in the days of Lapologa on TV3? The weekly dose of pantsula dancers, ballroom dancers and anxious folk miming along to some or other Michael Jackson song? Waar Was Jy? refers to the things that were a part of the four group members' lives when they were kids; Jomo Sono's Pirates and Spiderman make it into the mix, as do references to the hits Chaklas Chaklas, Skoro-Skoro, Chicco's Soldier, perms, pantsulas and breakdance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucky, Jacob and Ishmael grew up together in Rustenberg. In 1991 they created Brown Bread Connection with Boom Shaka's Junior, in 1992 Junior and Ishmael joined Prophets of da City. Lucky and Jacob's Bass Tribe faded and they ended up as dancers for Jimmy B and then moved to DJing in Rockey Street clubs. Last year the three guys were joined by Teba and Skeem was formed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past seven years independent label Ku Shu Shu Music has been working on Cape Town rap group Prophets of da City. The Prophets returned from Europe and, as the press release has it, &quot;decided to work on some beats for Lucky and Jacob. Jacob flew down to Cape Town with Ishmael to hook up with Ready D and Shaheen from POC ... then it was back to Johannesburg to lay the voices down.&quot; The first product that Ku Shu Shu's sub-label Ghetto Ruff released was Skeem's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ishmael is still with Prophets, but as a member of Skeem he's not on a ragga or rap tip, instead he sings - and not about anything political. Just looking at him you can tell he does his own thing; funky ripped army trousers, yellow Nike sports shoes and, resting on his blondish tinted hair, a pair of trendy silver shades. Dreadlocked Jacob barely says a word. Teba who does the ragga bits is not there and Lucky, who seems to be the joker of the crew, explains the &quot;meaning&quot; of some of the tracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way Ishmael sees it the band, aged between 21 and 25, started out in order to &quot;do something different ... we've always been doing hip-hop ...  never anything 100% local.&quot; Also, they wanted to bring something different to the local scene: they say they will never use dancing girls or wear matching uniforms while doing synchronised moves as a gimmick to attract crowds, They say they just want to be themselves. &quot;We're roughnecks us ... we don't do the routine. You have too feel the music,&quot; says Lucky before Ishmael chips in: &quot; We don't dance. We want the crowd to dance; we deliver the message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skeem is &quot;definitely not hip-hop. Hip hop is rap music, graffiti, breakdance, &quot; says Ishmael, though he acknowledges the influence of hip-hop and ragga in their sound. So what is it? &quot;Gong.&quot; Some use the words kwaito and degong to refer to the same thing (township dance music). Lucky thinks their music is slower; slow enough to nod your head to. Ishmael says: &quot;'It's like kwaito is like yesterday and gong is like today.&quot; According to them Bongo Maffin, Alaska and Trompies are proponents of gong too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zumba is the name Lucky uses to describe the mixture of South African languages they use in their music. He calls it a &quot;broken language to accommodate all.&quot; It's words and tones from a variety of languages being spliced and put together. Ishmael wishes there was space made in the music business for &quot;ragga in Zulu or hip-hop in Zulu or Sotho ... even jungle&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difficulties Prophets of da City experienced in the South African music scene are well known - lack of radio play and banning of their records and videos. Ishmael believes many hip-hop groups are still underground and battling to get signed because record companies &quot;don't believe that hip-hop will make it big locally&quot;. This contrasts with the kwaito sounds that pump from every radio, taxi and club, and the fact that a debut tune like Waar Was Jy? sold 35 000 copies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Skeem's creation might just have been an economic decision. Ishmael points out that it is, after all, a business: &quot;We're doing this music to pay the rent, and for the love of it.&quot; All members of the group are critical of the lack of creativity in kwaito/degong, they diss the South African record industry for stifling talent and ideas by making emerging artists make kwaito tracks they think will sell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skeem say they haven't been in such a situation because they have been working with and promoted by people who have known them for years. Either way the other five tracks on Skeem's Waar Was Jy? album are nowhere near as good as the title track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skeem criticise distributors for not making their music available to other African countries while the huge pirating industry is doing the job for them.  They're critical of company representatives who don't make music available at township outlets, though they won't mention names. Kwaito artists also come in for a major diss because they copy overseas acts and ideas. There are British groups called Boom Shanka and Abashanti; some songs sound eerily like they got their beats from the US. &quot;There's no originality, so stop saying you're original,&quot; says Lucky. The way Skeem see it, &quot;biting&quot; (criticising) has now also become an inter-state thing, they won't mention names again, but have had enough of the &quot;chain reaction&quot;of one person having a hit single and the next thing a new group arrives and has named itself after that hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The content and beats of the album concentrate on making people dance and laugh, but they claim that in their new album they'd like to talk about things like police corruption and how freely available guns are - but in an entertaining way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More intriguing is the upcoming Waar Was Jy jungle remix . Things should go well if they stay true to their stated desire for originality and creativity, because like one of Skeem's friends told me: &quot;local music could do with some soul.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Ghetto Diaries, the award-winning M&amp;G-TV series, starts a new season. ANDREW WORSDALE previews</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN I was asked to cover the new series of Mail &amp; Guardian Television's Ghetto Diaries I told editorial and filmic staff there was no way I could write a review as an advertorial. I was concerned that I may be inveigled, being a film-maker myself, into some criticism flavoured by corporate favouritism. Listen, I need this newspaper job. I haven't made a movie for about 10 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I didn't see the first four programmes that won awards in Zimbabwe and were highly praised in the United Kingdom and Holland. But the follow-up - a collection of six programmes collectively titled Across the Divide, has moments that should make any documentary film-maker or feature film-aspirant sit up and take notice. The content, form and aesthetic are highly cinematic - for television and especially for documentaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A friend of mine hates documentaries. She says: &quot;It's all fixed. It's always a contrived story told from the film-maker's point of view.&quot; She's right, but what's different about Ghetto Diaries is that the subject is also the film-maker. What you see is invigorating and visionary although the film- makers are all novices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa has developed a great tradition of documentary film-making and absolutely no heritage of fiction or feature films. The reason is thoroughly political. In the mid-to-late-Eighties, film-makers like Angus Gibson, Lawrence Dworkin, Mark Newman, Jeremy Nathan and Harriet Gavshon - she is head of M&amp;G-TV and executive producer of the series - found themselves making pieces of historical artefact. Their films explored the legacies and horrors of apartheid and told foreigners, mainly, about South African history for the first time. The results were edifying but boring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite South Africans' expertise in recording social and political history, most of the documentaries made here have toed the line and been excruciatingly politically correct, exploring content instead of context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So a large part of the unique flavour of South African life has been lost to diatribe, didacticism and explaining the paradoxes, ironies and contradictions the country to foreign viewers (because Channel 4, the BBC or some obscure Swedish funding organisation was paying). The results are predictable, sympathetic, laudable documents of our history that, despite their dullness, helped create the environment for the transformation evident in Ghetto Diaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gavshon says the idea of video diaries came to her when Johnathan Miller, then head of local production company Free Filmmakers, initiated a long-term development project called Palestinian Diaries, where youngsters were given bulky video cameras) before the home video revolution) and asked to record their troubled lives across the notorious Middle East divide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gavshon says: &quot;We were inspired by that and after Ordinary People it seemed a logical way to progress.&quot; Ordinary People, a 32-part series that chronicled events through the eyes of three or four &quot;normal&quot; people, ran for three seasons on SABC and garnered much praise, John Van Zyl, head of TV and Media Studies at Wits University, wrote: &quot;It has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in documentary. It reaches back to the oppositional film- making of the Seventies and Eighties and looks forward to recording the development of a new South African society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young film-maker Teboho Mahlatsi, a graduate of the African Cultural Centre, proposed the first series. In many ways it was a one-off take on a neighbourhood, White City in Soweto, where he lives. The unself-conscious nature of the films made them an instant critical and popular success. To the SABC's credit, Gavshon acknowledges, they were screened on Prime Time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British version, Video Diaries, are screened around 10pm and are made over about a year, with the editing process lasting five to six months. &quot;We just don't have the money or resources to do that,&quot; says Gavshon. &quot;We're much more a guerrilla style of film-making. We train for a week and then leave the subject alone to shoot the piece over two weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor Robbie Thorpe says: &quot;The British videos are more polished but with our series you get a real sense that people are filming themselves. They don't know they're breaking conventional cinematic laws ... and they're constantly inventing new techniques through intuition. In the first series one of the film-makers concealed his camera under his arm so his subjects wouldn't be self-conscious. We got all these fantastically weird Dutch tilts and strange angles that really worked well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the new series, coordinated by Mahlatsi, helped by Lance Gewer, Dingaan Thomas Kapa and Msizi Kuhlane, a narrative tension has been created by cross- cutting between characters. So Lucky Mncegke, a mine-worker in Johannesburg and Lombasa, his wife, who lives in Ngqeleni near Umtata, both record their daily lives. Some of the material is startlingly realised - like a perfectly framed shot of Lombasa chopping wood with their young child in the foreground.  This is contrasted with Lucky's equally classic framing of life on the mines: he's in low angle in front of the mine workers' hostel, and tracks to where he introduces the viewer to his dwelling and to the belly of the Western Deep Levels mine. At one moment Lombasa is seen carrying a bucket of water and she talks to the camera: &quot;How many people can carry water and film themselves at the same time?&quot; Behind her, a friend is seen carrying the tripod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An aesthetic contrast is the story of Victor Zulu, an IFP hostel-dweller, whose film opens with a brilliant shot of a pair of trousers on a washing line blowing into the camera. It develops into a rough-hewn look at his life, filled with shaky hand-held shots and a real cinematic energy that's completely germane to the grimy context of his daily grind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new approach in Ghetto Diaries makes the series more compelling.  Perhaps the style of the films is so startling because these are not trained film-makers and the stories are told from an insider's point of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahlatsi is editing a 52-minute version of the first series for Swedish TV.  Called White City, Black Lives, it features the first series's participants reflecting on the experience of making their films and the representation of black lives in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Soweto has always been represented by outsiders as a city of death ...  violent, passionate and noble death in the pursuit of freedom. But when we gave cameras to people in Soweto to make films about their own lives we realised that death has many faces, and life has many facets,&quot; says Mahlatsi.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, Lionel Mtshali, this week finally announced the list of who will be serving on the most powerful arts body yet established in post-apartheid South Africa, the National Arts Council (NAC). But, while general reaction to the list has been favourable, there is some concern about procedure: normally such a council would be established along guidelines laid down by a parliamentary Bill. In the case of the NAC, the National Arts Council Bill governing it has yet to emerge from Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means councillors are accepting three-year positions without finalisation of their duties. While the draft Bill has been approved by Parliament, the final version is subject to ratification by the Cabinet's Arts and Culture Portfolio Committee. This is headed by seasoned cultural worker Mongane Wally Serote, who is known to stand in opposition to several arts initiatives taken by the government and independent bodies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the only hiccup on the road to a non-salaried body that will, ultimately, control state funding of the arts. After open hearings in November last year, 32 candidates were shortlisted to 18. But then the process slowed down as the ministry and its accompanying department locked horns over the composition of the 12-person council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another dilemma posed by the names released this week concerns actor and administrator John Kani. Kani is on the board of the Arts and Culture Trust and is managing trustee of the Market Theatre as well as chair of the Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal (Pact) board. A potential conflict of interest arises in that, as a Pact and Market representatitive, he will effectively be applying to the NAC for funds for these organisations. He may well find himself having to resign from the Pact board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The names released this week are, according to an insider, &quot;the best of an overall average set of applicants&quot;. Governed by a set of criteria regarding race, gender and discipline - the list is 50% white, 50% black; 40% female, 60% male - the options were in any case limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only remaining discrepancy regarding composition of the council is that the vast majority of candidates - eight - come from Gauteng. A further three hail from KwaZulu-Natal and one from the Western Cape, but nine candidates are still to be named, each representing a region. These will be filled by the chairperson of the arts council of each province. In cases such as the Western Cape, though, where no such provincial body exists, such decisions will be taken by the province's executive committee. Rumour has it that the Western Cape's representative will be theatre owner Pieter Toerien.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, combined with the launch of Business Arts South Africa, an initiative to attract corporate funding of the arts, the establishment of the council is a massive breakthrough in a traditionally neglected sector of South African life. Another insider called the new developments &quot;nothing short of a miracle&quot;. A chairperson for the committee will be selected within a month at the council's first meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the names</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Gillian Farquhar and Jacquie Golding-Duffy report on whether advertising agents are adapting their creative work in an effort to keep up to date with changes locally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE &quot;new&quot; South Africa born two-and-a-half years ago has brought with it a different set of social and cultural dynamics into the advertising arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An industry which was predominantly white in several sectors: media planning, strategy, buying and directorships - for many years, has now been forced to adapt to the changes in the consumer market and start recognising the large bulk of potential black consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether South Africa's advertising agencies have kept pace with the demands of the black consumer market in the new era is debatable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertising analyst John Farquharson recently charged that the industry's advertising creativity was lagging behind the reality of the market-place.  Too much of today's advertising still reflects &quot;first world&quot; creative thinking and &quot;Eurocentric&quot; marketing concepts that are ineffectual in the &quot; black&quot; market, he says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The language subtleties and nuances that drive Eurocentric marketing miss the mark when aimed at consumers of other cultures. Advertisers should express themselves within a more 'Afrocentric' paradigm but ultimately aim to produce ads in the idiom of this country,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, while many advertising agencies agree that creating a &quot;South African idiom&quot; in advertising is the way forward, they also point out that &quot;talking in broad strokes about the industry is inappropriate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why? Because the approach agencies take is gauged on the specifics of product and target audience and, therefore, broad advertising does not always meet market needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media director of advertising agency Bosman Johnson, John van Niekerk, says market research shows that bigger differences are often found between age and class and rural and urban consumers than between different culture groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Head of black-controlled advertising agency Herdbouys, Peter Vundla, agrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argues that there is still an &quot;inordinate emphasis&quot; on western values in advertising, adding that the issue is not a straightforward one of &quot; Eurocentric versus Afrocentric&quot;. The industry should aim for &quot;an eclectic approach&quot; by drawing on all South Africa's cultures to create a common &quot;South Africanism&quot; in advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To get to the South African advertising idiom, advertising creative directors and others in the industry must understand the country's diverse cultures. However, the majority of advertisers do not, says Vundla. He adds that most advertisers are often unable to digest the array of cultures in the country and are unable to sell some of their products to the black consumer because they are misinformed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They (advertisers) are out of touch at a certain level with black consumers,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some media observers agree with Vundla, arguing that there still exists a tendency in the advertising market to target difference rather than commonality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some advertisers simply solve their problem (of finding a common framework) by creating separate ads for black and white markets. Despite the fact that the industry claims to be spending more on market research then ever before, prejudices do slip through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the pair of Palmolive adverts first flighted last year: both feature a woman soaping herself in the bath and singing. She then suddenly realises she is not alone in the bathroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the advertisement aimed at black consumers, it's the woman's child who disturbs her. In the version featuring the white model, it is the partner who is looking on admiringly. A former Herdbouys department director, Happy Ntshingila, questioned the &quot;thinking that sex doesn't sell to blacks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another example of adapting adverts according to race is the Tedelex advertisement in which the advert, aimed at black consumers, shows a man watching television while his furniture is being repossessed. He only reacts to what is happening around him when the television set is removed. &quot;This shows a clear misunderstanding of African culture,&quot; says Ntshingila. &quot;In the township there is nothing funny or amusing about having furniture repossessed.  It happens to people every day and it's very embarrassing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lindsay Smithers creative director Nick Walsh admits that the industry is sometimes at fault, adding that there is a &quot;strong desire&quot; to bring black creators in to create the necessary balance and insight. Walsh argues that despite criticism of the industry, many of South Africa's most popular adverts have come out of &quot;white&quot; agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vundla concedes that the industry is &quot;waking up&quot; and changing for the better. Perhaps a good indicator of this is the emergence of a specifically new South Africa humour in adverts such as Lindsay Smithers' highly successful &quot;Yebo gogo&quot; Vodacom advert which makes a laughing stock of an arrogant and ignorant white bagel; Bosman Johnson's &quot;amagluglug&quot; ad and the Hunt Lascaris Nando's ads that make fun of South African foibles, like &quot; Chicks rule OK?&quot; for Women's Day last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, Walsh argues that global adverts prove that the &quot;universal approach&quot; is possible, but that it is more the exception than the rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi managing director William Leach espouses a &quot;universal&quot; approach to advertising concepts, saying that, &quot;great ideas transcend the boundaries of race, culture and age&quot;. He cites Coke adverts and the award- winning British Airways Face commercial run in 159 countries, in which people come together to form a face and then a globe followed by a British Airways logo flashing across the screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leach maintains the universal model is generally applicable. Using simple visuals and messages, and an emotive approach, is the key to successful adverts, he says. The concepts of Eurocentric and Afrocentric in adspeak are old-fashioned, and using different adspeak for black and white consumers is patronising, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leach discounts the relevance of race and culture in the advertising equation. The youth market from Soweto to Sandton have more aspirations in common than not, he says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The many attempts at creating printed Yellow Pages or the equivalent of telephone directories for the Internet have never quite come off, largely because, by the time such books are printed, the Internet has grown by 50% since they were compiled, and their users are missing out on the bigger, better and newer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this second of a four-part Web Feet series on getting the most out of the Web, we look at the only logical way to outline Internet resources: on the Internet itself, where your directory can be updated as the information arrives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not surprising, then, that so many directory services have emerged on the Internet, most following in the wake of Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com/), the granddaddy of them all, now valued at several hundred million dollars on Wall Street.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The great benefit of Yahoo, as with many of its second fiddles, is that its huge database of Web sites, each with a capsule summary of the site, can be searched without going through a Webwide search engine. In other words, you're not getting every last document containing your keyword, only the specific registered web sites that contain it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personally, I believe Yahoo's biggest competitor is Infoseek (http://www.  infoseek.com/), which offers both a directory in the Yahoo tradition and a search engine that goes trawling through the Web.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this search engine has a neat feature that few others seem to have twigged, despite its obvious need: once you've done a search on, say, &quot; Mandela&quot;, and come up with a search report of 8000 documents, you can then search only within those 8000 for documents that also contain the words &quot;Pope John Paul&quot;, and from the subsequent 102 documents ask for only those that also contain the words &quot;FW de Klerk&quot;, and you end up with no more than 15 documents from which to commence your manual search. More about such search issues next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yellow Pages type services do make it onto the Internet, specifically the online version of that giant yellow tome that tends to arrive in South Africa a year after it is already useless, New Riders' Official World Wide Web Yellow Pages (http://www. mcp.com/newriders/wwwyp/index.html). Online, however, it is fully updated, searchable, and explorable via several hundred categories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Argus Clearinghouse (http:// www.clearinghouse.net/) has nothing to do with old newspaper hacks, but rather describes itself as &quot;The premier Internet research library&quot;, and evolved from the Clearinghouse for Subject- Oriented Internet Resource Guides. It offers the usual categories, from arts to science.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - What do you do when there are two radio stations with substantially the same format, both wanting a slice of the airwaves?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will it be overkill for listeners and too much competition for advertisers?  Or should the discipline of the free market be left to sort out who will and who won't survive?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the questions facing the Independent Broadcasting Authority after a hearing held in Johannesburg this week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing, Africa On Air - a consortium which manages Highveld Stereo - raised strong objections to Solid Gold obtaining a broadcast licence, one of three for sale for the FM frequencies 99.2FM, 95.9FM and 102.7FM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa on Air, which includes Primedia and a conglomeration of union investment companies including the powerful Mineworkers Investment Company, recently paid R320-million for Highveld Stereo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa on Air director Nomhle Gcabashe questioned Solid Gold's commitment to empowerment, despite its association with the South African National Civics Organisation (Sanco).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solid Gold's lawyer, Mark Rosin, replied that Sanco, which now has 20% of the station's shares, has an option to acquire an extra 40% over the next four years, which would give it 60%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Solid Gold gets the licence, it will pay only an application fee of R30000 plus start-up costs of around R1-million. This is because it will be purchasing a new waveband, instead of buying an already existing station</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The point of buying an existing station for such a large fee is that you buy years and years of listenership identity and goodwill associated with a particular waveband,&quot; said one observer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sum of R3-million, which Sanco was to raise as a loan for Solid Gold and which was a point of criticism, had been waived, said Rosin, adding that the station would now get that funding from banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Solid Gold has pre-sold advertising in excess of about R8-million, so they are commercially viable from the moment they go on air,&quot; Rosin said after the hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the time at the Carlton Hotel conference room was spent discussing the definition and parameters of &quot;adult contemporary radio&quot;, with Africa On Air asserting it included music from the early 1960s to the present time, aimed at the 25 to 49-year age group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There would, however, be no heavy metal or hard rock,&quot; said Paul Ward, an American expert brought in by Africa On Air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concern was that Solid Gold's format was exactly the same as Highveld's, said Gcabashe, who drew considerable laughter when she later added: &quot;We sit before you not because of any fear of competition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reply, Solid Gold said there were, in fact, differences in format, in that over 50% of their music repertoire would be pre-1972, while &quot;adult contemporary&quot; encompasses all hit material from the last 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) councillors, John Matisonn, commented it was interesting to note how often people not in the market demanded a free market, but once they got a licence they developed &quot;a great appreciation&quot; for regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nine applicants have put forward proposals for the three new frequencies being offered by the IBA. They are Virgin, Jazz FM, Classic FM, Solid Gold, Khaya, Win FM, Youth FM, Radio P4 and Radio Cidade. Radio P4 is a Norwegian consortium involving former Robben Island prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA is due to make its ruling on the three new wavebands at the end of this month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Debate rages about the role the media should take in reporting the truth commission, writes Claudia Braude</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The run-up to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission conducting hearings on the role played by the media during the apartheid years, the debate surrounding the press playing a reconciliatory role raged among journalists at a workshop held in Cape Town last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop organised by the Media Peace Centre - a non-profit organisation which established itself independently after the phasing out of the National Peace Secretariat - examined the media's coverage of the commission and its hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Print, radio and TV journalists, truth commissioners, cartoonists, writers, psychologists and academics discussed their work which ranged from reporting and illustrating the commission in the press to live broadcasts and in-depth television documentaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The TRC depends on the media to communicate its message to the nation,&quot; says commissioner Denzil Potgieter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the only way of involving the nation in healing and reconciliation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC KwaZulu-Natal general manager, Khaba Mkhize, agrees that the media should foster reconciliation but Jane Taylor, the workshop facilitator and an academic from the University of the Western Cape, argues that the &quot; repositioning the media as an agent of reconciliation&quot; requires distance from a tradition of strong opposition which governed local media history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRC radio journalist and poet Antjie Samuel disagrees with the notion that journalists should indulge themselves in a reconciliatory role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must get the truth out and let people decide,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The work of the media, including building the new South Africa by reflecting its complexity, could conflict with the commission's statutory obligations, says one journalist while another argues that the media needs to be free to criticise the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few whites, however, are believed to be watching Max du Preez's TRC Special Report. &quot;They don't want to deal with the truth,&quot; says Jacques Pauw whose documentary on Eugene de Kock, Prime Evil, nevertheless attracted a large white viewership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While researching in the corporation's archives, Pauw found a 1987 interview featuring live footage of an Askari shot at Vlakplaas. &quot;They (certain SABC journalists) denied its existence, but it's clear that some SABC journalists had access to Vlakplaas as early as 1987,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Du Preez's Special Report attracts one million (mostly black) viewers, and scores the highest audience rating for a current affairs programme, it is under financial threat and has been cut by a third. &quot;There's no money from government. Nobody is funding the programme,&quot; says Pauw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government funding promised for coverage of the truth commission has not materialised, confirms another corporation radio journalist. Cut-backs has included the recent scrapping of the outside broadcast points, and victims' and perpetrators' own voices no longer appear on news bulletins. SABC Radio's truth commission team could also face disbanding, says SABC radio journalist Kenneth Makatees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of complaints by radio listeners who objected to hearing truth commission-related stories, commision stories are also sometimes now slotted into &quot;weird&quot; times, like after 8pm when most of the farmers are no longer listening, says Makatees who believes this is subtle censorship. Clive Emden, of the Freedom of Expression Institute, said the public interest was being subverted by the old guard within the SABC's establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A communique' on the financial cut-backs was drafted for submission to the SABC's board. A monthly meeting between the truth commission and the media was also planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists are still being 'gagged'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Managing the package&quot; is how truth commissioner Hugh Lewin describes selecting 12 statements from 150 submitted for public hearings in one community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Which is the story to choose, the story we say you should hear?&quot; he asks.  He's upfront about the process, difficulties and discomfort involved in narrating the role of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants at the Media Peace workshop articulated other challenges and limitations involved in the telling. Some obstacles, like the SABC's financial cut-backs and subtle censorships could be solved while other hurdles (such as destroyed archival material) will be of critical and popular concern for many years. Either way, the public requires insight into how the biggest and most important story in South Africa's media history is produced.  If reconciliation comes with truth, illuminating the way the truth is told is crucial to building a critical and self-critical nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the implications for a post-apartheid understanding of the past, of the corporation's radio journalist Sophie Makoena's difficulty in finding adequate background material in the corporation's archives? Or of the quiet but powerful censorship encountered by radio journalists Antjie Samuel and Kenneth Makatees whose report of torture, involving the slamming of a detainee's penis in a drawer, was pulled by a corporation hard-copy writer who refused, in the name of Christianity, to allow the word &quot;penis&quot; on air?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mokeona's and Samuel/Makatees's incidents indicate continuity between the corporation's past as a propaganda tool of the apartheid regime and the new, democratic public broadcaster - what the corporation's general manager for KwaZulu-Natal, Khaba Mkhize, calls &quot;reporting driven by the baggage of the past&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the mechanisms for putting an end to news production motivated, intentionally or otherwise, by an apartheid mindset?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question arose at the workshop as to how the commission will deal with editors and journalists proven to have collaborated with the apartheid regime.  Whether they should continue to influence public opinion needs to be publicly debated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the question of intimidation which still exists at the SABC should be examined, especially when journalists and producers are being gagged across- the-board. Or hauled across the coals in disciplinary hearings after speaking to the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop was largely aimed at assisting reporters to understand the difficulties they face as well as debating the shortcomings of the truth commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The 1997 South African consumer market is divided, not by race, but by levels of sophistication and income. Viewership patterns in the wake of the relaunch of SABC television serve to emphasise the change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This development fulfils a prediction by agency head Reg Lascaris and researcher Nick Green in the book Third World Destiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any race-based marketer still talking about the emerging black market will be surprised to learn that it has already emerged,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He/she missed it because consumers are no longer identifiable in terms of pigmentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sophisticated, well-educated and well-remunerated black television viewers have different preferences to low-income black families with little education.  Shared pigmentation has little relevance to viewing preferences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Significant differences in viewing habits emerge when the preferences of A- income group black adults are compared to programme popularity among all black adults (the old black market). For example: the music programme Ezimtoti scored 18,7 Audience Ratings (ARs) among black adults and only 13,9 ARs among high-income black adults. The music show Jam Alley scores 18 ARs among black adults and 13,4 ARs among high-income earners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to television dramas, black adults enjoy the SABC's Harts of the West (12,4 ARs) but the A-income group laps it up in a big way with a rating of 17,8 ARs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even among shows with low ratings, there can be big differences between two groups of viewers who happen to be of the same pigmentation. The television drama Courthouse got a rating of 2,4 ARs among black adults and a 1,8 AR rating among high-income black audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Popular American sitcoms and family shows outscore programming which one would assume had a guaranteed language-based viewership. For example, The Cosby Show and Family Matters generate higher ratings than the Sesotho News, Xhosa News or Tswana News.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A founding editor of the Mail &amp; Guardian, Anton Harber, is leaving the newspaper for radio, writes an M &amp;G Reporter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANTON HARBER, founding editor with Irwin Manoim of The Weekly Mail, and sole editor for the last two years of the Mail &amp; Guardian, announced this week that after 12 years he was leaving the newspaper to take up the position of chief executive of the New Radio Consortium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like a father whose child is about to leave home,&quot; he confessed after surprising the M&amp;G staff with his decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting in his office on Monday, the wall behind him plastered with front pages conjuring up the battlefields of the past - &quot;Detainees link SAP men to Renamo&quot; ... &quot;We're Back on the Streets&quot; ... &quot;Exposed: Police Cash for Inkatha&quot; - Harber struggled to explain his decision. &quot;Editors have a shelf life,&quot; he said wistfully. &quot;I became editor at such a young age ... I've had the nicest job in South Africa's print media.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in 1985, at the age of 26, that Harber, Manoim and a small group of friends and colleagues dug into their pockets and started a newspaper of their own. Harber and Manoim were co-editors for 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harber became sole editor two years ago when The Guardian newspaper group in London purchased 72% of the publication. The Guardian preferred the newspaper to have one editor. Manoim moved over to become editor of the daily electronic version of the M&amp;G.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harber had always been the more vocal of the two, the one who spoke out in public debate and on television (most memorably on one programme when he called then-minister of law and order Adriaan Vlok a liar in front of millions of viewers).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Radio Consortium owns Radio Oranje and East Coast Radio. The two radio stations combined have a daily average listenership of close to 340 000. They are estimated to be worth at least R60-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was an emotionally difficult decision, but a natural step forward for me. I have always seen myself as a bit of an entrepreneur. I believe that it is my greatest skill,&quot; Harber said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As chief executive of the consortium, Harber will not be involved in the day-to-day running of the radio stations, but instead in the &quot;overall strategic operation and long-term view the stations will take&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a move toward a more managerial style of operating but not one, he said, that will require a suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never believed that the success of my ventures ever depended on my having to wear a suit,&quot; he said, looking down at faded black Levis 501, striped shirt and Doc Martens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Radio Consortium has applied for a broadcast Medium Wave licence in Gauteng. The proposed radio station would focus on news and information, catering for a market of young black professionals, currently neglected by existing radio stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 1980 graduate of the University of the Witwatersrand, Harber went straight into journalism. He did short stints on the Springs Advertiser, the Sunday Post and the Sowetan before joining the Rand Daily Mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Rand Daily Mail and Sunday Express were folded in 1985, Manoim and Harber initiated the idea of an independent newspaper. Manoim, assistant editor of the Sunday Express, had experience in both reporting and sub- editing. He played a key part in producing and setting up several alternative publications as well as designing mainstream newspapers. Harber, a political reporter at the Rand Daily Mail, had a vision and energy that made up for his lack of experience outside the Rand Daily Mail's political department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manoim recalled how Harber burst into the Sunday Express offices, midway through the speech of then-editor Ken Owen informing staffers that the publication was to be closed. On a different floor, the staff of the Rand Daily Mail staff were also getting the bad news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ranting and raving,&quot; as Manoim put it, Harber declared that &quot;something has to be done&quot;. Manoim thought he would be the perfect partner for a new venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harber and Manoim and friends and colleagues worked out the details. The Weekly Mail was launched on June 14 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harber went on to become one of the country's most highly regarded editors.  There are some in journalism who would argue that Harber has been lucky. &quot; Being in the right place at the right time has been good to him,&quot; one colleague said - adding that Harber has also, on occasion, been at the right place at the wrong time. The Weekly Mail's daring landed Harber and the paper in court on many occasions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Day deputy editor Alan Fine this week lauded both Manoim and Harber for putting together a publication which made a &quot;big mark in the industry&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Sunday Times editor Ken Owen, who was The Weekly Mail's first subscriber, said that Manoim and Harber &quot;succeeded in what can be termed as an extraordinary achievement&quot;. Owen acknowledged that he did not regard Harber as a friend as much as a colleague, one he regarded as &quot;intelligent&quot; with &quot;reserves of energy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The combination of Irwin and Anton made a formidable team and they took the chance and achieved a lot. They were right and I was wrong,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as Harber takes his first steps into broadcasting, he said it will be difficult for him to separate entirely from the M&amp;G. &quot;I will have to fight to resist the temptation to peer over the shoulder of a new editor,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will continue as an editorial director at the paper. &quot;I will no longer have the joy of being directly involved in the newspaper. Instead, I will be able to be active in the overall strategy of the company,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But still he did not sound convinced. His desk was cluttered with faxes, letters of complaint, letters of praise, bits and pieces of paper calling out for attention. There are administrative details to attend to and the interview is interrupted by Harber's secretary Maxine Rautenbach. Checking and double-checking appointments, he concedes that he is exhausted and still has so much work to do. He seems frazzled. &quot;I realise that the baby has now grown and it's time to move on,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will fill his shoes as editor? Speculation has been rife and several names have been bandied about, including in-house staffers and outsiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harber says it is unfair to divulge exactly who the contenders are; the process is confidential. But he expanded on the qualities he believes the editor should harbour: &quot;I believe that the person should have a vision and should understand and appreciate where the newspaper has come from during the Eighties ... the struggle it has endured - and translate that into a fresh vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new editor should have a great deal of courage as he or she will have to endure stresses and pressures from a variety of areas, including government. Also, he or she will face the tough challenge of good journalism in a complex and fluid society,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next editor, says Harber, will come under pressure from government officials, as will all editors in the Nineties, to sacrifice critical independent reporting for a false sense that holding back such articles will be for the overall good of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harber is reluctant to put a time-frame on how long before the new editor takes up the reins but says he will be &quot;phasing out over a period of months&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His new offices will no longer be in Braamfontein, which ironically still manages to capture a bit of the vibrant and some say seedy CBD, holding somewhat on to The Weekly Mail of the past. Harber will be moving north to set up the New Radio Consortium's HQ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the end of an era - some say of solid teamwork and loyalty at the M&amp;G, which sustained it for more than a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harber argues that this is not the end but the beginning ... one which &quot;is challenging and vibrant for journalists. It is very hard emotionally to leave but the paper will emerge stronger. It has a strong foundation,&quot; he says, &quot; because of the people and the ethos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harber will also be stepping down as chair of the Conference of Editors (COE) and he will relinquish his role in trying to unite the COE and the Black Editors Forum under an umbrella body called the South African National Editors Forum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Cutting wages is not an effective means to increasing employment, write Eddie Webster and Ian Macun</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONTRARY to conventional wisdom the South African labour market is reasonably flexible. This is the conclusion reached by the South African Labour Flexibility Survey, conducted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Sociology of Work Unit of Wits University and presented at a conference hosted last week by the Department of Labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey raises a puzzle: if the labour market is as inflexible as is popularly believed, why are employers able to recruit on the external labour market with so few restrictions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enterprises in certain sectors are free to employ temporary labour (either on contract or part-time), pay at lower rates and provide less benefits. More than 80% of the firms surveyed had employed temporary and/or casual employees over the past two years, suggesting a very high degree of labour market flexibility indeed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take another result: very few enterprises apply for exemptions from industrial councils (only 12%) and of these, the majority were larger companies - employing more than 151 workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These findings have important policy implications. Many African countries have implemented policies designed to reduce wages and achieve a flexible labour market. But recent research by the ILO shows that despite the reduction in wage and non-wage costs during the 1980s and 1990s, employment has not increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers conclude that labour costs and a deregulated labour market are less important than labour productivity. This is crucial to ensuring successful integration into the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour costs in and of themselves mean very little. What counts is productivity. Low labour costs do not guarantee it. Labour in Europe is expensive, but it is highly productive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ILO Country Review cites comparatively poor labour productivity standards in South Africa, according to the ILO's Guy Standing, John Sender and John Weeks in Restructuring the Labour Market: The South African Challenge. But, it says, the problem is often attributable to outdated management and organisational structures, not necessarily high wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the report's recommendations is reduced working hours and increased shift work. The significance of this recommendation is that enterprises can respond to the productivity challenge in different ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation of work is not fixed. Research can redefine our options in the workplace and it can help clarify how best to reshape our labour market institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This leads to a second point. A useful distinction, suggests Tony Killick of the University of Sussex and author of The Flexible Economy, can be made between responsive (or passive) and innovative (or active) flexibility.  Innovative flexibility refers to the creation of new institutions that help to give the economy a competitive edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, we believe, is an example of an innovative response to flexibility. The creation of the National Economic Development and Labour Council is one example; the Council for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration is another; the ILO Review's proposal for multi-stakeholder regional development accords -called Redacs - is another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the creation of new institutions is a protracted process. Institutional history moves slowly. This does not mean that policies do not matter. What it does mean is that the path whereby the present has been reached influences the nature of the present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what way does our past shape the present? We would argue it does so in very obvious ways. The most significant example of the persistence of the past is what Naledi researcher Karl von Holdt calls the &quot;apartheid workplace regime&quot;. This is characterised by racial inequality, adverserialism, a low investment in the skills of black workers, and, above all, a non- identification by black workers with the goals of the enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These realities are confirmed by the survey findings; African workers continue to be concentrated at the lower end of the job structure and occupy very small shares of technical and managerial positions; 42% of all establishments surveyed have experienced some form of industrial action during the past 12 months. While many establishments reported that they provide some training, only a minority provide formal training involving classroom learning, apprenticeship or attendance at courses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In firms characterised by such low levels of incentives, and where most unionised workers are in jobs with a low discretionary content, they are unlikely to adopt a longer-term concern for the performance of the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the core then of the legacy of the past lies a low trust relationship between employer and employee. The building of trust is quite central to the new labour regime. And co-operation itself breeds trust. Trust improves efficiency. It is what James Coleman, professor of sociology at the University of Chicago, calls a form of social capital. Like other forms of capital, physical capital in the form of machines and human capital in the forms of skills, social capital is productive, making possible the achievement of certain ends that would not be attainable otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absence of social capital is self reinforcing. For example, in the survey we found little information transfer from management to workers. A lack of communication between employers and employees leads to distrust, shirking, and disorder, which intensify one another in a vicious circle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we cannot wait for social capital to emerge. We can start creating it now by enhancing institutional capacity and rewarding those enterprises that are moving towards this goal. One way of doing this is through what Guy Standing and Avril Joffe called a Human Development Enterprise Index. The index scores firms on the basis of certain key indicators gained from the survey and is aimed at encouraging firms to develop good employment practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another way would be to enhance the capacity of unions at the enterprise level, by providing additional resources, particularly union-approved education. Interestingly, the survey found that unionised firms have a greater propensity for introducing incentives and organisational change. Of the firms reporting to be offering monetary and/or, non-monetary incentive schemes, 84% had a recognised union. Importantly, more managers expressed their satisfaction with labour efficiency in unionised than in non-unionised firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, policies aimed at encouraging incentives are more likely to lead to productivity-enhancing behaviour in firms than policies aimed at simply reducing costs. Support for institutions, such as trade unions, is another prerequisite for greater equity and efficiency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - With the local industry under pressure, South African mining houses are expanding further into Africa, reports Lynda Loxton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH AFRICAN mining houses continue their march into Africa as local mines become more marginal and costs continue escalating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several speakers this week told the second annual Investing in Mining Conference that local mining companies were increasingly taking their expertise to neighbouring countries, many of which remained under-explored, with minimal development of their vast and diverse mineral and metal deposits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Fleming Martin Securities mining research director Dennis Tucker, major South African mining companies could be investing up to $100- million in Africa this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, according to one of those companies, the benefits for Africa could be considerable. Randgold Resources has improved productivity at Mali's Syama mine by 25% in the past month and expects to be able to extend its life beyond the currently projected nine years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Managing director Mark Bristow said that the prospects for Syama were exciting. &quot;Having managed the operation for four months now, we are happy that our due diligence identified all the critical issues, none of which is unsolvable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will take some time and money to realise the full benefit of the re- engineering process. However, I have confidence that the plan in place will result in the optimum exploitation of the ore body.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randgold Resources acquired management control and 65% of the share capital of Syama gold mine in Mali as part of its acquisition of BHP Mali Inc last October. The mine had been dogged by poor technical decisions and tensions between management and workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the past month we have seen up to a 25% improvement in mining productivity which can be attributed to the improvement in drill and blast practices, an increase in bench heights and changed operating shifts from two 12-hour shifts to three eight-hour shifts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This accords with our South African experience, which tended to show that poor results are more frequently the result of poor management than poor and unproductive labour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Randgold took over the mine, says Bristow, &quot;industrial relations could not have been any worse&quot;. Now the mine has recognised worker representatives and reached agreement on a new shift roster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have also made good progress on negotiations towards a mine-based labour agreement, which addresses a comprehensive training strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Randgold had acquired extensive mineral interests in west, central and east Africa. Tucker said Randgold Resources had budgeted $15- million for exploration, most of which was destined for east and west Africa, particularly Mali, Burkina Faso and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglo American would spend about $45-million in Africa in 1996/97 compared with $100,000 in 1991. Most of this would be for grass-roots expenditure with about two- thirds concentrated in gold. About 80 geotechnicians and 600 support staff were involved in exploration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JCI is actively pursuing Lega Dembi in Ethiopia and has the Prestea mine in Ghana, where a &quot;decent resource both underground and on the surface is in the process of being delineated&quot;, Tucker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Net exploration expenditure in 1996 was $13-million &quot;and this is expected to double in 1997&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gencor was most active in Ghana, Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso while activities were likely to grow in Zambia and Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gencor's exploration budget of $43-million in 1997 should see around 30% spent in Africa,&quot; Tucker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GFSA had mainly concentrated on Ghana, where it controlled the Tarkwa underground mine, which produced about 50,000 ounces a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tucker said these examples showed that &quot;South African mining houses are not obsessed with deep-level, hard-rock mining at home nor are they bound to operating in any specific country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the main reasons why South African mining companies were looking north included shrinking margins, tougher operating conditions and a host of potentially deadly threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The glorious days of announcing a new gold mining discovery (in South Africa) every other year have long gone,&quot; Tucker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, lower grades were being mined and volumes squeezed as mining activity moved deeper and further away from existing and often old infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Management has tried to take corrective action to halt the decline in gold production but employee productivity &quot;has failed to move off its low base&quot;, Tucker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year's depreciation of the rand increased mine revenues by 25%, but this was almost wiped out by an average increase in production costs of about 20%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly a margin squeeze is in the making yet again,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other problem areas included suggestions that mines should be made to amortise capital spending. If this happened &quot;then the deep-level gold mining industry in South Africa is already history&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Health and Safety Act would also make managing a deep-level mine &quot; very difficult&quot;, he says, while a range of new labour regulations could put further pressure on costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were already under pressure because of the need to mine &quot;deeper by the day&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last year's wage increase of some 2% above the ruling inflation rate sets the scene for an interesting wage battle this year, with inflation on the increase,&quot; Tucker said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Business is moving - to Cape Town. To establish just how many companies are setting up shop in the Western Cape, and why, Wesgro, the parastatal established in 1986 to promote investment in the region, this week called for a detailed analysis of the trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wesgro urban and regional planner Rae Wolpe told the Mail &amp; Guardian it would be vital for the economy of the province to establish the exact number of businesses relocating.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would also be important to gauge the reasons for the recent spate of relocations, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Wolpe: &quot;It is quite obviously an increasing trend for businesses of various natures to relocate to the city and we are busy looking into the possibility of doing a thorough research into this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We recently held a workshop with investors where various issues related to the economic future of the province were discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we found is that investor interest in the province is huge and originates from all corners of South Africa as well as internationally,&quot; said Wolpe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, keen investor interest in secondary towns outside Cape Town was noted during the workshop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Towns like Stellenbosch, Paarl and Worcester seems to be particularly attractive for investors because of their rural atmosphere and close proximity to Cape Town,&quot; said Wolpe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investment consultant Theo Aspeling agrees that Stellenbosch and Paarl will attract &quot;an avalanche&quot; of investments in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warns, however, that this would need to be controlled and that a study of business relocation to the Western Cape and an analysis of the nature of future investor interest was necessary to curb this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Pam Golding Estates managing director Andrew Golding, &quot;the increase in interest from the business sector has led to an increase in demand for residential properties&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, he said, stimulated both property markets, in turn boosting the price indices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adds Ronald Ennick of Pam Golding: &quot;Prices in Cape Town for both residential and office property in similar areas are between 20 and 30% higher than in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are keen to move to the Cape for a number of reasons, including business relocation and the perception that it is a safe environment to raise a family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are experiencing a monthly increase of 16% in the number of properties sold to people from Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we expect that interest in properties in Johannesburg will increase towards the end of the year when bargains become available,&quot; said Ennick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Rawson Estates' managing director Bill Rawson said inquiries for business properties came from all the major centres in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is now an established fact that the major migration of businesses is to the Cape, but it will be difficult to establish the exact numbers relocating.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - We cannot afford to react to the market clamour by lifting exchange controls too quickly, writes Madeleine Wackernagel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WITH the recent strengthening of the rand, the issue of lifting exchange controls is once again on the table. Every time the market rumours gain volume, the Reserve Bank rapidly quashes them; this time was no different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Cross, the new deputy governor, denies that the bank has brought forward its timetable for relaxing controls. &quot;The process,&quot; he told the Mail &amp; Guardian, &quot;needs to be managed carefully. We need to get to a situation where all the elements are in place and the decision, in effect, is taken for us, as with the abolition of the financial rand. Then it becomes a fait accompli and the opportunity for destabilisation is minimised.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We certainly haven't reached that stage yet - neither the fundamentals nor sentiment is strong enough to deter massive capital flight. Which begs the question - why lift exchange controls at all, at least in the near future?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overriding rationale seems to be political (as was the original motivation for implementing controls), a desire to integrate South Africa into the global economy, boosting foreign confidence in the country's status as a fully functioning player on the world stage. In effect, abolishing controls would signal that South Africa has grown up, and firmly put its paranoid past behind it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would also set us apart from the rest of Africa, which doesn't have the best reputation for liberal economic policy and, consequently, is not a favourite haven for foreign funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, depending on one's political viewpoint, another plus is less government control over the economy - as Britain discovered to its cost in 1992 when the pound was driven out of the European exchange-rate mechanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But numerous successful economies still maintain controls, despite these perceived advantages. Indeed, when Korea's economy was taking off in the 1980s, controls were kept firmly in place. Recent moves to liberalise capital flows have resulted in a rapid de-industrialisation process, with investment flowing to the Philippines and Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says James Heintz of the National Labour and Economic Development Institute: &quot;With capital controls, it becomes more costly for money to move out of a country in search of a quick return, so it is more efficient to re-invest inside that country. What's happened in Korea is very destabilising for the society as a whole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exchange controls, he says, are a very useful tool for intervention - in any economy. With complete freedom, capital tends to be drawn to speculative, capital-gains type of investment, rather than adding value through production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heintz believes South Africa has a long way to go before it is ready and able to relax controls. &quot;All the pieces of the puzzle must be in place before we can do anything. Only once all aspects of the economic reforms being undertaken are up and running, such as job creation and housing delivery, and we can honestly give the country an A plus on its report card, should we consider changing the rules.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He points to the market panic in December last year, which resulted in another hike in interest rates, as evidence. &quot;Adjusting for inflation, South Africa's interest rates are among the highest in the world right now - and that's with exchange controls. What would happen if they were lifted? We'd see a massive devaluation in the rand as capital left the country and even higher interest rates as a result. Not to mention the knock-on effects in terms of prices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government and the Reserve Bank have made their intentions clear. A &quot; big bang&quot; approach is out but gradualism is in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Pieter Laubscher of the Bureau for Economic Research in Stellenbosch: &quot; An exchange-control 'big bang' is not possible without a macro-economic policy 'big bang'. As Chris Stals (governor of the Reserve Bank) said recently, the painful short-term adjustments that will have to accompany a 'big-bang' approach could prove to be too much, placing the other components of the process of macro-economic restructuring in jeopardy and possibly leading to the reintroduction of capital controls at a later stage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, waiting too long also has its downside. The market will expect a sharp depreciation in the currency in the event of controls being abolished, and consequently, engineer it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that threat has dissipated for the moment, continued depreciation increases the probability of exchange controls being lifted, as they will be seen as the prime obstacle to the successful implementation of the government's growth, employment and redistribution plan (Gear).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markets have a habit of getting their own way, witness the Mexican debacle in 1994/95. But in the South African scenario, common sense will hopefully prevail, giving the economy the breathing space to get the fundamentals right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opinion is divided on how soon that might happen, but expectations are high that further relaxation will take effect this year. Says Laubscher: &quot;The prospects for a more stable domestic financial environment this year have improved and we expect more announcements on exchange controls soon, possibly before next month's Budget. While such moves could postpone the chance of a drop in interest rates, they shouldn't have excessive effects on the economy and markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the experience since the abolition of the financial rand has shown us, financial volatility is a new reality in South Africa. It will be countered only to the extent that the authorities implement credible, stable, transparent and consistent macro-economic policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Dollar on the agenda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* THE issue of the strong dollar is expected to dominate the twice yearly meeting of central bankers and finance ministers from the world's seven wealthiest nations tomorrow. While some Japanese officials worry about inflation if the dollar continues its climb, the rest of the Group of Seven - the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Britain and Italy - appear happy with its recent rebound from the post-war lows of 1995. Economists don't expect the G7 meeting to try to push the dollar one way or the other.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wall St takes a knock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* TECHNOLOGY shares led a sharp sell-off midweek even after the Federal Reserve board left its key lending rates unchanged, soothing investor worries about rising inflation or interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 86,58 points to close at 6,746.90. The technology-laden Nasdaq market posted the biggest losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stronger bonds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* BONDS were stronger on Thursday as investors sought to push the yield on the R150 bond down to the 15% strike level, dealers said. In early trade the benchmark long government bond - the R150 - was four points stronger at 15,03% . The rand was last at R4,4735 against the dollar from Wednesday's close of R4,4870. &quot;There is a big push to pull the rate down to the big number. If we break that then we could see 14,90% briefly as people cover. The stronger rand and foreign buying is helping that move,&quot; one dealer said. Gold has still not regained its glister, closing at $342.60 an ounce in London midweek, down from $345.90 late on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US giants merge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* TWO Wall Street titans - Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter, Discover and Co - have agreed to merge in a $9,9-billion deal that will create the world's largest securities firm. The merger is being driven by strategic concerns and complementary strengths. Dean Witter, Discover and Co is strong in &quot;retail'' brokerage, selling stocks, bonds and such to the public. Morgan Stanley specialises in mergers and underwriting securities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - After the sharp deterioration in October/November, the business confidence index for December/January showed a recovery of one percentage point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason, says the South African Chamber of Business (Sacob), which compiles the index, is partly a turnaround in sentiment, thanks to the stronger rand, the prospect of a cut in interest rates, and expectations of a soft landing for the economy this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sacob also cited the renewed commitment by the government to its growth, employment and redistribution (Gear) strategy as a contributory factor, but called on the government to &quot;harness the political will to set the economy on the growth high road as set out in Gear&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Sacob acknowledges the potential political difficulties in implementing the strategy, it is adament that &quot;1997 presents a window of opportunity during which the Gear strategy must get off the ground and some of the less palatable aspects of the strategy need to be tackled. These include accelerated tariff reform, labour market flexibility and privatisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sacob is also optimistic on the chances for an interest-rate cut, thanks to a drop in credit demand, but issues a cautionary note: &quot;With inflation at around 9%, there is little motivation to borrow funds at 18% - since any funded project would need to make 27% to break even. As the marginal projects are shelved because of the prevailing inflation rate/interest rate conditions, fewer job opportunities are generated ... with the economy slowing down on the one hand and interest rates relatively high on the other, small and medium-sized business is especially vulnerable to higher insolvencies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The employers' organisation is also concerned at the magnitude and persistence of the current account deficit - R10-billion in 1996 - but sees hope for narrowing the trade gap this year, in line with the rand's depreciation. The world economy should continue to perform well, leaving room for South Africa to expand its exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Non-gold exports should receive a boost this year, with various export finance guarantee schemes coming on line,&quot; says Sacob. &quot;Niche opportunities, especially in minerals beneficiation, are still available for exploitation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Central Energy Fund (CEF), which holds the state's fuel assets, has quietly limped into the new South Africa with the appointment of a new, far more representative board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new players on a board that until recently was synonymous with the CEF's sanctions-busting past, include what chairman Roy Pithey describes as a fair cross-section of academic, private and state sectors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His new board includes black empowerment guru Don Mkhwanazi, Kayo Ngqula of Norwich Union Trust, Mojalefa Ralekhetho and Johan Basson of the Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs, black empowerment Coca-Cola bottler Keith Kunene, Professor Renosi Mokate of Pretoria University, andCoen Kruger of the Department of Finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CEF repeatedly pushed for a new board during the reign of former mineral and energy affairs minister Pik Botha. It and Botha failed, despite the efforts of parliamentary committee chairman Marcel Golding. The changes are one of the more obvious achievements of Penuell Maduna, who took over from Botha last year, giving the portfolio more political clout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maduna has chosen to appoint the same board for all of the CEF group of companies, which includes Mossgas and the Strategic Fuel Fund, oil trader and manager of South Africa's strategic stockpile. Insiders say this could signal Maduna's intention to rationalise the group, perhaps preparing parts of it for a sell-off.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As SAA limbers up for an equity partner there are increasing signs that morale and standards are slipping. Mungo Soggot and Max Gebhardt report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZUKILE Nomvete grudgingly tells the story of how he was saved by rival Sun Air shortly after he assumed his Transnet post of executive director in charge of South African Airlines (SAA). Twenty minutes before his SAA flight to Cape Town was due to take off, the check-in counter informed him it was too late - even if he was who he said he was. So he rushed to the Sun Air counter, which graciously put him on a flight that left five minutes later.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete, one of Transnet's squad of R850 000-a-year executive directors, is not flattering of the airline he has inherited. He concedes its management and staff are sheltered and, at times, arrogant - particularly when considering whether they need the help of a foreign airline to run the business. This attitude perhaps explains why it is rival Comair that now sports the British Airways logo in a partnership that has flustered the national carrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government, it seems, is more realistic. Ketso Gordhan, director general of transport, says: &quot;The government task team that recommended the partial privatisation of SAA in 1995 also recommended that capital, technology and management skills be brought in. It is vital that the transformation of SAA, which has been very sheltered, be given external impetus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of Nomvete's senior staff put the blame on him when explaining falling standards, such as the increasing incidence of cabin crews failing to pitch up for flights. They say his intervention in day-to-day management has been disruptive and question his qualifications for the job. Nomvete's track record in aviation has in fact included a stint as a flight engineer for Ethopian Airways, a post he was later ironically rejected for at SAA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has an irrepressible enthusiasm for the airline industry. In the midst of discussing airlines' aircraft buying habits he veers off into an exploration of America's domestic market. &quot;The United States domestic market is a beast of its own. It behaves in its own particular fashion. It has its own momentum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some staff members were unimpressed by Nomvete's performace on a recent countrywide tour with SAA boss Mike Myburgh during which the two executives sought to lift the airline's spirits with glossy presentations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete admits morale at the airline is shaky - a situation exacerbated by tensions between the old and new guard at a once closeted state enterprise that has been exposed to significant competitive forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the affable executive director, who is also in charge of Transnet's sprawling property empire, is not entirely downbeat about the airline. Later on in the conversation he says morale is slowly starting to pick up and talks excitedly about plans to relaunch the airline with a new image. And he insists much of its troubles stem from the high cost of fuel and the weak rand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leon Els, the airline's representative, adds a &quot;lower passenger turnout&quot; to the list of &quot;external factors&quot; that has hit SAA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the dire state of SAA's finances, Nomvete still finds time for a personal touch with SAA's customers. The previous day he had flown to Guguletu, Cape Town, to visit the little girl who was recently savaged by an SAA toilet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete's jocular approach to life is certainly a change from the dour style of management to which SAA employees have become accustomed. On a recent trip to London he apparently caused a stir - among first-class passengers and check-in staff alike - by joking that he had a couple of AK- 47s in his luggage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete, along with the rest of SAA's front men, does not want to talk about its looming partial privatisation in any detail. He will say, however, that SBC Warburg should finish assessing how much SAA is actually worth in the next few months. He says this will be crucial for the forthcoming sale. &quot; We must look at the process of evaluation of SAA so we can then have an idea of a value of the particular entity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to look 10 years down the runway and guess whether SAA, which has shed several international flights, will be an international or just an African carrier, he says: &quot;Scenario planning in the aviation field is a dicey one.&quot; But he hints: &quot;Our strength is not whether you can fly the intercontinental routes but will depend on the strength of our domestic feeder network ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Els, meanwhile, dismissed suggestions that tensions between old and new guard employees were materially affecting the running of the airline. He said SAA started an affirmative action programme six years ago that had filtered through to all its areas of operations. Asked why SAA was so concerned about the Comair/BA deal, he said he was worried about the precedent this would set for other airlines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - A delegation of American religious and civil and human rights leaders, headed by former Martin Luther King chief of staff Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, National Council of Churches General Secretary Rev. Joan Campbell and American Committee On Africa Executive Director Jennifer Davis met at The White House today with National Security Council Adviser Samuel Berger to discuss United States policy toward the Nigerian military dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation also met with senior officials of the Mobil Oil Company, a major U.S. investor in that oil-rich African nation. Rev. Tyrone Pitts, General Secretary of the 2-million-member Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc. and Bishop Felton May of the United Methodist Church completed the delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group presented Mr. Berger with the Declaration of Conscience On Nigeria, calling for the immediate restoration of human rights and democracy, signed by 70 religious leaders from across the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Campbell, representing 51 million American Christians affiliated to the NCC, presented Mr. Berger with a copy of a special World Council of Churches report on oppression in the Nigerian oil fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation described their meeting with Mr. Berger, President Clinton's top foreign policy adviser as friendly and open, and a useful dialogue on the continuing crisis in Nigeria, Africa's most populous state and the largest U.  S. trading partner in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our objective,&quot; said ACOA Executive Director Jennifer Davis, &quot;was to share with the White House the growing public concern about the brutality of the Nigerian military regime and the urgent need of the United States to use its economic influence to support democracy.&quot; The United States buys nearly half of Nigeria's annual oil output, generating billions of dollars for the military dictatorship. &quot;The delegation urged the administration to impose sanctions to support democracy,&quot; said Davis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation also met with senior officials of the Mobil Oil company, which currently produces 500,000 barrels of oil a day in Nigeria. The leadership delegation, joined by South African pastor Mangedwa Nyathi, raised specific concerns about Mobil's business ties to the regime and its links to the security forces. Mobil produces over 100 million barrels of oil a year for the Nigerian government and pays the salaries of armed Nigerian security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We appreciate that Mobil is in business to make money,&quot; said Rev. Walker, who also serves as ACOA President. &quot;But we reminded the company that slavery too was profitable. We must never accept that profits are more important that human life. At some point someone must bite the bullet and do what is required for freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation was sponsored by The American Committee On Africa, which played a leading role in the campaign for sanctions against apartheid South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Tens of thousands of refugees yesterday fled the Shabunda camp in eastern Zaire after reports that ADFL rebels had captured the nearby town of Katshungu, some 45 km to the northeast. According to UNHCR, some 40,000 Rwandans packed up their belongings and were thought to be heading west in the direction of Kalima and Kindu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UN-chartered plane was expected to overfly the area today to try and locate the refugees. A small UNHCR plane bringing in blankets and food was surrounded by about 150 people demanding to be flown out and police twice fired into the air to disperse the crowd.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR, which has been the only agency working in Shabunda since late December, said the mass exodus occurred a day after four days' worth of food had been distributed. A food warehouse and hospital in Shabunda were looted, allegedly by local people, as the refugees were leaving. About 7,000 Zaireans were also reported to have fled Shabunda. The town reportedly fell to ADFL rebels at 17:00 yesterday, two and half hours after the final evacuation of humanitarian workers. WFP announced that a joint WFP-UNHCR mission was on its way to Kindu to meet the local governor and attempt to determine the exact location of the fleeing refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unconfirmed report from humanitarian sources in the area reported that Punia had also fallen around 15:00 yesterday. Punia was the site of four refugee transit sites sheltering refugees fleeing from fighting in the east towards Lubutu, 130 km further north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small groups of refugees are said to be leaving Amisi camp, but as yet there has been no indication of a mass departure from the camps of Tingi- Tingi and Amisi, despite reports that the rebels are closing in on the area.  WFP said that a 3-4 day food distribution to these refugees started on 31 January and ended yesterday. WFP yesterday yesterday welcomed a decision of the Zairean government to allow the use of foreign-registered aircraft to deliver food within the area, and the granting of permission to resume flights from stockpiles in the region to Kisangani. According to unconfirmed reports, two aid agencies working in Amisi were turned back or pulled out of Amisi today due to insecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* This latest development in eastern Zaire's refugee situation comes ahead of UNHCR chief Sadako Ogata's visit to the Great Lakes region today. Ogata, who will spend 10 days in the region, told Reuters on Tuesday that the world had lost interest in the plight of the remaining refugees. After the mass exodus at the end of last year, the international community &quot;breathed a collective sigh of relief&quot;, she said. Pointing out that UNHCR's work in eastern Zaire was not easy, she expressed the need for international support.  &quot;But I don't see very active international support. All this time, the world has lost interest in these refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* As the rebel advance appeared to be gaining momentum, Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko held talks in Rabat with King Hassan of Morocco late yesterday. No details of the discussions were immediately available, but Mobutu is widely thought to be requesting military aid from the Moroccan government to help put down the rebellion. In 1977, Morocco helped Zaire quell an uprising in Shaba province, then known as Katanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Condemnations of the murder of five UN human rights monitors in southwest Rwanda began flowing in, amid discussions by aid officials in Kigali on how best to handle the increasingly precarious security situation. The Rwandan government, which blames Hutu insurgents for the killings, expressed disgust over &quot;the action of these thugs&quot;. Vice-presidential adviser Claude Dusaidi claimed the attack had been targeted against government ministers who were in the area on a sensitization mission. The government has launched a campaign to try and reconcile Hutu returnees with their Tutsi neighbours. Dusaidi urged the UN not to suspend operations in the unstable western areas of the country. &quot;What the United Nations should do to assist in finding these people and controlling them, is to give us more funds and more help. We need this for security purposes - radios, communications and fighting equipment,&quot; he said. &quot;It would mean we could have more gendarmes, more communal police and be in more places.&quot; He warned of further attacks. &quot;These people are criminals.  I do think they will come back and it could happen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France paid tribute to all those working to restore peace in Rwanda and said it &quot;strongly condemned&quot; the upsurge in violence, while the American ambassador in Kigali expressed regret that &quot;terrorist violence&quot; had claimed the lives of more humanitarian workers. &quot;We deplore this senseless act, which appears to be designed to draw Rwanda further into a circle of violence,&quot; he said, according to Rwandan radio. He added that the USA remained committed to working with the government and people of Rwanda to bring about peace and reconciliation. Few details have emerged about the killings, which occurred two days ago when gunmen opened fire on two UN vehicles transporting the observers in Karengera commune, Cyangugu. The UN is holding an investigation, as are the local authorities in Cyangugu prefecture, according to Rwandan radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the insecurity, aid agencies began scaling down their operations in Rwanda. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies announced it was relocating most of its delegates from Kigali. Twenty-five staff members would leave for Nairobi in the next two days, the Federation said in a press release issued yesterday. A skeleton staff of six delegates would remain in Kigali until operations could be resumed. Following the government limitations on using NGOs to monitor and distribute food in the communes, the Federation was already in the process of scaling down its emergency operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international aid group Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) told AFP it has also pulled its expatriate workers out of two western Rwandan provinces, Cyangugu and Kibuye. &quot;The programs are continuing, as far as possible, with local staff,&quot; said Alex Parisel, an MSF official in Kigali. MSF will be meeting in Brussels on Thursday to decide on their future course of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Who remembers Max Perkins? But I'll bet you remember Hemingway, Fitzgerald and the host of other American writers he painstakingly nurtured until they achieved fame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perkins is one of the forgotten people of the literary world, as most good editors are. Most sectors have these people, individuals whose role it is to facilitate, whose work is all about making other people shine. No society can flourish without them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Science is no exception. The face associated with a Nobel prize is the individual on top of a pyramid of others - technicians, administrators, support staff, family and friends - who contributed to that scientific breakthrough. In an area where funding and professionalism is so crucial, there are also the bureaucrats in government, whose decisions may have vital consequences for researchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enter Rob Adam, a man not quite comfortable in a suit, former resident of Pretoria Central Prison, whose vision is all about building a society where science and technology can function in a vibrant and constructive way. He is the deputy director general of the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, and is responsible for the science and technology work of the department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*It would be easy for an outsider to overlook him, despite his great height, at a departmental function, for example, where he avoids the limelight. Even in an interview, he keeps his personality in the background, his talk being all about the issues and developments in the sci-tech sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all that - or maybe because of that - he has influence and the respect of his peers. &quot;Rob is so honest,&quot; says one council head. &quot;It's unusual in government. I hope he never changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others describe him as fair, approachable and a man of great personal integrity. But Adam himself does not see any of these qualities as unusual.  For him, it is behaviour that makes sense. He argues that if you explain to people why you are making certain decisions, they are more likely to understand your position, even if they are unhappy about the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pragmatism is fundamental to the choices he makes. So, although he spent nine years in jail and many months in solitary confinement because someone shopped him, he has never tried to find out who that was or how it happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you go down that route, it's very hard to let go of it,&quot; he says. &quot; You've got to let go. It's like a bad relationship - if you hang on and try to analyse it, you just make it worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when he talks about prison, he presents that time as a set of interesting experiences: eight months in solitary confinement, where you grow to miss your interrogators because at least they provide some stimulation; a year with the criminals, who found him something of a novelty; some time getting to know the Italians of a right-wing fascist movement, also incarcerated; and, finally, the years with the small group of politicals with whom he spun plans of how they would run the country when they came to power - including what kind of science and technology sector South Africa should have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We never thought it would happen in the time frame it did, but we believed that one day, things would change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even without cold stone jug, the story of Adam's life is a bit of a smorgasbord. First there was the growing up in mining towns - his father was a metallurgist - followed by a sojourn at Bishops, a prestigious private school in Cape Town; a degree in chemistry at the University of Cape Town; and then self-imposed exile in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I left South Africa thinking I wouldn't come back again: I couldn't find a place or a way for myself here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London was a revelation, a place where ideas flourished and people collected together to discuss politics, issues, places. He gravitated to the South African and Namibian issues, and that brought him into contact with the African National Congress, which recruited him. &quot;What the ANC did for me was give me a way to go home again, in a way that I found acceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He describes the work he did for the ANC, euphemistically, as reconnaissance, and makes it sound like just a project, like the kind of thing he does every day. He doesn't see what he does now as particularly different, but as an outgrowth of his background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People wonder why I'm in this department,&quot; he says. One of his former colleagues from Pretoria Central said to him recently: &quot;I would never have expected you to be a civil servant.&quot; But he says his job combines the two areas he has always been involved in: science and politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the question of losing out on a Nobel prize? Adam has a PhD in theoretical nuclear physics and was awarded a prestigious international post- doctoral fellowship to do research in Amsterdam. He could have taken up a career in science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's assuming I would be an award-winning physicist,&quot; he says. &quot;The Nobel prize is certainly beyond most people's reach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also the problem of his age - the years in prison meant that he was older than the average physicist when he began to look at an academic career. He says in physics, you need to achieve particular goals by a certain age. Besides, &quot;physics is a contracting business, particularly theoretical physics. In physics, you can't stop and smell the roses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam has a young - and growing - family: his wife, Liz, a fellow scientist; a three-year-old daughter, whom he describes as &quot;a skilled negotiator and manipulator&quot;; and a son, born this week. They have a home in Pretoria that looks on to Meintjieskop in a quiet area. He'd like to enjoy all this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he says he would still like to do some work in physics, write a few papers. He feels it will keep him in touch with the scientists he has to deal with. &quot;Also because it keeps my brain working,&quot; he says, &quot;and at the end of the day, I'm more useful to myself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps that's the key to Rob Adam's character - not a man who serves simply so that he can be useful to others, but because in that work, he finds he is useful to himself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Aids deaths drop in NY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* AIDS-RELATED deaths have declined dramatically in New York city. The journal ScienceNOW reports that deaths from Aids have declined by 30% from 1995 to 1996 - from 7 000 to 5 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total cases began to plateau in 1991, but mortality rates only began to drop at the beginning of last year. Researchers say the drop could be attributed to patients having easier access to drugs to treat opportunistic infections. Others say the introduction of new drugs called protease inhibitors early last year could also be a factor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spam in a can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* THE three Apollo I astronauts who died in a launch-pad fire 30 years ago were remembered last week at the first public ceremony held in decades. The families, friends and former colleagues of Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom, Edward White II and Roger Chaffee, who died inside their burning capsule on January 27 1967, gathered in front of the asronauts' memorial at Kennedy Space Centre.  Over the years, Nasa has all but ignored the anniversaries of the Apollo I fire, while observing - just one day later, on January 28 - the anniversary of the explosion of space shuttle Challenger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deathly splendour</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* ARCHEOLOGISTS have completed the renovation of a tomb of an ancient Egyptian priest, who decided to be buried like a pharoah despite his lowly origins. Old Kingdom priest Kai lies west of the Giza pyramids and his tomb is decorated with detailed inscriptions in bright colours, telling his rags- to-riches story and showing his love for his first wife. Egyptian archeologists took almost three years to restore the limestone chapel of the tomb, discovered in 1993 buried beneath sand and rubble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quantum leap for lasers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* AMERICAN physicists have created a laser that has a beam of atoms rather than a beam of light, and could be used for etching tiny electrical circuits and for improvements in super-accurate atomic clocks. Researchers report in the journal Science that the laser works by trapping a cloud of atoms between magnetic fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How the earth moves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* GEOPHYSICISTS at Johns Hopkins University in the United States have developed a model that may explain recent suggestions that Earth's solid inner core rotates faster than the rest of the planet. The model shows this &quot; super-rotation&quot; of the inner core could be caused by electromagnetic forces and the fluid motions of an outer, liquid core.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outer core is composed primarily of liquid iron, while the inner core is a ball of solid iron measuring 2 440km across. Researchers recently inferred the &quot;super-rotation&quot; of the earth from past data of seismic waves.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - HOW does menthol get into menthol cigarettes? - Charlene, Benoni</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THOSE of you who have suffered head colds or sore throats will be familiar with the mountain-fresh rush of menthol that brings instant relief. In fact, the menthol that is used by the food and pharmaceutical industry is the same as that used to create the just-brushed taste of menthol cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warren Cuyler, product manager of the German-based company Haarman and Reimer (one of the world's largest menthol producers), explains that menthol is an organic compound found in oil of peppermint, extracted from mint plants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he declines to give details (one of those closely guarded &quot;trade secrets&quot;), he describes the process of creating synthetic menthol as &quot; complicated&quot;, involving forms of extraction and distillation. The result: &quot;A synthetically produced menthol that is controlled and produced for 100% consistency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This &quot;scientific&quot; menthol is sent to tobacco companies in a &quot;crystal pellet form&quot;, similar to household sugar. According to Shamina Rajcoomar and Glen Ah Sing of the United Tobacco Company, this synthetically produced menthol accounts for 30% of the total amount used - the other 70% is &quot;natural&quot; menthol obtained from India and China in a similar crystal form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobacco goes through an elaborate process to become cigarettes. Before being sent to the factory, the three types - Burley, Virginia and Oriental tobacco - are cured, using different methods. The tobacco bales are graded according to &quot;the chemical differences in nicotine and sugar&quot;. Upon arrival at the factory, the bales are &quot;conditioned to a specific moisture content&quot;, and cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the flavouring is added. In the case of menthol, there are two methods used. In the first, the menthol is added as a top-dressing, &quot;by dissolving the menthol in ethanol (a type of alcohol - the same one found in beers and wine) and spraying it on to the cut tobacco&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alternatively, the menthol &quot;is melted at 45 C, and rolled on to the foil or cigarette paper&quot;, resulting in the flavour distributing itself evenly throughout the pack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tobacco is now ready to be put together inside cigarette papers, with filters and &quot;plugwrap&quot; (the paper around the filter), to form cigarettes. The United Tobacco Company uses fully automated, computer-controlled machines that produce 8 000 cigarettes a minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much like wine-tasting, tobacco companies employ &quot;an official smoking panel&quot; to check the various flavoured cigarettes (&quot;Texan&quot; cigarettes, for example, are flavoured with rum). According to Rajcoomar and Ah Sing, &quot;the compounding of the finished total flavour is regarded as an art&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just to blow your mind with statistics, the Nielsen Wholesale Index, which measures the total cigarette market in South Africa, says menthol cigarettes account for 3,6 % of the total market share - equal to 964-million cigarettes a year. The total number of cigarettes produced yearly is just short of a staggering 26,8-billion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Real stars take drugs, lose their looks and throw tantrums.  But 'Digital Hollywood' can now make its own stars, writes Pat Kane</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCI-FI writer William Gibson, the inventor of the term &quot;cyberspace&quot;, recently brought out a new novel about a digital woman - a computer-generated image - who gains an actual consciousness and wants to merge with a human admirer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibson appropriated the Japanese word for idol, Idoru, to name his digital heroine. That, you might think, is science fiction. But not so fast. Down in the silicon trenches of what they're calling Digital Hollywood, cyber- evangelist Scott Billups wants to create the first autonomous virtual idol.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, he makes his living by computer-scanning the bodies of live Hollywood stars ... and dead ones. Lurking within his apartment are two of the biggest potential idora of all: Virtual Marilyn and Virtual Marlon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The actual Marlon Brando was down at my house the other day,&quot; says Billups, the chirpy man who made the dinosaurs move in Jurassic Park. His long-term project has been to create a convincing version of Marilyn Monroe - &quot; musculature, expressions, movements, everything. We've researched everything, studied all the images, talked to her friends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, it seems, is why Brando was visiting. &quot;They were lovers, after all,&quot; says Billups. &quot;If anyone would think we'd got a virtual Marilyn right, it would be Brando.&quot; And was he convinced? &quot;He watched for a long time, turned to me and said, 'Bill, you've got her. That's Marilyn all right.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brando has prior connections to this alchemist: Billups digitally scanned Brando's face for an hour-long television documentary on his life, where the old star interviews a virtual version of his younger self. Billups admires Brando for his candour: &quot;He's the only one of the Hollywood stars whose digital impression I've taken who's been prepared to go public about it. All the rest are nervous as hell that any of this gets out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secret they're hiding is what could be called the digitisation of stardom. When a performer's characteristic expressions, gestures or postures can be turned into a scatter of pixels, a Pandora's box of potential problems opens up. In the realm of the &quot;synthespian&quot; - the technical term for the virtual actor - Hollywood has never been weirder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, Billups was called in by a production company a few months ago, to solve a rather thorny problem. &quot;What happened was that Rutger Hauer had fallen into a cactus while shooting on location in a desert, and quite badly injured himself,&quot; Billups recalls. &quot;The producers had to get the movie finished, or the company would be screaming. So they asked me to scan Rutger and finish the rest of his movie sequences virtually - which we did.&quot; Pause. &quot; Film insurance companies love what I do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Boudry, whose London-based Computer Film Company has won two Oscars for technical innovation, says his most bizarre digital repair job was in Mission: Impossible: &quot;There was a scene where Tom Cruise was eating at a table, and a dribble of spit came down his chin. We just took it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boudry has also removed spots from cheeks and adjusted hairlines downwards.  So is all this just a branch of the make-up industry? &quot;Sometimes, yes. But in five years' time, you will be getting virtual actors. Technically, it's an inevitability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What might also make it inevitable are the escalating costs of movie-making.  Insurance companies so love what people like Boudry and Billups are doing that in the future they may insist stars have themselves digitally scanned - in case sudden death, illness or even &quot;bad attitude&quot; makes it impossible for them to finish a movie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has occasioned another star-versus-studio tussle. &quot;I've been told a number of heavy-hitting stars are asking for limits on the presence of digital images in their movies,&quot; says Joseph Beard, a law professor in New York. &quot;The law is unclear here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another force favouring the synthespian is the pulling power of the classic movie idol. Remember the Forrest Gump sequences with JFK and Herbert Hoover?  This was effectively digital cut-and-paste: taking existing footage and mingling it with new action. But what's coming is something Variety magazine recently dubbed &quot;digital grave-robbing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce Lee is being raised from the dead. The estate of George Burns has allowed a producer to create a digital composite of the deceased comedian for a new movie. If this works, the possible combinations are rich and endless: Hugh Grant and David Niven? Geena Davis and Katharine Hepburn? Marilyn ...  and Marlon?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virtual inventors are already in between the lines of Gibson's Idoru, building screen creatures from scratch and hoping these will one day talk back to their creators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the rest of us may feel the same shiver that the data researcher Laney does in Gibson's book, gazing upon a hologram of Rei Toei, the synthespian idol: &quot;Don't look at the idoru's face. She is not flesh; she is information.  She is the tip of an iceberg, an Antarctica, of information.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - What is reconciliation? Who does it benefit? Antjie Krog probes differing views on the concept</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE was Tom and there was John. Tom lived opposite John. One day, Tom stole John's bicycle and every day John saw Tom cycling to school on his bicycle. A year later, Tom walked up to John. He stretched out his hand. &quot; Let's reconcile and put the past behind us.&quot; John looked at Tom's hand. &quot;And what about the bicycle?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said Tom, &quot;I'm not talking about the bicycle.  I'm talking about reconciliation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This story was told by Father Mxolisi Mpambani during a panel discussion on reconciliation at the University of Cape Town organised jointly by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and UCT's department of African Studies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dirk Coetzee turns to the family in the front row. &quot;I ask your forgiveness.  I am sorry for what I did ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal representative of Charity Kondile reads her statement to Coetzee: &quot;You said that you would like to meet Mrs Kondile and look her in the eye.  She asked me to tell you that she feels it is an honour ... you do not deserve. If you are really sorry, you would stand trial for the deeds you did ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A long uncomfortable silence fills the hall. The judges, the legal representatives, the audience ... everybody looks distraught - the only movement is the Adam's apple of Dirk Coetzee as he swallows slowly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview afterwards, Kondile says: &quot;It is easy for (Nelson) Mandela and (Desmond) Tutu to forgive ... they lead vindicated lives. In my life nothing, not a single thing, has changed since my son was burnt by barbarians ... nothing. Therefore I cannot forgive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notable was the way the story was presented in the press. Coetzee asks forgiveness (&quot;white&quot; press); Kondile refuses to forgive (&quot;black&quot; press). The latter with a definite tone of pride in the refusal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the word &quot;reconciliation&quot; is most often used by Afrikaner politicians.  Although one would think they use it to hide their fear that they alone will be held responsible for the country's shameful past, they mostly prefer to use &quot;reconciliation&quot; as a threat: give us what we want, or we won't reconcile with a black government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dictionary definitions of reconciliation have an underlayer of restoration: of re-establishing things, returning them to their original state. The Oxford says: &quot;to make friendly after estrangement; make resigned; harmonise; make compatible - able to co-exist&quot;. The Afrikaans dictionary says: &quot;weer tot vriendskap bring; accept; not resist&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutu's reconciliation theology ties in with this classical definition of reconciliation. Academics say reconciliation has formed an integral part of his theological thinking since 1979. But Tutu has &quot;Africanised&quot; the concept of reconciliation so that it shows up the usual Western Christian motive for reconciling as sometimes being too far removed to be of value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church says: &quot;You must forgive, because God has forgiven you for killing his son.&quot; Tutu says: &quot;You can only be human in a human society. If you live with hate and revenge, you dehumanise not only yourself, but your community. You must forgive to make your community whole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet it is interesting to see the contrast with the views of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, on reconciliation and forgiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last year, the University of Natal presented Mbeki with an honorary doctorate at the its &quot;Reconciliation Graduation Ceremony&quot;. Initially Mbeki seemed a somewhat odd choice to honour for reconciliation - a theme he seldom publicly dwells on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also seemed - after the motivation and the Mbeki curriculum vitae were presented - that the university itself was not familiar with possible reconciliatory actions its honoured candidate might have undertaken. The mere bestowing of an honorary degree on an African National Congress leader by a former &quot;English liberal institution&quot; was perhaps the University of Natal's version of reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one mentioned the major personal role Mkebi has played in the recent peace achievements in that violent and revenge-racked province. ANC sources say that Mbeki spent weeks and weeks in the province, consulting and paving the way for reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the ceremony, Mbeki's speech was distributed to the media. But instead of the reconciliation speech, Mbeki took out a totally different set of notes about his European visit, never delivering his reconciliation speech.  The distributed speech contains three illuminating paragraphs. Where reconciliation for Tutu is the beginning of a transformative process, for Mbeki reconciliation comes after total transformation has taken place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Real reconciliation cannot be achieved without a thorough transformation and democratisation process,&quot; says Mbeki. And, later:&quot;True reconciliation can only take place if we succeed in our objective of social transformation.  Reconciliation and transformation should be viewed as an interdependent part of one unique process of building a new society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki is clear on what he regards as transformation. He quotes Chief Albert Luthuli: &quot;There remains before us the building of a new land ... a synthesis of the rich cultural strains which we have inherited ... It will not necessarily be all black, but it will be African.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is there a contradiction between what Mbeki and what Tutu are saying? Tutu believes black people have access to an almost superior humanity, which enables them to do that which surpasses cold material logic. When a woman at the truth commission hearings said she forgave the killers of her son, Tutu told her: &quot;You make me so proud, mama, to be a black person like you.&quot; What the world lacks, black people have. The main thrust of his reconciliation is between people of all colours - the rainbow image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki, on the other hand, doesn't necessarily care what the world lacks. He spelt it out in Durban. He wants Africans to work together to transform the country and the continent. He talks about an African renaissance. He wants to show the world that African people can run a country and a continent successfully. For him reconciliation should take place among Africans to make transformation possible. And whether Mbeki means black when he says African is unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the views at the UCT panel discussion varied between these two positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Pamela Reynolds from the anthropology department underscored Tutu's vision that, in a wonderful way, people are already busy forgiving and reconciling. The fact that no revenge attacks take place means that people in their everyday lives have already weighed up the costs of reconciliation and revenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Abner Mofokeng, reconciliation walks hand in hand with survival. As the human resources manager at Southern Life, his analysis is practical: &quot;The South African experience has taught us that reconciled co-existence is essential for survival. Personal survival is inextricably linked to the survival of others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reconciliation for Nozipho January Bardill will only take place the day whites also feel offended by racism, instead of feeling sorry for blacks. (To &quot;feel sorry for blacks&quot; has become the ultimate crime - committed by those called, in the newspeak, bleeding-heart liberals.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shirley Gunn brought the audience back to some basic questions. Who should reconcile? Who will gain what from reconciliation? Who will be the beneficiaries? She ties it in with delivery and echoes the words of Charity Kondile. It is easy for Mandela to forgive - his life has changed; but for the woman in the shack, it is not possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mofokeng confronted Gunn: &quot;It is simply not true that Mandela is not conscious of the woman in the shack. But Mandela keeps the bigger purpose, the fuller picture, in mind and because of that, in the end her children or grandchildren will benefit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A professor from America conjured up an unexpected picture of reconciliation. &quot;True reconciliation in America was visible when we saw on television how whites and blacks together looted a furniture shop ... you cannot carry furniture alone and they simply worked together in self-interest.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the back of the audience a young, tall student got up and addressed the issue carefully skirted during the lunch-hour panel discussion: &quot;I would like to say something about the issue of racism now surrounding the commissioners themselves. If there is one thing that irritates me, it is when the new black elite whines about racism - while in actual fact, all they want is the power and the positions of the whites so that they could exercise those very same values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone avoided everyone else's eyes. Professor Mahmood Mamdani from Uganda - currently in the AC Jordan professorship at UCT - was asked to conclude the discussion. &quot;Five years ago, if someone mentioned to me a new democracy and a genocide, I am not sure I would have fitted South Africa and Rwanda in the correct slots,&quot;he said. &quot;What I still ask myself is whether it is not easier to live with perpetrators than with beneficiaries?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamdani says that in Rwanda there are a lot of perpetrators and few people who benefited: in South Africa there are few perpetrators, but lots and lots of beneficiaries. And should reconciliation take place between victims and perpetrators, or between victims and beneficiaries?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamdani warns that there could be resentment if the majority, who expected to gain from reconciliation, is excluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reviewing the book by Kader Asmal et al, Reconciliation Through Truth, Mamdani elaborates: &quot;It becomes a problem when the history of resistance is seen as synonymous with the history of the ANC ... then apartheid becomes reduced to a terror machine and resistance to the armed struggle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamdani uses the 1992 whites-only referendum as an example of how complex the issue of resistance is. It was regarded by a lot of South Africans as nothing more than a moment of narrow self-interest. Mamdani says it was a milestone, a shift signifying an historic moment of the first white settler minority on this continent reaching out for a settlement with the majority - &quot; Without this moment any talk of reconciliation would have been wishful thinking,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamdani asks whether the basis for reconciliation after the Anglo-Boer War was not redistribution to Afrikaners rather than punishment of the English: &quot; Were the English and Afrikaners partners in a common crime (apartheid) against humanity or was apartheid a programme for massive redistribution, reparation, of today's loot in favour of yesterday's victims?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This upsetting analogy leads to the question of whether the truth commission is then the equivalent of the symbolic Ossewa Trek of 1938 - a tool to create a particular nationalism and not a new South African identity?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story goes that Alan Paton participated in the symbolic trek because he believed that it was the beginning of an authentic new South Africanism - after listening to the speeches at the laying of the foundation stone of the Voortrekker monument, Paton went back home, shaved off his boer beard and said: there was no space there for me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mamdani's analysis perhaps makes space for both the seemingly contradictory reconciliation views of Tutu and Mbeki. Mamdani says durable reconciliation will only be built if its basis straddles both race and ethnicity. Race was meant to be the identity of the privileged, ethnicity the identity of the oppressed; race was urban, ethnicity rural.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if Tutu deals with racial reconciliation and Mbeki with ethnic reconciliation, they can complement each other. And if some evil is embraced, may it be the lesser of the two - the bicycle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Dear Walter, HEAVENS knows why the world has to choose Switzerland for an economic summit. Engage a local banker in a discussion on financial matters and they go an awful beetroot red and start shouting that their close personal relationship with Herr Eichmann was purely business and the use they have made of the late Mrs Cohen's life savings is a commercial secret which they are honour-bound to keep in the interests of their client.  No wonder the cuckoo is the national emblem.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I write to tell you of a nightmare I had last night. It was more in the way of what Parks calls a &quot;bio-pic&quot;, starting in time-honoured fashion with the birth of the central character. It quickly became apparent that the child had been born to the warrior tradition, from the engaging way he bashed his nursemaids over the head with a toy knobkierie. As an adolescent he spent much of his time - between bouts of bashing his childhood friends over the head - fantasising about the day he would be emperor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After many adventures as a clerk in the Department of Native Administration, involving a female overseer with a peg-leg and prominent moustache, he became a chief -- a mantle which sat uneasily on his shoulders, being a status which fell well short of emperor. For a while he worked off his frustration by frightening local newspaper editors into calling him &quot;lord&quot; and delivering speeches of what he considered to be suitably imperial length.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it happened, there was a local king in the neighbourhood. Our chief latched on to this unfortunate personage, proclaiming himself - despite the said monarch's shrill protests - his personal adviser. In this capacity he pronounced himself a prince, which took him at least part of the way down his career path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile turbulent events were taking place in the land involving a power struggle between a neighbouring tribe and an occupying power. With great cunning our prince involved himself in this conflict, secretly allying himself with the occupiers - with whose help he built up a well-equipped army - while publicly identifying himself with the struggle of his neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbours won, but, nervous of the prince's well-equipped army, invited him to help them rule the country in the hope it would satisfy his imperial yearnings. This the prince agreed to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now it so happened that the new leader of the country was an elderly man who had not had much of an opportunity in his youth to enjoy the good things of life. He had, however, long dreamed of owning a cuckoo clock. Hearing of a distant land which abounded in these noisy devices, he determined to pop off for the weekend and secure himself one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On an impulse of good-neighbourliness, he offered the prince the opportunity to rule the country in his place. The prince agreed with an alacrity which was lost in the mutual back-slapping and guffaws about the difficulties of re-writing the Constitution on a Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in this far-off land the old man dreamed a dr...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know, Walter, on re-reading this I think I had better hurry on home.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The high drama of former superspy Craig Williamson's appearance in the Pretoria Supreme Court this week was deflated by a pitiful divorce case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before Williamson's case came up before Deputy Judge President Piet van der Walt, a man sporting a wavy hairstyle uncannily similar to that of former Civil Co-operation Bureau operative Ferdi Barnard took the stand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson, his small army of security guards and the rest of the court looked on as a stocky, disenchanted husband, clad in a blue crimplene suit and pink shirt, explained why he wanted to untie the knot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his wife had tried to shoot him, had had an affair, had attacked him, and had consistently failed to find work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge van der Walt granted him a divorce and swiftly moved on from the violence of marriage to the violence of the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mostly they will become long-term investors, buying blue-chip shares which they intend to hold, as the lawyers say, &quot;for keeps&quot;. Of course they will trade their shares to a limited extent; all public companies have their ups and downs, and wise is the investor who gets out of one at the top and into another somewhere near the bottom. This, too, is part and parcel of protecting the value of one's savings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the problem is this is never a purely defensive strategy. The canny investor who protects his savings by selling under-performing shares and buying something better will invariably not merely break even, but make a profit. And this is when the South African Revenue service gets interested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The principle has always been that the long-term investor is not taxed on the profits of his share-dealings. They are considered to be his capital and the profit is therefore not taxable income. The problem arises when a person buys and sells too many shares in a particular period; then he risks being labelled a trader who makes his income from shrewd selling and buying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question came squarely before the Appellate Division last year in a case concerning a Mr Nussbaum from Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nussbaum was a retired school teacher. In 1945, he had inherited some shares and thenceforth became an archetypal middle-class investor, lived within his means and ploughed the surplus back into the stock market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the early 1980s he changed tactics. Because of a very high inflation rate, the money market offered unusually high interest returns. Nussbaum testified that his governing principle was to maximise his annual return on his investments. For this reason, he sold a great many of his shares and bought others with better dividend returns, and invested the rest in the money market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Judge Howie remarked, &quot;One is struck forcibly by the scale and frequency of (his) share transactions.&quot; He also noted: &quot;The sales were almost without exception profitable. Indeed, (his) annual profits substantially exceeded his annual dividends income.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question that decided the case boiled down to this: what was Nussbaum's purpose in the share transactions? If it was simply the realisation of capital assets, he was free from the taxman's grasp. If, however, he was disposing of trading stock, he was not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This meant the court had to decide what his purpose was and, in the novel part of the decision, it decided that it could look past the main purpose of Nussbaum's transaction (which was to protect and maximise his dividend yield) and to his secondary purpose. Judge Howie found that Nussbaum had not discharged the onus of proof on him to show that he had no secondary purpose of making a profit from his share transactions, and he accordingly held that Nussbaum was liable for tax on these profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In colloquial terms, the Appellate Division decided that Nussbaum was a share-dealer and that he dealt in shares in order to realise profits from their sale and purchase. One can only feel sympathy for Nussbaum; furthermore, the court's reasoning is a chill wind that will bring no comfort to those South Africans who save money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, all small investors with &quot;managed portfolios&quot; (in other words, where their stockbroker sells their shares and buys others in order to realise an annual capital increase) ought to be aware of the potential of taxation now raised by the decision in Nussbaum's case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Border United Democratic Front (UDF) official Reverend Arnold Stofile has been accused of being involved in a plot to smuggle arms from Botswana into South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two exiles, former Border UDF president Steve Tshwete and journalist Charles Nqakula, are also alleged to have been involved in the plot.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stofile, a Presbyterian minister and theology lecturer at the University of Fort Hare, is being charged in Ciskei with terrorism and various counts of possession of arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made a brief appearance in a Mdantsane magistrate's court last Friday, and a trial date was set for March 16 in the Bisho Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the brief appearance, the charge sheet was served on Stofile and his four co-accused. Charges against a sixth person, Miranda Mguendu, were dropped.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Doctor Feelgood: JA, those were the days my friend. The ouens were gathered in the bar this week talking about the good ol' days when we were the hottest jollers in town. We were talking about raves, nogal, and the things that make them happen, like Ecstasy. Why people need to pump themselves full of chemicals when mampoer, which is made from natural ingredients, gives you a buzz till you vomit, aikona.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, of course, the conversation drifted on to Wouter Basson, PW's &quot; mandrax doctor&quot;. We reckon he was dealing in Ecstasy as part of his contribution to nation building. We heard that when the Berlin Wall came down, the home-based chemists got the ossies and wessies to be best of mates by supplying thousands of E tablets at parties. Maybe that's what Basson was up to. Maybe he was going to distribute Ecstasy in a bid to get old enemies reunited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best man didn't win:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* SIES tog, it was terrible how, after that long, painful and democratic way Wits chose a new vice-chancellor, Sam Nolutshungu let the side down by saying he was too sick to deal with toyi-toying students. But it seems their democracy rubbed off on Nolutshungu's own campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students at the University of Rochester in New York state held what they call a student audit to grade their lecturers. And guess who was bottom of their list in social studies? Good ol' Sam. Good thing he didn't start at Wits and give the students there a chance to vote on his performance. Magtig, what they would have done to Senate House!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ringside seats:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* MOENIE worry nie, South Africa is being run by a competent bunch of people who spend taxpayers' money wisely. This was confirmed this week when the circus was brought to Parliament to help train a new intake of parliamentarians. S'true, honestly, sowaar. There were acrobats and jugglers spotted earnestly showing MPs how to do their tricks. Oom Krisjan's spy in the halls of power couldn't say whether there were any clowns present, so that's why we think the country's in good hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Higher English:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* THE last word goes to the man in the visdorpie who wrote a letter to a newspaper complaining about the vice-chancellor of the University of Cape Town, Mamphele Ramphele. He wrote: &quot;The article by ... Ramphele must be one of the most remarkable documents I have ever read. It was remarkable because the whole thing was almost totally unintelligible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramphele said: &quot;At a system level the managements of higher education institutions need to develop a coherent voice to engage policy questions.&quot; And: &quot;There is a real risk of disruptive forces occupying the space created by the lack of a shared vision of higher education and perceived and real weaknesses in the leadership cadre at all levels within the system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says the reader: &quot;The whole article, to my mind, reads as if it was written originally in Russian by a party comrade, translated into academic German and translated again into English by someone who doesn't really speak English.&quot; Eina.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Protests at the inadequacy of South Africa's stand against crime have become so generalised that they are no longer heard - they are reduced to the drone of the traffic in the street outside. But, at the risk of merely adding to a generalised clamour, some recent events - the theft of an 800kg automatic teller machine from police headquarters, the hijacking of a judge and the armed robbery of 50 tourists at a youth hostel - demand further comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a truism to say of our crime epidemic that it is the product of social factors, such as poverty and apartheid. But the corollary, that society must wait for the resolution of those problems before it can deal with crime, is unacceptable, however high-minded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steps are being taken, we are told. This week, to a fanfare of headlines Sydney Mufamadi, the Minister of Safety and Security, announced that police officers, including Commissioner George Fivaz, would be required to sign &quot;due performance&quot; contracts. Fivaz enthusiastically followed up with the announcement that action would be taken against officers who failed to perform &quot;up to the required standards&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The logic of this devolution of responsibility is clear ... some poor storesman is going to be blamed for everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where due performance is concerned what is to be demanded immediately of Mufamadi is an end to the ridiculous, long-standing moratorium on police recruitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument is that the South African Police Service (SAPS) has sufficient staff overall and all that is needed is a more efficient deployment of manpower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if this were true, the failure to redeploy efficiently is manifest and the country can no longer wait on SAPS managers to find the missing formula.  The apparent success of Operation Urban Strike late last year in significantly reducing the levels of crime in Johannesburg by importing about 1 000 police from other areas of the country is a pointer which cannot be ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 12 a petition signed by 20 000 citizens appealing for an end to the moratorium was delivered to Mufamadi. To date he has not responded, which is symptomatic of the apparent paralysis of government on the policing front and provides another pointer - to the need for a shake-up in political responsibility for the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were, at one stage, high hopes that the Business Against Crime initiative would produce a lobby group capable of pressuring the government into more effective action on the law and order front. But, while it would have been helpful to the force, particularly with regard to the supply of technology and expertise, indications are that it has been co-opted by the political establishment and its critical voice is no longer heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law and order tends to be regarded as the territory of conservatives, of the &quot;hang-them-high brigade&quot;. But in South Africa the crime wave needs to be seen as being of major concern to liberals, because a popular backlash poses a major threat to the values which they hold dear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is questionable, for example, how long the government can hold its line on the abolition of capital punishment if the present state of anarchy on the streets continues for long. There is already a degree of justification for a re-think on some rights guaranteed in the Constitution - notably with regard to the weaknesses of the bail system, founded in the presumption of innocence, which has seen several murderers allowed out of custody to kill again. Some might even argue that it is time to consider a wholesale suspension of civil liberties by the declaration of a State of Emergency to fight what is, unquestionably, an emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The champion of liberal ideals in Parliament is the Democratic Party, which is currently agonising over President Nelson Mandela's invitation to join the government in some unspecified role. We nurse serious reservations about its accepting the offer, the dangers of co-option being only too obvious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if it were to decide that the national interest eclipsed such considerations we would suggest that it volunteers to take over Mufamadi's portfolio. To some in the DP it might appear to be a poisoned cup, but that perception will at least counter the charge that self-interest motivates its acceptance of the president's invitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some in the African National Congress may oppose such an appointment on the grounds that, should the DP have some success in making inroads against crime, it will have handed a triumph to a political opponent. But such a boost to the fortunes of a tiny party would be a small price for the ANC to pay to rid itself of a grievous burden on its own political fortunes. And if the DP should fail the ANC would have every excuse for trumpeting: &quot;We told you so ..  .&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Koigi Wa Wamwere, Kenya's best-known opposition politician, predicts he will die in a stabbing or car crash when he returns to the country to face yet another trial, for an alleged theft of arms from a police station in November 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has served a year of a four-year jail sentence, was temporarily released on health grounds, and has an appeal pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Wamwere has never considered the option of simply not going back after medical treatment in London and Oslo. &quot;Of course that would be (President Daniel arap) Moi's wish, that I stay out, so that he could say I had broken my word.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi has other reasons for wishing that the former MP for Nakuru would disappear into the oubliette of exile politics. Wamwere may represent a greater danger to his power than any of the leaders of Kenya's half-dozen fragmented and discredited political parties. His fears for his safety are probably well-founded. Political assassinations of those who threatened the leadership have traumatised Kenya four times since independence. The killers of Pio Pinto, Tom Mboya, JM Kariuki and Robert Ouku were never brought to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wamwere, an outspoken critic of the government while a popular MP in the one-party state of the 1970s, was silenced by five years' detention without trial under Jomo Kenyatta and then Moi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1990, he was charged with treason and faced a mandatory death sentence, spending two-and-half years in prison before the charges were dropped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These days the government knows they can no longer get away with detention without trial, so this time they will attempt to kill me,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an opposition lacking strong leadership and failing to match church leaders' open concern about poverty, government corruption and ethnic cleansing, Wamwere increasingly stands out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late December, when he was released from prison and appeared in Nakuru, huge crowds turned out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The more the government keeps me out of politics, the more they heighten the myth that I'm a special person,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now shunned as too radical by opposition leaders, Wamwere will return to huge expectations among ordinary Kenyans, and a narrow margin of manoeuvre.  His goal is to press for a constitutional conference for Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's impossible to have free and fair elections when the regime has so much power; it's not reasonable to take up arms; the only prospect for change is civil disobedience in the streets to force Moi into a constitutional conference.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maputo - A couple of hundred Mozambican children filled the sandy school playground, some lounging in the shade of a shady tree, others practising their Van Damme kickboxing moves, while a small group of student volunteers from South Africa and elsewhere put the finishing touches on their rebuilt school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While one of the volunteers painted the name of the school on a new wall, &quot; Escola Primaria Umidade 2&quot; - &quot;Unity Primary School Number Two&quot; - project co- ordinator Jacob van Garderen showed what 11 students from the Southern Africa Student Volunteers (Sasvo) and a handful of locals had done over the previous two weeks in this school, nestled among thatch huts and palm trees on the outskirts of Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They put a roof over four classrooms that had been open to the elements.  They capped the blocked and unusable toilets, and dug new toilets. They put up walls where there had been none.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is school no longer has to shut down every time it rains. The 1 600 students will still have to come to the six classrooms in three shifts throughout the day, as do all primary-school students in Maputo, but now they will at least have a dry floor to sit on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been 15 years we've watched our school falling down,&quot; said Umidade headmaster, Armando Francisco Musgane, adding that in the past, efforts to find money for repairs had failed, so most classes were held outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two classrooms that were not rebuilt show what the whole school looked like two weeks before. The concrete-block structure has only three graffiti- scrawled walls and no roof, and the dirt floor looks like a well-used old campsite, with rusty beer cans, broken glass and coconut husks littered everywhere. The school has no furniture, no exercise books, no blackboards, no electricity, and no water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 85 schools in the Maputo area, and all of them are in as much need of repair as Umidade 2 was before the Sasvo project, said David Simango, Maputo's director of education. No other school reconstruction projects are currently under way in the district, although primary education is the top priority for Mozambican education officials, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years after the end of Mozambique's civil war, the country is the poorest in the world. The amount of foreign donations for reconstruction has dropped by $190-million since 1994. The International Monetary Fund, which has placed austerity measures on the country, has said it regards reconstruction funds as inflationary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a nation with a per capita gross national product of about $100, reconstruction money, including money for schools, is indispensable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the United Nations Development Programme estimated that more than one million of Mozambique's two million primary school-aged children do not attend school, noted Christof Heyns, director of Sasvo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is difficult, so difficult, to study here,&quot; said Eugenio Abel Tembe, a 19-year-old student who previously attended Umidade 2. He helped rebuild the school with the Sasvo volunteers, and the experience piqued his interest in working on more redevelopment projects. &quot;Before I did this project, there were things I couldn't do. Now, I am sure I can do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reconstruction project is one of 26 completed by Sasvo volunteers in December and January in South Africa, in Tanzania, Botswana and Mozambique, said Heyns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students volunteer their labour and expertise, and in return they get transportation and lodging while completing a project. More importantly, say these students, they contribute to the well-being of a community and gain experience in redevelopment projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such projects, however, are only &quot;a drop in the ocean,&quot; said Van Garderen, and that is evidenced by the fanfare this one project received in Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African High Commissioner for Mozambique, top education officials, monetary donors, university professors and the media all came out to see a project that lasted two weeks in total and cost about R25 000 in materials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - A powerful right-wing Christian fundamentalist group in Zimbabwe has launched a campaign against the country's modest Muslim community to halt what it believes is a &quot;dangerous and violent&quot; religion with its eyes on taking over the government on its way to blanketing the entire continent under the star-and-crescent moon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe (EFZ), a collection of several &quot;born- again&quot; churches, including the wealthy Rhema Bible Church, and which claims to have three million members in Zimbabwe, is organising boycotts of fast- food chains and chicken and beef suppliers whose products are certified halaal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also been making direct contact with senior politicians in the ruling Zanu-PF party in an attempt to counter what the group feels is a perilous new cosiness with Muslim countries like Iran and Malaysia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's anti-Islamic drive has serious implications for the country's burgeoning beef and chicken exports, and threatens jobs in the livestock industry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know the Muslims have hidden agendas,&quot; said Felix Mukonowengwe, national co-ordinator of the EFZ's halaal boycott campaign. &quot;It is to form an Islamic party, and to change the government. One day, we know, these guys will rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pamphlet, produced by the EFZ's &quot;Operation Mobilisation&quot;, urges Christians to pray for &quot;those who are ignorantly being drawn into Islam&quot;, including members of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a letter to fast-food chains Nando's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, and to the Cold Storage Company (CSC), the huge state-owned beef marketing operation, and the country's main chicken producers, the language is less conciliatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless yourselves stop supplying only halaal meat products ... we shall actively mobilise Zimbabweans to boycott your meat products,&quot; threatens the letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 20 years most Zimbabweans have been eating halaal beef. Every cow passing through the killing box at the CSC's abattoirs, after being stunned with a steel bolt rammed against the temple, has had its throat slit almost from ear to ear by a Muslim slaughterer, who utters, &quot;In the name of Allah the creator, Allah is the greatest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every couple of months, Imaam Achmat Elmie travels around the CSC's abattoirs to ensure the technique is adhered to. The method of killing is accepted as humane by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals: it ensures rapid bleeding and is common practice in non-Muslim abattoirs all over the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1976, when the CSC started selling sanctions-busting beef to the Muslim countries of West and North Africa, it asked the Council of Islamic Scholars here to certify the beef halaal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After independence, when the CSC began exporting to the European Union, every box was stamped &quot;certified halaal&quot;. In recent years, the main chicken producers followed suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in November last year, the 300 pastors at the EFZ's annual meeting took a hard look at the &quot;dangers of Islam&quot; and, particularly, at halaal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In a method similar to witchcraft, the Muslims believe that by coercing people to eat halaal food, they are submitting to Allah and to Shariah law.  In this they are becoming Muslims,&quot; says the Operation Mobilisation document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with the threat of a boycott, the CSC immediately buckled under and stopped the halaal practice at all but two of its abattoirs, hoping to be able to use the remaining two for exports to Malaysia and for the local Muslim community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearful of contamination of halaal with non-halaal carcasses and in response to the CSC's abandonment of the 20-year-old agreement, the Council of Scholars withdrew its certification, and signs went up in the mosques, warning that the CSC label was no longer a guarantee of halaal beef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CSC general manager Lawrence Masanga insists that the beef from the two abattoirs is halaal, and Malaysian High Commissioner V Yoogalingam believes the arrangement is acceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Imaam Elmie is not overseeing it and, the council points out, if it is not certifying, it doesn't know who is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nando's, which sells about 40 000 birds in Zimbabwe a month, immediately passed the buck to the chicken producers. When the boycott began, Tineyi Mawocha, Nando's managing director in Zimbabwe, said: &quot;We felt the pinch.  It's not good. I just want to maximise sales.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EFZ had less success with the chicken producers. None of the companies, nor the Poultry Producers' Association, turned up for any meetings called by the EFZ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ismail Adam, the secretary of the Harare Muslim Cultural Institute, says the community is deeply upset. &quot;All these years we have tolerated one another.  There has never been any conflict (between Christians and Muslims).&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maun - Good rains in Namibia recently have delayed plans to pipe water from the Okavango River down to Windhoek - siphoning it off before it ever reaches the unique Okavango Delta in northern Botswana - but as far as Botswana is concerned, the controversy is not over yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though everyone agrees the unexpected rainfall is welcome news, conservation groups in Botswana point out that the 250km pipeline still remains part of Namibia's master water plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a meeting of the Okavango River Basin Commission (Okacom) - formed specifically to ensure fair use of the water between Botswana, Namibia and Angola - in Windhoek last month, delegates were told dam inflows were good.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moremi Sekwale, who heads Botswana's delegation, says he wasn't surprised at the news. &quot;You underestimate the power of prayer,&quot; he laughs. &quot;We Batswana have been praying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survival of the Okavango delta relies on enough water flow, as does the tourism industry and the people who depend on the water, fish and wildlife.  Botswana's needs are particularly crucial during years of low rainfall, and for the last five years, the level of the water in the delta has been steadily dropping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the pipeline plan has been on the cards for at least 10 years, last June's decision to fast-forward the project appeared to catch the Botswana government unawares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We knew at some point that they wanted a pipeline, but we didn't expect it now,&quot; said national Director of Water Affairs B Khupe after a meeting in the capital Gaborone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental agency Conservation International (CI) was similarly taken aback. According to co-ordinator Dr Karen Ross, CI was told by Namibian water officials at a meeting in Windhoek in 1995 that the pipeline would take five to 10 years. Then in April last year, the group was told it was full steam ahead for the project because of the urgency of the drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People thought there would be ample time to study things. Now suddenly it's here, it's a reality,&quot; said Lars Ramberg, director of the Okavango Research Centre, in October. &quot;People here have every right to be concerned.  The whole region is dependent on the delta and it would be the Kalahari Desert without it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia initially said there was no time to study the pipeline's impact on its neighbours. It then agreed last December to carry out an environmental impact assessment on the delta - which it claimed it could do before March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the rains don't mean the project has been abandoned. Instead, both Ramberg and Ross say Namibia plans a bigger version of the pipeline in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Ross believes &quot;God has blessed the Okavango&quot; with the summer rains, full studies on the environmental and social impacts of the pipeline are urgently needed under Okacom. But as Okacom's study has not even started, the fear is that Namibia is still jumping the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Namibia intends to supply the long-term water demands of Windhoek forever.&quot; says Ross. &quot;The three nations of Botswana, Angola and Namibia need to sit down and agree.&quot; - Okavango Observer</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Madagascar's new president has already been ousted once. But, reports Helen Meintjes, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka is for many a devil they know</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN true Malagasy style, it's been &quot;mora mora&quot; - slowly slowly - in choosing a new president. The local maxim was coined for a palpable reason. But finally, a full three months since first voting in national elections, the &quot; red island&quot; (so named for its vivid soil) again has a president.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, scraping together a mere 50,72% of the votes, late last week sneaked an exceptionally slim victory over his only remaining competitor, Dr Albert Zafy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its been a long, confusing haul. The first attempt at voting, in November 1996, failed to achieve the absolute majority required by the Constitution but led to the elimination of 13 of the 15 presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two remaining nominees presented a puzzling paradox: Ratsiraka and Zafy are both previous presidents, both deposed from power in the past. The former was ousted after 17 years by public dissatisfaction at his damaging regime, the latter impeached by his Parliament in September 1996 on the grounds of contraventions of the Constitution. He was accused of money-laundering, exceeding his powers, and not enacting his promises to institute more democratic government structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madagascar went to the polls on December 29, and the 50% turnout, a month long in the counting, places Ratsiraka back in the presidential hotseat. This is the man under whose self-designed regime of &quot;Christian Marxism&quot;, the island's economy first began its devastating decline; the same man who blew $300-million on Soviet arms in the early 1980s, while there wasn't sufficient money to keep national roads negotiable, health services effectively operating or plumbing up and running; the man whose guards shot at unarmed protesters during 1991 pro-democracy demonstrations (led by Zafy) outside his palatial residence, an event which finally led to his displacement from government by an enraged populace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now only four years later, the selfsame public have voted to have him back.  Its an incongruous decision to any outsider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at a rally in Ambalavao in December, where Ratsiraka briefly had the tiny town waving flags and bopping to local pop, a few supporters explained their attitudes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Poverty increased with Zafy. Ratsiraka promises better things,&quot; a rally organiser asserted. She was not certain what these better things might be.  She remembered that he promised to build hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ratsiraka has foreign donors on his side,&quot; another rally supporter believed. Conveniently for his campaign, Ratsiraka's return in October 1996 from exile in France coincided with promises of foreign aid shortly after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, confirmed in December after lengthy and turbulent negotiations, is expected by many to be the life-belt that will haul Madagascar out of its current economic crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madagascar's economic collapse lost Zafy much of his popular support. Under his rule, international debt rose to $4-billion (equivalent to $340 per person) and inflation skyrocketed (it is currently pinned at around 40%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the four years he was in power, not one cent of international aid came into the impoverished country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For much of the Malagasy population. the island's politics do little to quicken heart beats. Midway through the national elections, there was minimal sense of anything one might label election fever. At the Ambalavao rally, political cynics were numerous. They were there for the music and to check out Ratsiraka the &quot;criminal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's corrupt, a few concurred, criticising Ratsiraka for indulging in gross capitalism - exactly what he claimed to oppose in his version of Marxism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look at his rings,&quot; one pointed, &quot;and have you seen his palace?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are simply voting for him because they know him,&quot; spat another. &quot; Malagasies are scared to take risks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's yet another &quot;better the devil you know&quot; scenario for many. Besides, a young medical student from Antananarivo suggested, &quot;People have forgotton.  They compare his time to that of Zafy, under whom the cost of living soared even more.&quot; Heads nodded in agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These men did not bother to vote again. &quot;What's the use?&quot; asked Lolo Rakotonirina, a local tour guide. &quot;Our politicians are like the Malagasy kestrel. They're greedy. They circle, looking for opportunities that will feather their own nests. Nobody is rich here except the politicians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed Malagasy politicians are notorious among their electorate for the backstabbing, bickering wrangles they indulge in. Likewise the frivolous fashion of shifting their loyalties and ideologies in order to stay hip and in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Understandably then, for many there was no justification for election excitement. That the final election contest was between these two men - rather than any fresh faces - and that it then produced such ambivalent results, is surely an indication of people's disillusionment in politics and their lack of faith in any politician's ability to brighten the island's future. Most Malagasies seem resigned to living with their kestrels ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - This week's guest writer, Hein Marais, paid a visit to a private deportation centre near Johannesburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A COUPLE of kilometres outside Krugersdorp lives a town of ghosts. The winches that once hoisted gold ore to the surface of Randfontein rust in fields of long grass. Lining the main street are grimy, melancholic buildings.  It's hot, and time seems to be slowing to a crawl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your car bounces past figures shuffling from one spot of shade to another.  To your left a South African flag droops over a building that has been honoured with a fresh coat of paint, a sign announcing it as the Dyambu Training Centre.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then you spot the electrified fences, razor wire and guards. You explain yourself, the gate swings open and Frans le Grange appears at your side, issuing a torrent of introductions and commentary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You step into a dim, long room. Officials are hunched over the long counter, a few heads nodding sleepily to a Boom Shaka tune crackling from the radio.  Behind them hangs a framed portrait of Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, his expression hovering somewhere between a smirk and a taunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Welcome to the Lindela Accommodation Centre,&quot; Le Grange says proudly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's one of the managers of this euphemism, a privately-run deportation centre for illegal immigrants. He informs you there are 720 people behind the brick-red metal door. Seven hundred-and-twenty surplus people, you think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he tells you: &quot;We try to make people feel at home here.&quot; That they can move about, that &quot;this is not a prison&quot;, that &quot;from this phone they can call anywhere&quot;. He points to a gaudy logo on a door: &quot;It says that all nations, all colours are leaving South Africa, back into the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when that door opens, it's in to a twilight zone, like those 1950s sci- fi flicks where the aliens lumber down emptied streets, transfixed by their displacement. Every head seems to turn, trying to decide whether you're good news or just part of another day. You've stepped across a threshold, on to the brink of the world. Before you, defined by state power, is the Other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's an old hostel compound, adapted to the exigiencies of economic decline.  It no longer hosts workers, but serves as a launch-pad for their expulsion - to a favela in Rio, an apartment address in Monrovia, a hovel in Xai Xai. And it squats there like a lesson in moral ambiguity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In five-and-a-half months, 15 000 people have passed through here. Down one side run offices where the act of expulsion is legitimated, organised and catalogued; nine Home Affairs staff work there, nine more will join them soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a square of lawn patches, a couple of thatched shelters and a matchbox spaza shop. Separated, the women sit on one patch of grass; the men aren't alowed to talk to them. In the distance, a train rattles by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lindela began operating on August 18 1996. According to Le Grange, it happened like this ... A company called Meritum Hostels had taken over much of Randfontein after the Wesrand Cons mine went belly-up back in 1989. The hostels were then bought by the Dyambu Trust, run by a group of high-powered African National Congress women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first, some of the hostels were run as a kind of hotel residence for a miscellany of workers from surrounding areas. Last June, when Police Commissioner George Fivaz announced his scheme to capture South Africa's 10 000 most wanted criminals, a flash-bulb of inspiration lit up some heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Grange recalls the thinking: &quot;If he caught them, where was he going to put them? You had all these &quot;illegals&quot; being held in prison, where they didn't belong because they're not criminals ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why not privatise part of the eviction exercise, and convert one of the hostels into a deportation centre? Fivaz liked the idea, says Le Grange. &quot;We have the premises, why should the government spend money to go and build new ones?&quot; Within a few weeks, Home Affairs gave the scheme the nod, and the trust was contracted to run the country's first central deportation centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You step down into a pall of puzzlement and anticipation. Lindela's unit leader, Judas Kgotse, has taken over the commentary, pointing out murals painted by deportees. He feels almost ... cosmopolitan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've experienced the world here. We've had Africans from just about every country, we've had France, Japan, Britain, Brazil&quot; - he pauses, with what sounds like regret - &quot;but no Americans ... and no Germans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people spend a week here. On Wednesdays the train for Mozambique is loaded (&quot;605 went this week&quot;), on Thursday it's Zimbabwe (&quot;201 yesterday&quot;), on Fridays it's Lesotho (&quot;33 this morning&quot;) and Malawi (&quot;35 by plane&quot; - a private contractor flies them out of Lanseria airport). The others take longer, much longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some come back. &quot;We've had people who've been here three times, Mozambicans mostly.&quot; These are lives propelled by structural realities that no high- voltage perimeter, no army of pen-pushers, and no cop with an ear for accents or an authenticating eye or a desire for a quick buck can alter. But orders are orders. And at Lindela, business, it seems, is business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slumped in the shade of the far wall are the Mozambicans. They're all young men, in their teens to late 20s. The Zimbabweans loll on their own patch of grass. To your left, people huddle by region - West Africans in one spot, Pakistanis and Indians in another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You wonder aloud what it feels like working here - and for the first time, Kgotse looks you in the eye: &quot;Most of the people here are poor - I feel pitiful, I'm sorry to say.&quot; You see him stiffen back into PR-mode, but not before he asks, rhetorically, &quot;As an African, how can I feel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's lunch time - 3pm, the last meal of the day - and guards are haranguing people into line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kgotse and Le Grange have other business to attend to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly, everything changes. That air of compressed resignation is gone.  Someone's thrusting photocopied documents at you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His name's Abdul Sattar. For five years, he's lived in Bophuthatswana and Johannesburg, he's in import-export (&quot;leather jackets, shoes&quot;), he's an African National Congress member (&quot;Mayfair branch&quot;), he paid a Home Affairs official called &quot;Peter&quot; R200 for his papers in Mafeking. Now, Home Affairs says they're false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm no thief, I pay taxes for five years,&quot; he says. He was robbed in jail and can't afford the R5 Lindela charges for a phone call; can you call this number and tell Ashrid he's here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone else starts towards you, then ducks back into line when a guard approaches. Food being slopped on to trays is the only sound: conversation is banned during eating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, Le Grange introduces you to Joao-Carlos Manuel, and saunters off.  He's a Brazilian sailor who's been in and out of the country for six years, he says. In October, he went to Home Affairs in Cape Town to apply for permanent papers and was told R3 000 would do the trick. He refused, and was arrested as an &quot;illegal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After weeks in Sea Point police station, he was moved to Pollsmoor, then to Lindela. On the advice of a Nigerian, he paid a Johannesburg lawyer R2 500 to get him out. There were arguments with the lawyer and he hasn't seen his money since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you check out his case with the lawyer, you're enveloped in a haze of contradictions. He told Home Affairs he was Angolan, then that he's Brazilian.  He applied for refugee status, then retracted his application. You're faxed a copy of his statement. Manuel says he didn't know what he was signing. Home Affairs says they think he's wanted for armed robbery in Angola. You wonder why, if that's the case, he hasn't been deported - he's been in Lindela for a month. The legal firm says they paid him back R1 500 on January 20, via a &quot; Tony Mambabela&quot;. The Nigerian's name was &quot;Tony&quot;, Carlos has told you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And you think, somewhere in there is Manuel's life, the story of the knife scars on his shoulders, his broken front teeth, his swollen lip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But right now, he wants out. &quot;Lindela is OK,&quot; he says, &quot;but the guards are shit, they treat people like animals, especially the Mozambicans, they beat them every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They tried to beat him once for speaking to a woman, he says. When he resisted, he was told to stop acting &quot;like a white man, like a gentleman&quot;. He laughs: &quot;Like a white man? I'm a Brazilian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheik Mohammed, a Burundian, joins the conversation and backs the allegations. He says the Home Affairs officials are almost as bad as the guards, except for a Mr Morris who &quot;respects people&quot;. &quot;This company is a business, they're making money,&quot; Mohammed sneers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compacted around you is not so much misery as 720 versions of fortitude.  Some, like John Yeboah, the wiry and startled-looking young Ghanaian, have washed up on these shores thanks to a false South African passport bought off a South Korean church group in a bid to find work in the Far East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, like the Mozambicans that crowd around you in their murky room, dare not step off this treadmill of survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, seven of their compatriots were dumped at Lindela. They had valid papers, but had refused to hand them to the police. Le Grange has already told you that &quot;some of the cops are a problem - they tear up papers or keep them&quot; when foreigners refuse to grease their palms. The seven furnished their papers at Home Affairs and were released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men around you have learned to make do without papers. Sandra, a Liberian, has not. Abandoned without a passport by her mother in Lusaka in 1994, she slipped into Zaire, sneaked back into Zambia, then declared herself at Beit Bridge, all in search of a Liberian embassy that will verify her nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You make some small talk, and tales flow ... of supervisors who pocketed their pay packets, then reported them to the police as &quot;illegals&quot; ... of random arrests on the street. In the corner you spot someone hugging the clock he's taking back to Mozambique. No-one else seems to have baggage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been inside for eight years,&quot; someone volunteers behind you in perfect English. You turn. &quot;Car theft,&quot; he helps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shit, it was probably my car,&quot; you say. He doesn't skip a beat, steps up to size you up and shakes his head. &quot;No, it was a family car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The room cracks up. And you blush, asking, &quot;You guys coming back?&quot; There's silence, until someone deep in the room says, &quot;You know why?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You walk back to the office, feeling a numb anger. As you step out of Lindela, you still can't figure out whether it was a question or a statement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - If ever you wanted a walking advertisement in support of legalised abortion, take Glenda Bateman. Fifteen years ago, while working in Johannesburg as a student nurse, she fell pregnant after dating a student doctor for just three months. To put it delicately, it seems a too large condom slipped, and bingo!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple agreed they were not ready to settle into domestic bliss, but abortion was illegal and they wanted to keep the matter private, so could not turn to any of the numerous doctors of their acquaintance. After several weeks of deliberation and vacillation, Bateman set off in her battered blue Mini for her home town in Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She had an appointment with a white farmer in Cato Ridge, known by hundreds (maybe thousands) of local lasses who found themselves faced with the prospect of single motherhood. &quot;At first I thought I could have coped with being a single parent, but it would have been difficult to continue my studies,&quot; she explains.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are sitting sipping tea in a tiny kitchen at the offices of Marie Stopes International, perched on the 11th floor of a building in downtown Johannesburg. The British-based charity is famed for providing reproductive health care worldwide, but was also not averse to doing a little abortion on the side long before the procedure was legalised in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bateman (34) is remarkably candid about an episode in her life which she now admits to having blocked from her memory until about two years ago, when she joined Stopes. It was while comforting a young woman who had undergone an abortion that she inadvertently blurted out her own experience - it felt like therapy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She went home and told her husband about the weekend in Natal when she suffered a botched backstreet abortion, carried out by a man whose medical experience emerged from cattle breeding, though he claimed to have had medical training. The farmer's method was to induce labour by inserting a catheter up the cervix and into the uterus. The result? An apparent miscarriage which could then be dealt with at a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bateman left the catheter tube inside for too long. &quot;We were supposed to take it out as soon as bleeding started, but I went to a braai that night and forgot.&quot; The following morning she woke up in pain and with a terrific temperature. &quot;I knew at once that it had become septic and that I had an infection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was rushed to hospital, where suspicious doctors and nurses bombarded her with a battery of questions about the cause of her condition. She held her ground over a three-day stay in hospital and the case was recorded as a miscarriage. Bateman and her young doctor parted soon after. He subsequently &quot; came out of the closet&quot; and accepted his homosexuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was just as well they had not gone the shotgun-wedding course - though Bateman says they had lunch recently and he expressed regret about having missed out on &quot;perhaps his only chance of fatherhood&quot;. She went on to marry and have three other children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did what most women who terminate do. I just blocked it from my mind and got on with my life,&quot; she says. &quot;It was gone; finished; over.&quot; At least until her first child was born. The baby girl died within a week and a flash of doubt entered her mind. &quot;Thankfully I never once thought God was punishing me for the termination. I gave my new-born daughter back to Him, grieved and continued with my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But does a woman ever really forget? She pauses, smiles sadly and replies: &quot; No, I don't think she does. Most like me just go into denial until something triggers the memory.&quot; She quotes studies in the United States that show many women reach their 50s and then begin to deal with the issue of a terminated pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was therefore surprised to hear Bateman argue so passionately in favour of abortion. She insists on a woman's right to decide whether or not to continue a pregnancy. Eyes glint with anger, even through slightly tinted spectacles, as she talks about abandoned or neglected children - invariably black ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was all right for wealthy white women who could afford to fly abroad or pay privately for abortions even when it was illegal, but it was my black sisters in the townships who had to bear children they could not afford or did not want to keep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her soft, almost girlish voice takes on a steely edge as she argues the rights of women not to be saddled with children they cannot care for. &quot;Even worse were those forced through desperation to go the unsafe backstreet route, and all the dangers that entailed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was because of the health risk women were taking that Marie Stopes opened its first office in South Africa in 1993, initially doing male and female sterilisation. The following year it quietly carried out the first abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We got referrals from doctors in state hospitals who were sympathetic,&quot; she says. &quot;We were careful and discreet, but if anyone questioned us we simply denied it.&quot; Initially there were more white clients than black, but as word spread and the centre of town became more Afrocentric, the ratio shifted to 40:60.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it costs about R600, most women are able to save or borrow money for the procedure, which takes only one hour from start to finish. &quot;We often get women coming in during their lunch time and going straight back to work,&quot; says Bateman. The whole things begins to sound rather like a factory assembly line: register, counselling, abortion, rest, depart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is the obvious danger that some people will begin to view this as an alternative to contraception. Which is why the clinic also offers family planning advice. Staff handle about 60 people each day, including pregnancy tests, pap smears and contraceptive information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you want to see a procedure?&quot; she asks suddenly. Er, no thanks. I politely decline with a smile. &quot;It's very quick you know, just a couple of minutes.&quot; Yes, I've heard. Just a quick suction and Bob's your uncle. But really, I'd rather not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk of manual vacuum aspiration (sucking out the foetus with a huge syringe) was making me queasy enough. I knew that just down the hall young women were being &quot;done&quot;, feet in stirrups. Queen's Another One Bites the Dust was blasting from the radio in one of the three &quot;operating&quot; rooms tastefully decorated in cheery floral peach and blue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When all is quiet, we set off in that direction. Bateman produces some of the instruments used, chief among them the syringe, looking suspiciously like an oversized cake icing piper. I always thought they used some electrical equipment similar to a mini vacuum cleaner. She demonstrates how it works and I squeeze my legs together at the prospect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not as painful or messy as people think,&quot; she says brightly. &quot;We only help clients between six and 12 weeks, so there isn't much to take out.&quot; Apparently six weeks produces about two teaspoons, or a nose-bleed full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bateman, who worked for the Methodist Church before joining Marie Stopes, is proud she has been able to help so many women make what is perhaps the most difficult decision of their lives. &quot;It's not easy, but the relief on their faces when it's all over is incredibly satisfying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about the emotional toll on her? &quot;I really believe that I can care for every single woman who comes through our doors. I don't ever want to feel too numb to care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the best moment is when a client comes in for a test and is happy to be pregnant. &quot;It's not often, but boy, it feels good and we all go around smiling for a while.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Hospitals around the country are having trouble meeting the demand for abortions, largely due to reluctance on the part of staff to take part in the procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one knows the exact number of medical professionals who have declined outright to help with abortions, but Helen Rees, respected director of the Reproductive Health Research Unit at Baragwanath Hospital, has estimated that as many as 50% of health workers nationwide are resisting getting involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to its staff constraints, Johannesburg General Hospital is able to perform only four abortions a day, and is booked until at least February 19.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital has received anywhere from15 to 44 requests a day, including many from women who were ineligible because their pregnancies were too advanced. Many patients have been referred from other hospitals which are not performing the procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know if we'll ever catch up,&quot; said hospital spokesman Trudy Schutte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Coronation Hospital, in Coronationville on the West Rand, only about 20% of operating theatre assistants said they would be willing to assist in abortions, hospital superintendent Dr A Manning said. So far, the hospital has been able to meet the demand for abortions, but its staff has been stretched thin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are unhappy it is being done at the hospital,&quot; Manning said. &quot;If they had a choice, I don't think we'd be doing abortions at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rees and others said they had expected to have problems with staff, given the controversial nature of the procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rees said most hospital administrators and doctors would have liked to have had six months to prepare, not just the two they were given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospitals were also stymied by more unexpected difficulties, such as not having the proper equipment on hand and a delay in the registration of misoprostil, a drug commonly used in abortions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Misoprostil has been approved for use, but because of bureaucratic bungling it wasn't properly registered. Gauteng officials hope the drug will be available for use within the next few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been a nightmare week,&quot; said Rees, though she added that she is confident things will smooth out soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff-training programmes have focused mainly on informing health workers about abortion and about the laws that regulate it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal is not to convert people who oppose the procedure, but to educate them so they feel comfortable taking part, said Xhosi Xaba, deputy director of the Women's Health Project, which has been running training sessions in three provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a middle ground of people who just need certain information,&quot; she explained. &quot;Then they need to understand that abortion is an issue of women's control of their bodies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Doctor Eva Ngwenya-Seobi points to the tiny male genitals, the little feet and the thumb inserted contentedly in the mouth of the 12- week-old human foetus she keeps in a jar of formaldehyde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is obvious, she says, that this thumb-sized boy floating in his amniotic sac was a living, kicking person before he was removed from his mother's womb in an illegal Soweto abortion 12 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her belief that the foetus was once as much a living person as anyone else is why she, along with many other medical professionals around the country, are refusing to perform abortions upon request.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health officials say resistance among medical staff is the main reason why many hospitals have yet to begin offering abortions. According to the Termination of Pregnancy Act, no medical professionals opposed to abortion can be forced to be involved in the procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I pray there should be more resistance, until they close down and stop doing them,&quot; says Ngwenya-Seobi, a general practioner in Duduza, a township on the East Rand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She recognises a medical need to perform abortions in cases where the mother's life is in danger. There were times during her training at Baragwanath Hospital when she removed dead foetuses from women who had undergone backstreet abortions. It was at Baragwanath that she obtained the preserved foetus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terminating a pregnancy for non-medical reasons, however, goes against her Christian beliefs and the respect for life that she says is basic to her profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The taking of life, as far as I'm concerned, is the most devilish thing a doctor can do. We go in to save lives, and here we are taking them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When patients come to her asking about ending their pregnancy, she tries to convince them they can keep and support the child with the help of their extended families. If they insist they cannot, she tells them adoption is an option. Out of every 10 patients who come to her to discuss abortion, Ngwenya- Seobi says she persuades seven to carry the baby to term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The determination of the other three to abort, however, does not mean &quot; society must descend to a lower moral standard,&quot; Ngwenya-Seobi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that abortion upon request is legal in this country, Ngwenya-Seobi, a mother of three, does not relish the prospect of telling patients where they can have the procedure done. If pressed, she will, but she will also try to convince them the procedure is wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to cut down on inquiries, she plans to hang a big sign in her office stating simply, and for all her patients to see: &quot;No abortions are done here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

This was after I had been sent to several different floors and wards. No one knew where I should actually go, judging by all the places I was sent to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was hoping for sensitivity. I was supposed to be 16 years old, and five weeks gone. But what I got was a nurse screeching out my request for all to hear. From others whose help I sought, I got shocked glances.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the walls were safe sex and child-immunisation posters, but nowhere did I see any posters or pamphlets to do with abortion advice. Neither did I see any signs directing me to where abortions would be performed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one ward I approached, nurses behind a desk. As I left I heard them laughing, who knows at what. But it didn't leave me reassured - just scared and worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally I got to someone who seemed to know something. She broke off briefly from her phone conversation and, without asking what sort of treatment I wanted, said: &quot;O batla (Do you want) termination?&quot; She too referred me to another floor, but I pleaded that I'd already been sent up and down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the people in the abortion unit probably weren't around because they'd also been moved from floor to floor. &quot;You know, I don't blame them if they've gone home, they've been moved up and down so much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I got the feeling I wouldn't be getting my abortion in a hurry. She said they were testing people, and they were booked for two weeks. She said something about not having the right medicines. I was told to come in the next morning because the staff left at 4pm. It was 3.30 in the afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Baragwanath Hospital, the woman at the gynaecological unit said I couldn't just come and ask for an abortion, but would have to get a referral from a clinic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I went to the Meadowlands Clinic, nearby. The man behind the counter said they weren't carrying out &quot;the top&quot;, because even though the law had been passed there was no equipment or medicines. He said he knew this because he had heard it on the news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh no, I just want a referral,&quot; I said, waiting to find out what procedure I was to have. One nurse said they'd just had a meeting to decide which department would take responsibility for abortion. She added that though abortion was legal, training still needed to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matrons at the clinic were sympathetic. They told me what steps I'd need to take to get an abortion. Because doctors at the main hospitals were busy, I was to be tested and counselled at a clinic, which would then refer me to a hospital with my details. If I was under 12 weeks pregnant, I'd be given some sort of termination pill, but if I was over 16 weeks, a doctor could still perform an abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was struck by their non-judgmental attitude and genuine concern. &quot;Don't worry, we can see you're anxious. Just come and we'll do the test,&quot; one said.  They encouraged me to relax and have some tea, not to panic if I was pregnant, and told me not to rush my decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But are abortions definitely happening at Baragwanath?&quot; I asked. &quot;Do they have all the equipment and medicines there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, of course they do,&quot; the matron said. &quot;You will come for the test tommorrow, then you can be referred to Bara straight away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the matrons told me they had had a couple of women coming for abortions. They seemed to recognise the trauma of having to make the choice.  One said: &quot;Don't worry, it's legal now ... We are all for it here, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At JG Strijdom Hospital, the matron in charge was also sensitive. Athough the hospital is not performing abortions, she is involved in counselling women seeking abortions. These patients, she said, were HIV-positive and sought abortions before it was legalised. She had referred them to Coronation and Hillbrow hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She asked how many months pregnant I was. &quot; About a month,&quot; I said. At more than 16 weeks, she said, there would be complications, but she seemed to think I could get help at Hillbrow or Coronation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hello,&quot; I said to the woman at the other end of the phone at Coronation &quot;I want to get an abortion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yo!&quot; exclaimed the woman, before handing the phone to someone who said I should come on Thursday morning, abortions would be starting then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I called Hillbrow Hospital, and was told to come on Monday. &quot;How long till I can get one done?&quot; I asked. &quot;It'll depend on your condition,&quot; she said. She seemed in a rush to get rid of me. &quot;Ok, 'bye,&quot; she said. And she hung up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - If a task team's recommendations are adopted, the Cabinet will continue to decide behind closed doors to whom the arms industry sells.  Marion Edmunds reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE government plans to keep secret its most sensitive arms sales, such as the recent proposed Syrian arms deal, despite calls for greater transparency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A governmental task team will advise the Cabinet before April that in cases in which a client requests confidentiality, or when a deal may jeopardise South Africa's foreign relations, it should not reveal details of the sale to the public or to Parliament.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task team, which is reporting to Water and Forestry Affairs Minister Kader Asmal in his capacity as chairman of the National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC), suggests that all other deals - those guaranteed not to cause a stir - can be reported to Parliament in reports twice a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the team, which has been working on the issue for a year, long before the Syrian arms debacle, include representatives from the Foreign Affairs Department, the National Intelligence Agency, Armscor and the defence industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed policy, dubbed the pragmatic/discretionary approach, is being hailed as a new policy on arms sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reality, however, the policy endorses the system adopted by the NCACC last year in which Cabinet secretly decides to whom the South African armaments industry can sell, without submitting marketing or export permits for parliamentary or public scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Task team chairman and director of logistic policy in the defence secretariat, Chippy Shaikh, said this week: &quot;The new policy will be, when adopted by the Cabinet, the best system of transparency and accountability that currently exists internationally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has been challenged by the director of the Centre of Conflict Resolution, Laurie Nathan, who participated in the task team's discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Nathan said the new policy was &quot;positive&quot; in that the arms control committee's report would now go to Parliament and be made available to the public, it was &quot;problematic in that it does not indicate what criteria Cabinet will use in exercising their discretion&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also pointed out that the qualifications were not, in fact, consistent with the requirements of the United Nations register of conventional armaments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would therefore be incorrect to say that the new policy is the best system of transparency and accountability internationally. It is likely that those arms sales that Cabinet wishes to keep secret are those which have political or military sensitivities,&quot; said Nathan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government has been left red-faced in recent months by the leak of details of a proposed R3-billion arms deal to Syria, which soured relations with the United States. Under the proposed new system, human rights organisations will have to continue to rely on such leaks to monitor the most sensitive South African arms sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed policy also weakens the separation of powers in Parliament, which is enshrined in the new Constitution, by preventing MPs from acting as a check on the Cabinet decision-making on arms exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Defence has already been seriously weakened in its ability to take on the Cabinet, with the deployment of its three most powerful and articulate MPs to other positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former committee chairman Tony Yengeni is said to have an ambassadorial posting, ANC MP Dr Ian Phillips, an avid defence analyst, has been deployed as adviser to Public Works Minister Jeff Radebe, and the outspoken ANC MP Tengiwe Mtintso has left Parliament to serve on the Gender Commission. With the departure of those MPs, the committee is expected to lose most of its clout.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Escaped gangster Joshua Rabotapi was reunited with his thumb and parts of his fingers this week after he was arrested at his luxury home in one of Johannesburg's northern suburbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say Rabotapi lost his digits in a shoot-out with police during a robbery in 1994 in which three people were killed. The gang escaped with a large cash haul.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And police got Rabotapi's fingers and, more importantly, their prints.  Forensic tests later connected the fingerprints to a string of other crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rabotapi (28) is allegedly the leader of a gang whose members were described by police spokesman Captain Jan Combrink as &quot;the cream of the crop&quot; among criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the arrest brought detectives closer to eliminating one of the most notorious crime groups in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gang, which goes by the name of its illustrious leader, recruits only criminals on the police's &quot;most wanted&quot; list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rabotapi himself was listed among the country's top criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police believe the gang's main reason for recruiting the most sought after criminals was to make it difficult for members to betray each other to law enforcers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rabotapi was arrested and held for a short time last year, but managed to escape from police custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week the elite organised crime unit, which infiltrated the gang last year, arrested Rabotapi at his home in Sandown, Johannesburg. Most members of the syndicate have been nabbed over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Combrink said police timed the arrest of Rabotapi to ensure there was no violence involved. &quot;He was leading a normal life and not like a a fugitive.  And the unit just got good information where to get him. We had to make sure that this guy is brought to court, so we had to get him clean,&quot; said Combrink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rabotapi appeared in court this week, charged with robbery, three counts of murder and two of attempted murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Combrink said police were investigating an additional 16 murders, 30 robberies involving R17-million, money which was stolen mainly from banks, and a string of other charges against Rabotapi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Despite Minister Sydney Mufamadi's best intentions, police lawyers persisted in fighting another losing battle in court, with taxpayers footing the bill. Mungo Soggot reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RESIDENTS of a Cape Town squatter camp awaiting damages after police torched their homes in 1991 may finally see their money, following a last- minute decision by the police to drop their appeal against the ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police gave up the fight against the residents of the KTC squatter camp outside Cape Town after a six-year battle in which police lawyers ran up legal bills stretching well into six figures, and amounting to nearly half of what the sqatters are asking in compensation - R500 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal costs for the appeal alone could not be determined at the time of going to press, but are reported to be close to R200 000. All legal costs in the case are to be paid by the police, with the taxpayer ultimately footing the bill.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battle is the latest example of the police legal machine fighting to the death claims against its officers - a practice Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi has vowed to end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi's office has admitted that the ministry is struggling to wean the police from their costly and embarrassing litigation habits, especially in cases involving human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood, however, that the residents' legal team approached Mufamadi's office and were initially told the police would not withdraw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi's office was unavailable for comment this week, and police referred all queries to the Cape state attorney's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The KTC saga began on a Saturday afternoon in October 1991 when a policeman fired a powerful signal flare into the shack of a resident, Enoch Hewu,who had been suspected of engaging in criminal activity. But the fire spread, and ended up destroying 39 other shacks as well. No one was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents filed a claim for damages against the police. The case went to court in August 1993, was heard for 10 days and then postponed until June 1994 when evidence was heard and both sides argued their cases. The residents won, mainly on the strength of a spent flare casing found at the scene and traced to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Robin Marais - who did not deliver his judgment until October 1995 - declared the police liable, and ordered them to discuss paying damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police responded by launching an appeal, asking for an extension of the court deadline because their lawyers had missed it. The squatters - represented by the Cape Town Legal Resources Centre - then applied to have the appeal struck down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appeal was eventually scheduled to be heard in July 1996, then rescheduled to last month because the supreme court had lost some of the trial records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior and junior counsel for both sides had finished the bulk of their preparations for the trial when police made the decision to withdraw. The police's legal team was headed by Charles Louw, SC, a frequent legal representative for the police. He also had been a member of the legal team in a four-year trial over police destabilisation in KTC which began in 1987. The case resulted in an out-of-court settlement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the original hearing, Judge Marais had been confronted with contradictory evidence but eventually sided with the squatters whose &quot;trump card&quot; was the discarded flare casing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court heard that the police had become increasingly hostile to Hewu, whom they believed to be involved in criminal activities. The court also heard how a sergeant had threatened to kill Hewu, or burn his house, shortly before the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the start of his judgment Judge Marais said: &quot;The implications of the factual disputes in this case are profoundly depressing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the plaintiffs' version as to how the fire started is true, members of the South African Police, with brazen contempt for their statutory obligation to protect the public and its property, deliberately set Hewu's house alight simply in order to harass him ...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - National Police Commissioner George Fivaz's warning this week that members of his force must shape up or ship out has caught even his most senior officers by surprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In inquiries to provincial police commissioners around the country, the Mail &amp; Guardian learned that they had been informed of the shakeup at the same time as the media, despite Fivaz's assertion that &quot;steps were at an advanced stage and would be implemented soon&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fivaz warned this week that &quot;heads are likely to roll at all levels&quot; following a major evaluation of &quot;performance, service and productivity&quot; by the police service. The shakeup, he said, was imminent and no one in the service would be immune, including himself.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fivaz's announcement followed one by Safety and Security Minister Sidney Mufamadi, in which Mufamadi said he would hold the commissioner to a written contract spelling out crime-fighting plans. Mufamadi said if Fivaz failed to live up to expectations he could be fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi's spokesman Maxwell Mulaudzi said this week that the contract would be drafted at the end of the month. He did not say when it would be signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Key indicators will be worked into the contract,&quot; said Mulaudzi who added, &quot;The public has been hearing about plans, but what we need is practical implementation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fivaz 's warning has angered police unions, who claim they have been excluded from the evaluation process. And senior police at the provincial level seemed equally in the dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Benjamin Bhembe of the Mpumalanga police said &quot;nothing specific&quot; has been communicated to them from the national office. He said the province received the same statement that was sent to the media. Police spokesmen from Northern Province and Northwest Province had received the same treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KwaZulu-Natal police representative Bala Naidoo said he has not personally seen &quot;any document to that effect&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Free State and Northern Cape police referred all questions to the national office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only in Gauteng did police say that Fivaz's instructions had been communicated to them. Police spokesman Azwinndini Nengovhela said they would be implemented &quot;with immediate effect&quot; though he was unable to specify how.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Ngobeni, a spokesman for Fivaz, said that as the commissioner was the one who had come up with the plan, &quot; it is only the commissioner who can give further information&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police and Prison Civil Rights Union (Popcru) accused Fivaz of bowing to outside pressure. Popcru general secretary Jacob Tsumane said the union saw the statement as an &quot;unnecessary threat that will further demoralise the police force&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until we see and are allowed to participate in drawing up such plans, we view his threats as those of a person playing to the gallery to please the public that he was fighting crime,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - KwaZulu-Natal has decided to close down its 2 000-odd illegal casinos and grant a few licences for big outfits. But the political wrangling is not over yet, reports Ann Eveleth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PLAYERS jockeying for position in the highstakes game that is casino gambling in KwaZulu-Natal are finding themselves confronting powerful political and economic interests in the province, a Mail &amp; Guardian investigation has found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At stake are five mega-casino-complex licences allocated to the province by the Vehan Commission. The provincial government is expected to open tenders for the lucrative licences, as soon as the province's estimated 2 000 illegal casinos are closed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a successful - if temporary - supreme court bid by illegal casino operators allied to the Gambling Association of South Africa (Gasa) to delay the closure of their businesses has started a verbal Cold War between supporters of small-time gambling and the large consortiums anxious to get their fingers into the province's gambling pot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result has been a flood of allegations and counter-allegations of political influence-peddling by vested interests. Hardest hit has been the Inkatha Freedom Party, with wide-spread speculation that Premier Frank Mdlalose's early &quot;retirement&quot; - which comes into effect at the end of the month - was hastened by gambling pressures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor has the party been helped by its recent admission that it received R50 000 from Gasa, and that IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi attended a secret meeting with Gasa representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest revelations to rock the party are that IFP MP Kisten Rajoo was involved in planning a casino for some of the controversial Ingonyama Trust Lands. Minority Front MP Amichand Rajbansi this week demanded an inquiry into the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G established this week that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In mid-1995, Rajoo did, in fact, approach several fellow IFP members in the provincial government -including former finance MEC Senzele Mlhungu, Mdlalose, education MEC Vincent Zulu and welfare MEC Gideon Zulu - with plans to bid for casino licences in several areas under the control of chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to documents in the M&amp;G's possession, Rajoo also had plans for developments ranging from IFP offices to clinics to hotels, all of which would revert to the chiefs &quot;upon capitalisation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Rajoo was a member of Parliament's Ad Hoc Committee on Gambling and Lotteries Legislation - a position he says he gave up in mid- 1996 when legislation was passed barring politicians from having casino interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rajoo said he also has relinquished plans to build casinos and is instead looking for &quot;outside casino bidders&quot; to provide them &quot;for the benefit of rural communities&quot;. But he plans to continue with his other development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Buthelezi has been listed as a trustee for Rajoo's KwaZulu-Natal Development Company, &quot;subject to Government of National Unity approval&quot;.  Rajoo said this week Buthelezi declined the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these revelations support allegations of close ties between gaming interests and the IFP, other sources say influence peddling in the industry crosses political boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It &quot;dates back to the arrival of the first slot machine in South Africa&quot;, said one source. &quot;First the National Party allowed Sol Kerzner to get a monopoly in the homelands, then other big groups tried to get a foothold by sweetening national politicians. As the NP dragged its feet over the implementation of a broader industry, the small guys decided to sweeten the provincial governments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If everybody involved is sweetened,&quot; the source added, &quot;the process could drag on forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gasa treasurer Ish Maharaj said the IFP has been &quot;unfairly targetted&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;Our members have given donations to many political parties. It wasn't the IFP, but the supreme court which agreed to extend our deadline,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Maharaj echoed claims by Rajbansi that the KwaZulu-Natal government's decision to close illegal casinos was an &quot;about-face&quot; by portfolio committee members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both argue that it was Sun International that put pressure on the government to close the illegals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another mysterious convergence of political interests was the appearance of Durban multi-millionaire businessman Vivian Reddy at a 1995 meeting with the IFP's Rajoo, Mhlungu and several chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddy was linked to the Sarafina II donor controversy last year and also has several African National Congress-linked business projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddy told the M&amp;G this week he had attended only this &quot;exploratory&quot; meeting, but declined to join Rajoo's consortium in favour of &quot;a 100% South African black empowerment consortium with no links to any political party or union&quot; which intended bidding for a casino licence in the province. He also plans to bid for casino licences in Gauteng and the Free State, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the illegal casino owners - like all the other role-players linked to this conflict - describe themselves as &quot;clean&quot;, they too have questionable linkages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Gasa's coordinator and legal representative Bob Douglas was the author of the widely discredited International Freedom Foundation-funded Douglas Commission into alleged ANC atrocities in exile. Maharaj said he was hired because &quot;we liked his presentation&quot;, but other sources said his selection was &quot;carefully chosen to appeal to the IFP government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Gasa maintains it represents a number of small and medium-sized businesses, Maharaj himself owns Durban's Millionaire Casino, the Palm Beach Hotel, the PLM Hotel and the Maharaj Lodge. &quot;We are small in the sense that the Palm Beach cost R10-million, while the Wild Coast cost R500-million,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Confusion reigns at the Pact ballet and dance companies as members and management come to terms with their imminent transition from a government-supported dance company to what they hope to be an independent company - due to the drastic reduction in state funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, for example, senior management of Pact ballet appointed a board of trustees for the future Pact dance company, but initially failed to tell current Pact board members who the appointees are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pact Ballet's artistic director Dawn Weller-Raistrick announced the appointments on Monday, three days after the Mail &amp; Guardian reported on horrific conditions under which Pact ballet dancers allegedly work.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weller-Raistrick, senior ballet mistress Nicky Middlemist and ballet master Bruce Simpson have been accused of abusing dancers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pact's future remains precarious, as it faces financial uncertainty, the fallout of a spate of resignations by senior ballet management, and allegations of unfair labour practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the criticism that was levelled at her in last week's edition of the Mail &amp; Guardian, a tearWeller-Raistrick summoned staff and dancers to a sudden meeting, where she asked for a vote of confidence in her management style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dancers present voted overwhelmingly in her favour. Three days later - on Monday this week and after a three-month delay - the names of the new ballet board were announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to insiders, the eight names came from a list supplied by an interim dance committee, which Pact's current board established at the end of last year to try to ease the transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new company incorporating both ballet and contemporary dancers is supposed to be established by April this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Pact dancers' contracts end on March 31. So each dancer will have to apply to the new company for a position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one knows who will be incorporated into the new company - if indeed there will be one - and what will happen to those who do not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old guard of Pact set up a controversial trust fund in 1995 to provide retrenchment packages for staff members employed before April 1 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How the trust, worth an estimated R14-million, was funded remains unclear.  The cut-off date for applications is April this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But dancers who have applied for retrenchment complain of being &quot;fobbed off&quot; by management. Only after taking industrial action, they allege, have they been compensated, often in the form of unexplained deposits in their bank accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One dancer who left Pact at the end of 1995 says she was never informed about the retrenchment package. She lodged an unfair labour practice and was eventually paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A document called Schedule One details the trust fund, and contains the names of Pact staff eligible for retrenchment packages, but according to several members of Pact's existing board, copies of the document &quot;are seemingly unavailable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone knows Schedule One exists,&quot; said one board member. &quot;But no one has seen it, and as is the case with the finer details of the trust fund and the future of dance at Pact, no one knows what is going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Pact chairperson John Kani has called an emergency full board meeting on February 10 to discuss the crisis at Pact.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the new academic year started this week at the University of Stellenbosch, two young black men arrived from the sugarfields of KwaZulu- Natal ready to be trained as wine-makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mzokhona Mwemwe (21) and Dumisani Zulu (20), both from Umlazi, were accepted into the university's diploma course in wine-making, but have been unable to start the course because they have no money for tuition and expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two students said this week that while they both aspire to one day make quality wines, they had a more immediate goal in mind: to see the traditionally white industry become more representative. At least temporarily thwarted in both respects, they lashed out at &quot;the complete unwillingness of the industry to accommodate them&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two students had come to Stellenbosch at the urging of Jabulane Ntshangase, the so-called &quot;wine ambassador&quot; of Spier wine estates and a vocal supporter of black empowerment in the wine industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntshangase recently intitiated a bursary scheme for disadvantaged South Africans, in conjunction with wine journalist John Platter and South African Airways, on whose wine selection panel he serves. The scheme provides bursaries for three disadvantaged students to study wine-making at Stellenbosch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwemwe and Zulu had seen Ntshangase on television, and telephoned him about the bursary scheme. Although three students had been selected for the scheme for the current academic year, Ntshangase told the two to come anyway, and that he would find a way to accommodate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far frustrated in his attempts to find help for the students, Ntshangase told the Mail &amp; Guardian: &quot;KWV is a racist institution where the top management have no desire to develop the industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwemwe and Zulu also accused the giant wine co-operative of trying to sabotage the efforts of aspiring black wine-makers by not offering them financial help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KWV human resources manager Theo Pegel and spokesman Arnold Kirby in turn accused Ntshangase of failing to act in the best interests of the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a little-known fact that we initiated bursary schemes for coloured people as far back as 1976, but we didn't make this commonly known because we did not want to blow our own horns,&quot; said Kirby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Kirby, KWV grants bursaries every year to 10 students studying various aspects of the wine industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntshangase pointed out in response that whatever efforts KWV has made, they have been insufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We still only have one qualified black wine-maker in the country and Mwemwe and Zulu still have no money to study,&quot; he said. The country's only black wine-maker is Carmen Stevens, who is employed by Stellenbosch Farmers' Winery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accusations and counter-accusations come amid KWV's attempts to convert into a company, and distribute its assets, valued at anywhere between R2- billion to R5-billion, to its 4 751 members, all of whom are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These assets were built up with the aid of special tax breaks granted to the co-operative under apartheid and through the Wine and Spirit Control Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntshangase has said that the plan is proof of KWV's intentions of &quot; perpetuating racism and maintaining the white status quo of the industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom took KWV to court over its plans to convert to a company, and won a temporary delay until March 25, while a commission analyses the pros and cons of the plan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Autocratic management and a failure to consult with affected rural communities is threatening Mpumalanga's revolutionary attempts to make its conservation areas pay for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was with the future of its conservation areas in mind that the Mpumalanga Parks Board granted commercial management of its reserves, which are largely undeveloped and which cost millions to run, to the controversial Dubai-based Dolphin Group for 50 years - in return for an estimated R12,2- billion contribution to the Mpumalanga Parks Board's budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of the move was to make the board self-sufficient within 10 years and to relieve the government of its current R55-million a year subsidy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the deal with Dolphin, and the failure of the parks board to consult, has outraged land claim activists, conservation organisations and affected communities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large media briefing, held this week in an attempt by the board and Dolphin to assuage their critics, only worsened the situation when a number of officials, including the land commissioner-elect of Mpumalanga, Durkje Gilfillian, were &quot;disinvited&quot; from the event by the board's public relations consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucky Ngwenya, spokesman for the Sangeco Forum, lambasted critics and the press for threatening his community's chance at jobs and development opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sam Mashego, chairman of a land development committee in the Blyde River region, and the only other community representative present, said that he had been completely unaware of the deal until the previous day, when he was invited to attend the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three villages represented by Mashego have laid claim to land on and near the Bourke's Luck Pot Holes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin reportedly has targeted the pot holes as one of its lead development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot tell you where we stand on this whole issue because the meeting today was my first introduction to the idea,&quot; Mashego said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But our communities are desperately in need of roads, clinics and other infrastructure and if a foreign company wants to lease some of our land from us, then we would be prepared to at least listen to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Mail &amp; Guardian visited the Blyde River Canyon on Sunday, many in the affected communities knew nothing of the deal..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who did likened it to their forced evictions under the apartheid regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moletele induna and elected community leader, Enos Chyloane, stressed that any attempt to cede commercial rights without consultation would be resisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is widely known that we want our land back,&quot; he said. &quot;In 1965, when the government bulldozed our homes and destroyed our community by scattering our people as far away as Pretoria and Grobblersdal, we had no voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, things have changed and if anyone tries to steal our heritage again, they will hear our anger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He rejected the notion of anyone enjoying 50 years of exclusive commercial control over the Blyde River Reserve or the nearby Blyde River Dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winus Mashile, regional chairman of the Land Access Movement of South Africa, a land-reform committee co-ordinating land claims in the Blyde area by the Moletele, Mashilane and Siklari communities, says that the board's greatest blunder was its failure to consult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are giving our rights away without first speaking to us,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Chyloane and Mashile insist that the proceeds of any leases be paid directly to their communities. The parks board, they said, should be paid only for environmental management of the reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourism operators, although critical of the board and Dolphin, still support commercialisation of the board's reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Economic sustainability is the only chance our reserves and conservation in general has,&quot; says Alan Johnston, owner of Zambesi Spectacular, the only tour group that is operating in the Blyde River Canyon itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This type of deal goes a long way to promoting that sustainability and also to increasing tourist numbers to the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An NGO which has been involved in drafting a code of ethics for the sector is in the spotlight for other reasons, reports Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A PRIME mover behind the creation of a code of ethics for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) is involved in a bitter dispute with a former employee, which has dragged his organisation into a costly - and futile - legal and labour relations battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ethics initiative - which has the backing of 900 NGOs across South Africa - is due to be unveiled next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It includes self-binding agreements on finances, the role of boards and staff, the use of assets within organisations, affirmative action and community input.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one of its chief proponents, Willem du Toit, CEO of Umzamo Development Project, a Cape Town NGO, has spent months and thousands of rands fighting a former employee in the industrial and supreme courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So bitter is the dispute that the funder of the NGO has suspended further assistance pending an audit report prompted by the former employee's allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nasiema Isaacs of Ottery in Cape Town, says she has been &quot;fighting Umzamo for justice&quot; for more than a year. Last Friday, the sheriff of the supreme court was sent into Umzamo's offices with a writ of execution to attach goods to the value of R8 500 - money the industrial court has decreed Umzamo owes her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Toit has refused to pay Isaacs until she details what allegations she had made to its German-based funder, Misereor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isaacs, who spent nine years with the NGO, said she could no longer bear the exploitative nature of the project and the financial uncertainties of the NGO sector, and last Jaunary offered Du Toit two options. She was prepared to work on a contract basis and get paid hourly, or take a severance package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After failing to strike a deal, she left anyway. Du Toit refused to pay her a bonus or severance package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isaacs approached the Department of Labour which advised her to seek relief from the industrial court. The court ruled last November that Isaacs was entitled to R8 500 and ordered Umzamo to pay by December 15. When it failed to pay, she was granted the writ of execution in the supreme court to attach goods to the value of R8 500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been victimised and harassed and blackmailed by Umzamo for more than a year,&quot; Isaacs said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Toit was not available for comment. However, his lawyer, Richard Brown, said the NGO could not pay her because there were still &quot;outstanding matters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown said Isaacs had made certain &quot;spurious allegations&quot; to Misereor and Du Toit wanted to know what she had said to the company before the money was paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was not made a condition of payment, it is not something which is included in a court order but it was an agreement between the parties,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said her allegations to Misereor had &quot;put the brakes&quot; on Umzamo's funding. He also alleged that Isaacs had been responsible for some of the problems in the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Hippler, of Misereor's Africa desk, said Umzamo's funding would be reviewed after the audit report is completed next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The audit will not look at management of the organisation - that responsibility lies with its board,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hippler declined to elaborate on the financial allegations against Umzamo. &quot; I am unable to give any specific information about what we are looking for in Umzamo,&quot; he said. &quot;But you can say that we are in dialogue with them to clarify certain issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - 'How am I supposed to feed my children if the taps don't work?&quot; asked a young mother of two in Eldorado Park. &quot;If there's no water, how do I wash myself?&quot; inquired a boy, adding that he had not bathed for two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were reactions by residents of Westbury, Riverlea and Eldorado Park this week after councils cut off electricity and water for nonpayment. The townships were turned into virtual war zones as angry residents set up burning barricades blocking off parts of suburban streets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South Western Joint Civics Association (Sowejoca) called a stayaway on Thursday as part of their protest. &quot;The present situation has to change because residents cannot afford to pay for their services,&quot; said Basil Douglas, an association representative. He warned pensioners not to try and collect their pensions because of the volatile situation in the suburbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents expressed anger at their mistreatment by the apartheid government but said that &quot;nothing had changed under the ANC&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had nothing under apartheid when they only looked after the whites. But now the blacks only look after themselves. What must we do?&quot; said one woman at a barricade blocking the main road in Eldorado Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesperson Superintendent Govindsamy Mariemuthoo said protestors set a school on fire and several policemen were injured. Cynthia Ndluli, a social worker from Eldorado Park, called for calm as tensions mounted in the suburb late this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the western Johannesburg suburb of Westbury residents burned barricades and provoked police and intimidated other residents. &quot;Why must we pay the full rate when the blacks only pay a flat rate for their services?&quot; said a resident, Ronald Jacobs. He added that blacks in Soweto and surrounding townships only paid a flat rate of R35 per month for water and electricity while residents of Westbury had to pay according to how much they used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They (the government) think we coloureds benefited from apartheid but we suffered the same oppression as blacks,&quot; said Jacobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobs added that he respected the police but the current protests did not involve them. If they wanted &quot;to maintain stability&quot;, he said, &quot;The police should rather leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An obscure law dating back 169 years could cripple the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's (TRC) amnesty process, Cape Attorney General Frank Khan said this week, announcing that he will challenge a landmark ruling based on the law which was made this week in the Cape High Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what could be a precedent-setting judgment, Judge S Selikotwitz ruled that a person could not be prosecuted for an offence that occurred more than 20 years in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was ruling in the case of a Maitland man charged with two counts of rape and six counts of indecent assault. The man, whose name was not immediately available, had been charged in 1995 for offences allegedly committed between 1970 and 1974.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Abel and Francois van Zyl, counsel for the accused, argued that the court had no jurisdiction over him. Acting with legal advice from the Legal Aid Board, they referred to an 1828 provision in the criminal code of what was then the Cape Colony, that held that crimes dating back more than 20 years could no longer be prosecuted. The only exception was the crime of murder. The provision was also included in the criminal codes of 1917 and 1955.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khan said he had been &quot;disturbed&quot; when he had seen the judgment. He theorised that it meant that people who had committed crimes before 1977 could be protected from prosecution and as a result would not have to seek amnesty. This could include several incidents relating to the 1976 student uprising and torture in detention more than 20 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will see if I can take this matter to the Constitutional Court,&quot; Khan said. &quot;It will be devastating if this judgment is used as an argument before the TRC's amnesty committee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRC spokesman John Allen said until the commission's legal advisers had studied the entire judgment, they could not comment on its implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, KwaZulu-Natal Attorney General Tim McNally said the old code was not unique, and it was not, in fact, necessary for the judge to base his judgment on it. He pointed out that the current Criminal Procedure Act of 1977 also calls for a 20-year time limit for noncapital crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the code, &quot;the right to institute a prosecution for any offence, other than an offence in respect of which the sentence of death may be imposed, shall, unless some other period is expressly provided by law, lapse after the expiration of a period of 20 years from the time when the offence was committed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNally said he could not speak for the TRC, but his opinion as attorney general was that several things resulting from the abolition of the death penalty &quot;need to be tidied up&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this was an issue not for the Constitutional Court, but for Parliament, which would also have to look at other legal gaps resulting from the abolition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He suggested that a number of serious crimes should be excluded from the 20- year limitation. It was clear, he said, that the legislators who drafted the 1977 act had intended that the most serious crimes should not have an expiry date.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A Stellenbosch family facing eviction from the labourers' cottage they occupied for 50 years won a costly three-month reprieve last weekend when Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom stepped in to help them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanekom - who is attempting to limit the evictions of rural farmers through new legislation - managed to persuade the farm owners to allow the family to stay on condition they paid rent of R500 a month, more than double what some municipalities charge for houses in far better condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian reported last week that Katrina Williams, her three daughters and four grandchildren were to be evicted from the farm Le Verger after it was sold and the previous owners reneged on a promise that they could stay there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanekom visited the women last Saturday, three days after he announced he was piloting the new legislation, the Extension of Security of Tenure Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when he arrived at the cottage, the sheriff of the court had already been there, armed with an eviction notice from the Cape Supreme Court, and the women were sobbing hysterically while they watched their possessions being emptied from their home and piled up in the dirt outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanekom headed up a hill to the farmhouse, where he entered into two-hour negotiations with its owners and their lawyers. When they bought the farm last year they were unaware of the Williams family's lengthy tenure and verbal promises made by the previous owner that they could remain there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new owners had given the Williams family R2 000 to help them in their search for accommodation and the money could now be used to pay the R500 monthly rental. They also agreed to bear the cost of water and electricity consumed by the family over the next three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanekom's representative, Helmuth Schlenter, said the family was now committed to finding alternative accommodation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The records of Cabinet meetings at which some of the most traumatic events of the period before the 1994 elections were discussed appear to have been gutted and sanitised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The records, released to the Mail &amp; Guardian by the National Archives in Pretoria this week, are written in the style of a corporate press release.  All pages are headed &quot;top secret&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials at the archives said the records did appear &quot;sanitised&quot; and that the original minutes were likely to contain &quot;more interesting material&quot;. The status of the original minutes is unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G had asked the archives for records of Cabinet meetings dealing with reports of the Goldstone Commission into &quot;third force&quot; violence, the June 1992 Boipatong massacre, the September 1992 Bisho massacre and the assassination of Chris Hani in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the 1996 National Archives Act, documents from the past 20 years are available at the discretion of the state archivist. All documents dating back more than 20 years are automatically available. Under the old Act, the embargo for Cabinet minutes was 30 years. The National Party had tried without success to increase the period of embargo to 40 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The records from the first Cabinet meeting after the Boipatong massacre - when Inkatha Freedom Party-aligned hostel dwellers massacred 42 township residents - quote ministers expressing their disappointment at the ANC's allegations of possible state involvment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ANC's allegations that the government instigated violence and was involved in murder holds no water (Die ANC se aantygings dat die regering by die aanstigting van geweld en by moord betrokke is, is sonder enige grond),&quot; the records note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They note the ministers also decided that, in light of the massacre, the government should express its condolences to the victims' families and that churches of various denominations should join in the mourning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The records add that the then justice minister, Kobie Coetsee, wanted Judge Richard Goldstone's commission of inquiry into &quot;third force activities to examine allegations of possible security force involvement&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same meeting, the Cabinet expressed concern about the breakdown of the Codesa talks after the ANC walk-out on June 23 1992. The ministers were briefed on the &quot;contributing circumstances that led to the current situation&quot; by National Intelligence Service operative Nel Marais.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The records say the Cabinet stressed the negotiations had to continue, and expressed an urgent need for &quot;talks about talks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notes from Cabinet meetings on the September Bisho massacre - when the Ciskei Defence Force gunned down ANC demonstrators, killing 29 and injuring hundreds -are similarly anodyne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April the next year, all the Cabinet records have to say of the Hani assassination is: &quot;The minister of law and order informed the Cabinet of more arrests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official minutes of Cabinet meetings began in 1978 on the instructions of former president PW Botha. Until then proceedings were jotted down in handwritten notes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The 'spy' alleged to have known about Chris Hani's assassination spoke to the M&amp;G this week, reports Stefaans Brummer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOHAMMED AMIN LAHER, whom the Mail &amp; Guardian identified as the mystery &quot; double agent&quot; who had advance knowledge of Chris Hani's assassination, this week claimed the death plot had been &quot;a conspiracy on both sides of the spectrum&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G last week published details from two documents in which &quot;Ramon&quot;, described as a double agent of the old Department of Military Intelligence (MI) and African National Congress intelligence structures, warned MI of the impending assassination. The documents claimed members of the ANC intelligence and security establishment would be involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC and the South African Communist Party this week called for a thorough investigation, saying they had always believed Hani's death on April 10 1993 had been the result of a conspiracy reaching well beyond rightwingers Janusz Walus and Clive Derby-Lewis, who are both serving life sentences for Hani's murder.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ANC also said it could find no evidence of Laher - who is believed to have used the aliases Joseph Khan and Dave Brunner - ever having had contact with ANC officials. The M&amp;G has received unconfirmed information to the contrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laher this week called the M&amp;G from an undisclosed location, denying he was Ramon or that he had been with either the ANC or MI. (In calls last week he said the &quot;only two people&quot; who could identify him as Ramon were dead.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laher claimed the documents had been part of a &quot;disinformation campaign, but with a shred of truth&quot;. He said the death plot had involved both ANC and apartheid security establishment members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not deny having been associated with Eugene Riley, the MI operative who had composed the documents which quoted Ramon as the source of the information. Julie Wilken, long-time girlfriend of Riley, has also identified Laher as Ramon. Riley died mysteriously in January 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laher claimed former ANC Department of Intelligence and Security (DIS) member Ricky Nkondo, now a National Intelligence Agency (NIA) division head in Deputy Intelligence Minister Joe Nhlanhla's office, had been &quot;associated&quot; with Riley before Riley's death. Former associates of Laher and Riley also made the same unsubstantiated claims that Riley and, according to one of them, Laher, had had contact with the same group of DIS officials to which Nkondo belonged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NIA approached Wilken last Friday, asking to debrief her on her evidence. When she agreed, an NIA agent who introduced himself as &quot;Trevor&quot; met Wilken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G later established that &quot;Trevor&quot; was in fact Nkondo. Deputy NIA co- ordinator Mo Shaikh this week confirmed Nkondo had visited Wilken, saying the approach had been offically sanctioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkondo is understood to have been put under official pressure subsequently to explain whether he had any knowledge of Laher, which he denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another twist, someone who introduced himself as &quot;Mao&quot; contacted the M&amp;G last week after the newspaper had anonymously approached the MI front company to which Riley had reported, Jacaranda Pamphlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G had asked a member of the &quot;company&quot; to find Riley's former handlers.  In response, &quot;Mao&quot; called the M&amp;G - unaware of who he was dealing with. He acknowledged knowing &quot;something&quot; about the documents Riley had delivered on the Hani assassination. This was before the paper first broke the news of the documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G has established that &quot;Mao&quot; - although it has no proof that it is the same person - had been a close associate of Nkondo's in the former DIS, and is now a senior NIA official. &quot;Mao&quot; and Nkondo gathered intelligence on the right wing for DIS in the early 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, it has been established that Laher earlier had close contact with the Johannesburg underworld of drug lords and syndicate crime. Apart from his contact with Riley, he allegedly had contact with former Civil Co- operation Bureau agent Ferdi Barnard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laher's father-in-law was Shariff Khan, described by police, intelligence and ANC sources as a &quot;godfather&quot; in the murky world of drug barons who co- operated with intelligence agencies. He died a number of years ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Craig WILLIAMSon, the spy turned media celebrity, was &quot; contemptuous&quot; in his attitude toward the justice system and the truth commission, the Pretoria Supreme Court heard this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson was appearing in the first round of a case that could become a landmark clash between the truth commission and the justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is facing a civil suit by Marius Schoon, the father and husband of Jeanette and Katherine Schoon - two people Williamson has previously admitted he and colleagues had killed in southern Angola with a parcel bomb. He is seeking to duck the civil suit by applying for amnesty from the truth commission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson arrived in court on Wednesday with a posse of security guards, some of whom were sporting ties with the logo of Saracen Security, a company linked to military advisers Executive Outcomes. Both Williamson and Executive Outcomes trade in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schoon launched the civil suit in 1995 after Williamson confessed to the killings in the London Observer, meaning Williamson has had the opportunity to approach the truth commission since it opened for business last year but failed to do so until now. However, this week he applied to the court for a postponement because of his eleventh-hour decision to go the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His postponement application threw in two additional grounds for postponement - that the case was &quot;not ripe for hearing&quot; and that he would be prejudiced if the civil trial goes ahead while criminal proceedings are pending. Williamson is also being investigated by police in connection with the Schoon matter, the killing of Ruth First and the bombing of the ANC London offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the court spent much of Wednesday grappling with the postponement application, Schoon and Williamson sat at opposite ends of the public gallery - Schoon, small and hunched next to his lawyer in the front and the portly Williamson squeezed between two body guards at the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schoon's attorney Karin Norval accuses Williamson in an affidavit filed with the court of a &quot;contemptuous disregard for proper procedure ... the delays in Williamson applying for amnesty were deliberate and a concerted attempt to delay justice ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He chose to ignore the cut-off date (for amnesties) and was seemingly contemptuous of the amnesty process to the extent of being prepared to take the chance and gamble on the cut-off date being extended ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Papers show that as late as November 14 1996 Williamson indicated his &quot; intention of possibly seeking amnesty&quot; and that at a pre-trial conference on January 9 Williamson's attorney, Allan Levin, did not disclose the amnesty application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summons was served on Williamson on August 18 1995, but he waited until November 30 1995 before asking Schoon to drop the suit as he intended seeking amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson claims he has been cautious about applying for amnesty because of its implications for his criminal liability outside South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is Williamson's second shot at obtaining a stay of proceedings. Last April Judge Mohammed Navsa dismissed Williamson's application, ordering him to pay all costs. Williamson was given ten days to file a plea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missing the deadline by a day, he filed a plea that denied all knowledge of the murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schoon's legal team, headed by veteran human rights advocate George Bizos, quote ANC intelligence chief Joe Nhlanlha, saying the ANC broke off talks with Williamson because it doubted he was being &quot;open and frank about his involvement in human rights atrocities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of going to press Judge van der Walt had yet to rule on Williamson's application for a postponement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson's counsel is advocate Guttentag of the Johannesburg Bar.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Top ANC women helped establish the country's first private deportation camp, reports HEIN MARAIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEVERAL prominent women members of the African National Congress are linked to a private company running South Africa's first private deportation camp.  The Lindela Accommodation Centre, in Randfontein on the far West Rand, is a central holding point for captured illegal immigrants before they are shipped home. The centre has processed more than 15 000 illegal immigrants - charging R22,75, including VAT, a head per day - since it won the contract from the Department of Home Affairs last August.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It currently has 720 immigrants under guard. Some inmates complained this week of beatings; those held are also not allowed to talk during meals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre's ultimate owner - Dyambu Trust - was created last year by a group of high-profile ANC women, including Deputy Speaker Baleka Kgositsile, Deputy Home Affairs Minister Lindi Sisulu, Adelaide Tambo, Lindiwe Zulu and Hilda Ndude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But only two of the women - Gauteng MPLs Nomvula Mokonyane and Lindiwe Maseko - are formally registered as its trustees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dyambu co-ordinator Daniel Mansell said this week he had advised the women not to register as trustees, because of potential conflicts of interests and because several were uncomfortable being linked to an operation that makes money from deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ndude said she regarded herself and the other women in the group as members of the Dyambu Trust. Dyambu's operations had &quot;nothing to do with the ANC or the women's league&quot;, but the group were &quot;women with vision, women who fought the struggle, women who are trying to bring change&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lindela was a &quot;way of contributing to the normalisation of South Africa ...  As much as we are not against foreigners coming into South Africa, we must assist our government in curbing the influx.&quot; South Africa, she said, has &quot; its own problems of unemployment and the high rate of crime&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mansell said he planned to call a meeting this weekend to clarify the women's relationship with Dyambu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women, who also include Nozizwe Nqakula, Nomatyala Hangana, Makho Njobe and Girly Pikoli, joined forces in April 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original idea, according to Mansell, was to buy a mining operation, from which profits could be ploughed into community upliftment projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group agreed in June to buy the accommodation facilities at Randfontein from private company Meritum Hostels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement with Meritum stipulated that the women establish a formal trust, a holding company called Newco Holdings and an operating company called Newco Operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mansell was appointed to oversee these entities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lacking the funds to consummate the purchase, however, the group agreed that Meritum Hostel's owners would continue to hold all shares and manage the operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A share of the profits from the operations is paid to Newco Holdings, which then &quot;distributes the funds to the Dyambu Trust or other activities it might identify&quot;, Mansell said. Dyambu also operates a nearby juvenile detention facility, and a catering business serving mines on the West Rand and East Rand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meritum's management secured the contract for Lindela on August 19 - 12 days after it tendered. Home Affairs was unable to comment on the allocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mansell said the group was &quot;fairly upset&quot; when it discovered the operations included Lindela. &quot;They didn't know how to handle it, especially Lindi Sisulu.&quot; Sisulu withdrew from Dyambu in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lindela's contract is renewed monthly. Home Affairs is soon to put out an open tender for the operation. In the meantime, however, Dyambu has refurbished an adjoining compound to hold an additional 1 000 deportees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Following the arrest of Dr Wouter Basson, SADF scientists are revealing details of its covert chemical programme, writes Peta Thornycroft</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCIENTISTS involved in the development of chemical weapons by the former South African Defence Force (SADF)have begun talking to authorities, giving details of the sale of chemical weapons technology to Libya after the1994 elections. The sales were without the knowledge of the present government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least one chemist, and possibly two more, have been co-operating with the authorities. One was a key figure in the programme, and was formerly connected to two SADF front companies, Delta G, the chemical factory and research facility at Midrand, and Protechnik, an analysis and defensive research laboratory near Hartebeespoort Dam.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chemists face an enormous dilemma - they don't know how much their former client Wouter Basson is telling the investigators prosecuting him for allegedly selling the designer drug Ecstasy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Basson is a doctor and toxicologist but not a chemist. As head of South Africa's 7th Medical Division, he was intimately involved with the chemical and biological warfare programme. He knows all those involved in the covert programme under which South Africa honed its technology for chemical warfare to First World standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information emerging about the SADF's chemical warfare development programme indicates the scientists involved made substantial use of the then South African Police's forensic laboratories for some of their base ingredients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1995 Basson acted as a go-between during negotiations by the parastatal Transnet with Libya to build part of a large railway construction project. Transnet was referred to Basson because of his well-established Libyan links. He claimed to have been involved in a hospital building programme with the Libyans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian has been told that some of the chemicals used in the SADF programme are stored in the region. Only a handful of men know exactly where the chemicals are hidden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Office for Serious Economic Offences is investigating the sale of Delta G to listed chemicals group Sentrachem, and the Roodeplaats animal testing centre to its directors. Basson was arrested last week and substantial documents were found at his Pretoria home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A breakthrough for investigators looking for the SADF's chemical warfare secrets was found in two trunks at the home of one of Basson's associates, Pretoria businessman Sam Bosch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the M&amp;G has established that the Belgian scientist who first claimed that chemical warfare had been used by the MPLA in the Angolan conflict in the late 1980s, so prompting South Africa to begin pouring millions into its own defensive programme, has been convicted of fraud. Dr Aubin Heyndrickx was recently found guilty of misusing funds from his employer, the University of Ghent, where he was head of the department of toxicology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgian police are still looking for 12 British-made chemical agent monitors which Heyndrickx bought with university funds. He said he destroyed the machines because they were defective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa spent many millions of rands on defensive clothing, gas masks and other chemical warfare equipment after Heyndrickx said the MPLA forces were using poison gas on Unita in the Angolan war. He refused to allow his findings to be assessed by his peers. His research project was done in loose collaboration with a clinic in Mavinga in southern Angola staffed by some SADF personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Defence Minister Joe Modise has stopped the South African National Defence Force (SANDF)from paying Basson's bail application legal costs. His deputy, Ronnie Kasrils, told the M&amp;G that Modise had ordered on Tuesday, after it emerged the SANDF was provisionally footing the bill, that no payments be made to Basson's legal team. Kasrils said the Basson charges were of a purely criminal nature and not related to Basson's SADF duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The office of President Nelson Mandela points out that Mandela never possessed a copy of the Steyn Report in which Basson's chemical warfare activities were detailed. Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana said press reports, including last week's Mail &amp; Guardian were incorrect in claiming that Mandela's office had sent a copy of the report to the truth commission for investigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has ruled out war with neighbouring Sudan in spite of what he termed &quot;massive military propaganda&quot; from Khartoum and the diplomatic stand-off between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomatic relations between Addis Ababa and Khartoum have been at their lowest ebb since the attempted assassination of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia accused Sudan of harboring some of the fundamentalists who tried to kill Mubarak as he arrived for the annual summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on June 26, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relations have been further strained recently, amid Sudan's claims that Ethiopia was helping an alliance of Sudanese rebels who have seized several locations in the Blue Nile Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first reaction on Thursday to Khartoum's allegations, Meles stated that &quot;there is no precondition for a war to break out between Ethiopia and Sudan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian News Agency (ENA) which reported the Prime Minister's speech, quoted Meles as saying &quot;...we know that the Sudanese government cannot confront us in war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meles said this in a report on the State of the Nation, assessing the country's situation during the past six months to the Lower House of the Ethiopian Federal Parliament, the Council of People's Representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia has persistently denied Sudan's allegations that its forces were supporting rebels who captured a huge chunk of territory in the Blue Nile Province last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ethiopians have had more than their fair share of war, blood-letting and suffering, and there is no question as to their desire for peace with Sudan,&quot; Meles said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to ENA, Meles affirmed that his government's current pre- occupation &quot;is not war, but agriculture, and sustaining the success it has achieved in the agricultural sector over the past couple of years toward food self-sufficiency.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - The Mozambican Attorney general's office has decided to commit to the Supreme Court a murder case in which the Manica provincial court's presiding judge, Valentim Sambo, is implicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sambo, who heads the highest court in the central Manica province, is accused of battering to death a domestic servant, Joao Jone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source in his office told the country's news agency, AIM, on Friday, that Attorney-General Sinai Nhatitima, after studying the case file, decided on Jan. 31 that there was &quot;enough evidence for criminal proceedings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the accused is a judge, the case has been filed with the supreme court, the source added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first public pronouncement on the case, on Dec. 2, the Manica Provincial Attorney, Daniel Magula, declared that there was sufficient evidence to accuse the judge of murdering Jone, despite the absence of a body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sambo is accused of killing his servant after accusing him of stealing six boxes of crockery and some clothing from the judge's wife. Jone was last seen alive on Nov. 7</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his disappearance, and contradictory statements by the judge, the servant's relatives notified the Manica provincial attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones' body has never been found and it is thought that Sambo may have buried it, or dumped it in abandoned wells in the districts of Gondola or Sussundenga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After receiving the case papers from the Manica attorney's office, Nhatitima handed them over to the criminal investigation police in Manica for further investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this highly publicized affair, Sambo, protesting his innocence, remained a practicing judge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's minister of special duties, Wole Oyelese, says the government has uncovered a plan by pro-democracy groups to disrupt local council elections in the country next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told journalists in Ibadan, Western Nigeria late Thursday, that the opposition groups planned to engineer student protests against introduction of school fees in tertiary institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a matter of regret that some unpatriotic elements within and outside the country are planning to visit their frustrations on the peace-loving and progressive people of Nigeria,&quot; the minister said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He named four opposition groups behind the plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), the National Liberation Council of Nigeria, led by exiled Nobel literature laureate, Wole Soyinka, the United Democratic Alliance and the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosop's former president and author Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed for murder in Nov. 1995 along with eight other Ogoni minority leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oyelese said government was in possession of details of a meeting allegedly held at Igolo, in neighbouring Benin, between Soyinka and officials of these other groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The meeting was called to fashion out strategies to use students to attack government functionaries and institutions to disrupt the forthcoming local government election,&quot; the minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no immediate reaction to the minister's allegation from the opposition groups, which have been campaigning for an end to military rule in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups want detained politician Moshood Abiola installed as president of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abiola is awaiting trial for treason after he declared himself president of Nigeria in June 1994, based on the 1993 presidential election, annulled by the last military regime of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The March 15 local council polls are part of a series of elections under the three-year transition to democracy programme of the Gen. Sani Abacha-led military government. The transition is expected to end in October 1998.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operation to recover the cars involves the Mozambican, South African, Zimbabwean and Zambian police forces.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the first day of the operation, the police apprehended 74 vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mozambican news agency, AIM, quoted a police spokesman as saying that on Wednesday and Thursday at least 30 cars were seized in Maputo and the adjoining city of Matola. He gave no figures for Gaza and Inhambane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman said that the aim of the operation was to crack down on the high rate of car theft in the region. The countries most affected by such theft are South Africa, Mozambique and Swaziland, he said, but recently organized gangs of car thieves had also begun operating in Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police operation was first launched in the central Mozambican cities of Beira, Chimoio and Tete on Jan. 25. In these cities, according to the police figures, at least 130 vehicles, believed to have been stolen, were seized.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chaos reigned in the area when police shot back with rubber bullets and tear gas at stone throwing supporters of the South Western Joint Civics Association, or Sowejoca, who were protesting against service charges.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters were demanding the same flat-rate charge system for services such as water and electricity, as is applied in the black areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the four killed was a seven-year-old boy who was shot. Others were an 18-year-old youth caught in cross fire between police and protesters and two men who had also been shot. Another man who was shot in the eye is in critical condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By late Thursday, hospitals in the area had treated at least 200 people for injuries caused by rubber bullets, buckshot and live ammunition. Three policemen were seriously injured and 11 others sustained minor injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association has called off the protests and promised that no further protest action would take place Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This decision followed an emergency meeting and an announcement by the Gauteng province head of local government and development planning, Sicelo Shiceka, that a team had been appointed to investigate the association's complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team will enquire into the question of service charge arrears and future payment systems. It will report back Feb. 17.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dar Es Salaam plant, along with those in Mbeya, Tanga and Zanzibar make for a total investment of some 50 million dollars by the company.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president and chief operations officer of Coca-Cola Company (USA), Douglas Ivester, said the plant, known as Kwanza, was jointly owned by an indigenous company, IPP Limited and Coca-Cola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting this Friday, the Tanzanian news agency, Shihata, said that the Kwanza plant has a production capacity of 10 million crates of soft drinks per year. It did not say how many bottles were in a crate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week in Johannesburg, Ivester announced a 220-million-dollar Coca-Cola investment in South Africa over the next five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company entered South Africa in 1940, where it has the largest plant in the region. It also has 16 plants in six other countries in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is Coke's 10th largest partner among a total of 210 countries in which it does business worldwide, a ranking which places it between the United Kingdom at ninth and China at the 11th position.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was shaken by the deaths of Sastra Chim Chan, Jean Bosco Munyaneza, Agrippin Ngabo, Aimable Nsengiyumvu, and Graham Turnbull on February 4 in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The personal courage that they manifested by serving with the Human Rights Field operation in Rwanda became all too clear the day they were ambushed and brutally murdered. Each of those men gave his life in support of human rights.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Montgomery, Alabama, there is a monument to those who gave their lives in the struggle for civil rights in America. It is a simple slab of granite upon which their names are inscribed: over it, flows a sheet of water.  Inscribed above it is Martin Luther King's favorite verse from Isaiah, &quot;Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an everflowing stream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someday I hope there will be a monument to those who gave their lives in the struggle for human rights all over the world. On it should be inscribed the names of these five men: Sastra Chim Chan, who fought against the genocidal Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, came to the United States, and now has fallen in Africa; Jean Bosco Munyaneza, Agrippin Ngabo, and Aimable Nsengiyumva, who lost their families in the Rwandan genocide, yet went on with their work for human rights despite threats of death; Graham Turnbull, British human rights team leader, engaged to be married in July to a Rwandan woman whose first husband was killed in the Rwandan genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please accept my sincere condolences on this sad occasion as well as my warm thanks to you and the personnel of the U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda for your courageous work.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Extract from the FAO/WFP Crop &amp; Food Supply Assessment Mission to Kenya, Oct./Nov. 1996)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the short rains have failed leading to further worsening of the situation is evident from the following Special Alert issued by FAO on 22/1/97:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*The outlook for the short rains crops (mainly maize, millet, sorghum and pulses) has seriously deteriorated due to insufficient rainfall during the growing season. The rains, which normally start in mid-October came late, became sporadic and the situation has recently turned into one of drought. In most parts of North Eastern, Eastern and Coast Provinces, and in the low- altitude areas of Central Province, widespread crop failures and deteriorating pasture and rangeland conditions are reported and water scarcity has become a serious problem for both livestock and humans.  Significant losses of livestock have also been reported. For these same areas, the failure of the 1996/97 short rains follows two consecutive failures of the long rains (March-May), thus worsening an already tight food supply situation. The Government estimates that some two million people are currently affected by the drought and that the number may reach three million it the situation persists. It has appealed to the international community for emergency food assistance for this section of the population.*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presently, one half of the country is severely affected. Trends indicate that the drought is spreading and that more districts will be affected in the days to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terrifying forecasts of impending mass hunger and thirst continue to filter in from many corners of the country as well as from the local media. Several deaths have been reported and malnutrition is rampant. Thousands of cattle, sheep, goats and camels are likely to perish due to drying up of water sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are growing concerns over the health of children, women and elderly, especially in pastoral areas. Families are also reported to be on the move in search of water and the signs are ominous as streams, dams, pans and even boreholes are swiftly drying up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rise in food prices, caused partially by a switch over to cash crops earlier as well as increasing banditry and livestock rustling has further added to the misery of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anticipated short rains crop failure has serious consequences for the drought affected population which is largely deprived of coping mechanisms, and the requirements for relief assistance will therefore greatly increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have received requests for urgent relief assistance from the Christian Community Services of Mt. Kenya East and the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK). NCCK has been asked to co-ordinate those efforts and come back to us with more details on the programmes. As soon as we receive the necessary information, we may come back to you with an Appeal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE, TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. EASTERN ZAIRE - information as of 7 February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 General</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) The fate of thousands of refugees and displaced persons in Eastern Zaire looks gloomy due to increased fighting and restrictions on the activities of humanitarian agencies. Shabunda camp has been abandoned as the 40,000 refugees occupying the camp fled on 5 February in view of approaching fight.  These refugees were last spotted in Matili, on their way to Kalima, west of Shabunda and further inside Zaire. In Lubutu and Amisi, deteriorating security situation led to the evacuation of UNHCR staff from Lubutu and WFP staff from Amisi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Between 26 January and 1 February, WFP delivered 379 metric tons of food from Kisangani to refugee camps and for displaced/affected Zaireans: 312 metric tons to Tingi Tingi; 49 metric tons to Shabunda, 3 metric tons for UNICEF/Tingi Tingi and 15 metric tons for displaced and affected people in Kisangani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) Cumulative WFP releases to the camps since end December amount to 1,625 metric tons of food: 1305 metric tons to Tingi Tingi and Amisi, 56 metric tons to Shabunda, 69 metric tons for displaced persons in Kisangani and 195 metric tons to UNICEF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">d) Previous to the recent movement of refugees from Shabunda, the refugee caseload in Lubutu and Shabunda areas was reported to stand at 288,760 people: 191,147 in Tingi Tingi, 50,313 in Amisi and 40,000 in Shabunda. The number of displaced Zaireans had also increased with close to 30,000 displaced in Kisangani and Lubutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Kisangani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) WFP flights from East Africa to Kisangani were suspended by Zairean authorities, and no flights took place between 30 January and 6 February. WFP flights to Kisangani resumed on 6 February with a Boeing 707. The plane will be doing two rotations a day, carrying 38 metric tons of food in each trip.  In total, 1,867 metric tons of food were received by WFP in Kisangani between 18 December and 1 February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Tingi Tingi and Amisi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) During the past week, the nutritional situation in Tingi Tingi has not shown improvement. An average of 24 people are reportedly dying each day.  Some 1,940 children receive supplementary feeding and another 280 therapeutic feeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) On 31 January a distribution was organised for 5,701 newly arrived refugees from Punia. This group received a one-week ration, in a distribution totalling 13 metric tons of food. Another 635 new arrivals were due to receive their rations on 2 February. On 1 February another distribution started in Tingi Tingi, covering 7 days' supply. The daily ration consists of 150 grams of maize, 120 grams of beans and 50 grams of CSB, for a total per capita daily consumption of 1,132 Kcal and 50.4 grams protein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Goma</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) A refugee woman was killed while travelling in a UNHCR truck near the town of Tongo, north of Goma. As a result, aid agencies have for the moment suspended activities in the areas north of Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 Bukavu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Fewer refugees are returning to Rwanda through Bukavu. Those returning continue to receive WFP high-energy biscuits at way stations. Tensions in Bukavu and apprehensions related to the government counteroffensive have been somewhat eased as a result of the recent military advances of the Zairean rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Clearance obtained from Zairean rebels for UN agencies and NGOs to provide assistance to returnees until Kigulube, half way on the Bukavu/Shabunda road. This may facilitate repatriation of the refugees still in Zaire. With the fighting intensifying in refugee concentration areas, this route would be the most direct access for repatriation. A mission will assess road conditions in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) ACT/Christian Aid have resumed activities in Bukavu and will concentrate on seed and agricultural implements distributions to local populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 Five UN human rights observers, a Cambodian, a Briton and three Rwandans, were killed on February 4, in an ambush in Karengera, in south-west Cyangugu. The observers were travelling in two UN cars, clearly marked.  Violence is escalating in the country, particularly in the western provinces of Cyangugu, Ruhengeri, Kibuye and Gisenyi, bordering Zaire, and incidents targeting staff of international organisations are increasing, with six expatriates killed in the past three weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 The escalating violence has led to the evacuation of all WFP expatriate staff to Kigali. Contingency plans for food deliveries are under discussion and it is expected that food will have to be transported in convoys, with military escorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 Only 1,675 refugees returned from South Kivu to Rwanda between 27 January and 2 February, as compared to 16,971 during the previous week. This drastic reduction is attributed to renewed fighting in eastern Zaire. The number of refugees seeking asylum in Rwanda is slowly but steadily increasing.  There are now 19,059 refugees in Rwanda, mostly Zaireans (13,959) and some Burundians (5,100).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.4 While food distributions are still being handed over by NGOs to local authorities, in some areas Commune Distribution Committees (CDCs) are already active in the distributions. WFP field monitors will work with the CDCs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.5. During January 1997, WFP provided 15,400 metric tons of cereals, pulses and oil, for distribution among returnees. This represents 1.017 million persons assisted with a monthly ration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.6 The Rwandan Government announced a new land reform policy, which recommends moving rural populations into group settlements. This policy will have a direct impact on WFP-supported housing and shelter projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 Humanitarian agencies have been authorised to import a new fuel shipment, the first since late October. The quantities of fuel authorised, to be delivered overland from Tanzania, will barely cover half a month's needs and do not include Jet A-1 fuel. It is hoped that a monthly quota of fuel may be agreed at the next meeting of the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee due to meet in Lusaka on 9-10 February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 The expected barge transport operation from Kigoma to Bujumbura, through Lake Tanganyika, has yet to go ahead, and is waiting for authorisation related to the use of the barges. In the absence of transport through this southern axis, the route from Isaka/Ngara to Ngozi remains the only route for supplies into Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 A total of 202,504 persons benefited from WFP food distributions during the week ending 3 February, with 425 metric tons of food distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. UGANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 The security situation in northern Uganda continues to deteriorate.  Looting, abductions and ambushes are occurring with alarming frequency. WFP is providing food to internally displaced Ugandans in the northern districts.  Oxfam and UNICEF are providing tents and plastic sheeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 An ambulance belonging to Afrika Aktion Hilfe (AAH), WFP partner for food distributions, was ambushed near Adjumani, Moyo district, on 4 February.  Two staff were seriously injured and have been evacuated by UNHCR to Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. LIBERIA AND SIERRA LEONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. LIBERIA - information as of 6 February</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 After seven years of civil war, Liberians have renewed hope that peace is at hand as the demobilisation process draws to an end. The cut-off date for the process has been extended through 7 February and could be moved back should soldiers continue to turn out for demobilisation. Approximately 20,000 Liberian soldiers have surrendered arms and gone through the demobilisation process. The total number of fighters has been revised from 60,000 to approximately 33,000. WFP has distributed a total of 500 metric tons of food commodities to the various demobilisation sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Especially large numbers of fighters have been turning out at the various disarmament sites since the 31 January deadline was extended last week. In light of this, ECOMOG has set up mobile units to accommodate high numbers of demobilising soldiers. UNOMIL has also reported the surrender of heavy artillery weapons over the past several weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 In its continued support to the bridging programme, last week WFP positioned 5 metric tons of food for EU and UNOPS projects. A further 20 metric tons was delivered to Harper, which will be used for distribution to demobilised soldiers and towards the implementation of micro-projects involving WFP food-for-work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. SIERRA LEONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 Security has deteriorated in the interior of the country over the past weeks. Recent fighting between Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) troops, Guinean soldiers, RUF, ULIMO-K and Kamajors in Kailahun have reportedly resulted in deaths. Clashes between Kamajors and the GoSL troops in Moyamba and Bonthe districts have also been reported, displacing thousands of returning internally displaced persons and local populations. Further attacks have been reported in Tonkilili district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 Seven people were killed in an ambush by rebels on 28 January on the Makeni-Kono highway. Illegal check-points have been set up soldiers, Kamajors and rebels on the highway, who have been soliciting money from motorists.  Fatal ambushes have also been reported on the Bo/Matotoka and the Bo/Freetown highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 The UN Security Council is considering the report of the Secretary- General recommending the deployment of 720 peace-keeping troops and 60 unarmed observers to oversee the implementation of certain aspects of the peace accord. While the Government of Sierra Leone is in favour of this proposal, the RUF has indicated that it would prefer fewer peace-keepers in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.4 On 3 February, UNHCR repatriated 1,400 Sierra Leoneans from Monrovia (by sea and by air). WFP has been providing emergency food rations at the Waterloo displaced camp in Freetown, transit point for the returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.5 January resettlement packages have been distributed to more than 40,000 people in nine chiefdoms in Bo district.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The CFA franc shed weight this week after last week's momentary gains, as the dollar continued to exert pressure on the international currency market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CFA opened the week at the nominal rate of 561.8 to the U.S. dollar, down from 552.6 at the beginning of the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dealers attribute the decline of the CFA to the phenomenal rise of the dollar in the past months, which has depressed other hard currencies including the CFA which is tied to the French franc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Ashanti Goldfields Company (AGC) produced a record 1.  1 million ounces of gold in 1996, the company said in its quarterly report released Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It achieved this following the inclusion of production at the Iduapriem Gold Mine for the first time from November following AGC's merger with the Golden Shamrock Mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the report, made available to the Ghana News Agency, Goldfields says it expects to maintain this rate in 1997. Goldfielfs says its output for the first quarter of the group's production year for 1996, running from September 1 to December 31 1996, stood at 264,737 ounces.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This compares with 228,551 ounces for the same period in 1995. Production from the Iduapriem Mine for November and December 1996 stood at 18,970 ounces.  At the Ayanfuri Mine, production increased to 18,187 ounces compared to 10, 310 ounces in the previous quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company says gold production for the first quarter was 205,082 ounces at the Obuasi Mine, lower than that of last year because of the rapid fall- off in production from surface oxides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says the improvement in the grade of underground ore delivered to the treatment plants has been maintained. With scheduled increases in underground production, it adds, AGC is budgeting to produce 850,000 ounces at Obuasi this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On surface mining, it says ore and waste surface mining rate declined from 15.9 million tonnes in 1995 to 9.8 million tonnes in the quarter under review.  Excavation for 1997 is planned at some 8.0 million tonnes per quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diamond exploration thrust continues to generate significant increases in the mineral resource available to Obuasi, bringing the increases in underground reserves and resources in the 15 months of operation ending Dec.  31, 1996 to over two million ounces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldfields says exploration continues in Tanzania, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Niger. In addition, it is conducting regional surveys and detailed geochemical surveys on various projects in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Senegal and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Ghana's Finance Minister, Kwame Peprah, said Tuesday there was need to review the country's World Bank assisted-programmes because they were becoming difficult to implement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our present political system, which is guided by the constitution, is beginning to influence the country's ability to carry out the desired adjustment required by the bank's programmes,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are beginning to be influenced by the nature of our constitutional arrangements. It is becoming difficult to carry out the desired adjustment that will carry us forward,&quot; he told the visiting World Bank President, James Wolfensohn, in Accra.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfensohn arrived in Accra from Senegal on Monday, on the second-leg of a nine-day African tour which will also take him to Mozambique and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana's portfolio with the Bank was 3.3 billion U.S. dollars as at June 1996. It consists of 39 projects and programmes with an undisbursed balance of one billion dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem now is how to build a consensus among the opposition, labor and the civil society&quot; in implementing the projects,&quot; Peprah said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These realities, he added, needed to be considered seriously. He said that Wolfensohn's visit might enable government and the bank to review Ghana's performance and then take action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peprah said price distortions, high inflation, poverty, employment had persisted despite 14 years of economic structural adjustment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke of the performance of the economy in 1996 and said although government failed to achieve its target, inflation was reduced from 70 percent to 32 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope to further reduce it to 15 percent by the end of the year,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inflation, he said, had undermined efforts to improve the environment for the growth of the private sector and the attraction of more investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfensohn, who is on a three-day visit, described Ghana as a &quot;leader&quot; in Africa because of the extent to which it has gone in taking &quot;difficult economic steps&quot; to improve its economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he dismissed suggestions that the World Bank was running Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are only assisting the country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS, New York (PANA) - United Nations Secretary- General Kofi Annan has said he will keep his troops and civilians in Angola for two more months, if a government of national unity and reconciliation is formed by the end of February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If by that time the government of national unity and reconciliation has not been formed, the Security Council may wish to consider appropriate steps to address the situation,&quot; he said in a report repealed Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that if Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos and the former leader of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, failed to meet his deadline, then the 6,638- strong U.N. Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM) will stay only till March 31.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Angolan government and UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, agreed on Jan. 23 to postpone the formation of a government of national unity until after Feb. 12, when UNITA's elected deputies were expected to arrive in Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formation of the new government is expected to be the high point of the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, the peace agreement signed in Zambia, by the government and UNITA, aimed at ending decades of civil war in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan said that though the peace process showed some encouraging developments in the last part of 1996, &quot;new delays and difficulties arose, especially in connection with the future status of Savimbi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savimbi has proposed that he be given the status of principal adviser to the president of Angola, with a coordinating role over rural development, national reconciliation, and supervisory powers over some ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Active negotiations on the matter are continuing, and I very much hope that the parties will demonstrate the necessary flexibility and statesmanship in order to achieve the earliest possible resolution of this crucial issue,&quot; Annan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other aspects of the protocol's implementation that have been slow include the demobilization and integration of UNITA troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As at Feb. 1, some 70,660 UNITA troops were registered at the 15 U.N.  quartering areas while 5,895 UNITA officers and men were incorporated into the Angolan armed forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNAVEM III, which has been monitoring the implementation of the peace accord, is expected to transform itself into a follow-on mission that will oversee peace consolidation, confidence-building and national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The Zambian Supreme Court sentenced Masautso Phiri, the special projects editor of a privately-owned local newspaper, the Post, to three months imprisonment Tuesday for contempt of court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows an article Phiri had published on Dec. 11 1996, alleging that the full Supreme Court bench had been bribed by the state to dismiss an election petition filed by five opposition parties who are challenging President Frederick Chiluba's nationality, and therefore his right to rule the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hearing on the petition opened Monday in Lusaka in the presence of an observer from the International Court of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his article, Phiri claimed that the state had paid one million U.S.  dollars to each of the seven Supreme Court judges who were to hear the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper reported that the state was supposed to pay a total of 14 million dollars to the judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his ruling Tuesday against the journalist, Deputy Chief Justice Bonaventure Bweupe said the court felt that it would have been inappropriate to fine Phiri because his &quot;scandalous&quot; article had caused severe injury to the bench.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The custodian sentence of a sort will not be too long for Phiri to stay away from his family, so that he is allowed to have a quiet moment to reflect on what he wrote and praise God in silence,&quot; Bweupe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The title of Phiri's PostCard article on Dec. 11 was &quot;Praising God Loudly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bweupe's ruling came a day after Phiri apologized to court for alleging that its judges had been bribed by the state. He said that his article was not meant to ridicule the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phiri's lawyer, Sakwiba Sikota, pleaded for a non-custodian sentence saying that a fine would be more appropriate because Phiri was sorry for the &quot; unintentional&quot; injury to the bench.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (PANA) - The Liberation Front of Cabinda, also known as Flea/Fake, said Tuesday is was holding two foreign engineers working for the forestry company, Inwangsa-SDN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These two expatriates were infiltrated into this forestry enterprise by the Angolan government in order to reconnoitre Flea/Flac areas,&quot; the movement's secretary for external relations, Emmanuel N'Zita, said in Brazzaville.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accused the Malay and the Filipino captives of spying, and said they will be punished in conformity with the &quot;revolutionary law&quot; of the area it controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movement gave an ultimatum to Western investors, last week, to leave Cabinda, with a population of 650,000, because it was going to attack Angolan and foreign economic targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flea/Flac wants to shut down some 20 forestry companies, mainly run by Portuguese and oil companies, such as CHEVRON, ELF and AGIP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movement has been fighting since 1975 for the independence of Cabinda, an oil-rich area of some 2,807 square miles (7,270 square kilometers). It is bordered by Congo in the north and northeast and by Zaire in the south and southeast. Portuguese colonialists administered Cabinda as a province of Angola, although the enclave is not physically connected to the Angolan mainland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The second day of voter-registration for elections that should lead Nigeria to democracy continued Tuesday with no incidents amid reports of high turnout in parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were initial hitches at the beginning of registration Monday, with some centers starting the process late because of what officials of the National Electoral Commission called &quot;logistic problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in general, reports from across the country said the exercise proceeded without major hitches.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Lagos, the nation's commercial hub, registration officials were busy Tuesday attending to prospective voters at some 7,000 centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each center is expected to register 500 voters. By midday (1100 gmt), officials at several centers in the Lagos mainland neighborhoods of Surulere and Shomolu said they had registered up to 150 voters each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The registration is to last 10 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After registering, the Lagos State military administrator, Col. Mohammed Marwa, declared Feb. 12 and 19 half working days. This measure is designed to enable civil servants participate fully in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Marwa's counterpart in the northern state of Bauchi has a another solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from there quoted Col. Theophilus Bamigboye as having made the registration mandatory for the state's civil servants. He said the registration card is a must for civil servants to get their February salary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bamigboye ordered top civil servants at the directors-general level in the state to begin visiting their own local council areas and monitor the exercise to ensure that all eligible voters got registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Abuja, the nation's capital, Nigerian leader Gen. Sani Abacha and his family registered Monday in the presence of Sumner Dagogo-Jack, chairman of the National Electoral Commission chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nationwide registration is taking place in the 776 local councils in the 36 states that make up the Nigerian federation of some 100 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is for the March 15 local council elections and subsequent polls under the military government's transition to democracy, scheduled to end October 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five approved political parties are fielding candidates in the polls.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The general condition of some 10,000 refugees arriving in Salukwango, near Kalima in eastern Zaire, is &quot;very bad&quot;, according to UNICEF.  The refugees - who are predominantly Rwandan with some Burundians - recently fled Shabunda and were yesterday prevented from entering Kalima town by Zairean soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are now recieving assistance from UNHCR and UNICEF in nearby Salukwango. UNICEF flew in medical and nutritional supplies and gerry cans to Kalima yesterday. Concern continues over the deteriorating health of refugees in Tingi-Tingi camp, backed up today by disturbing pictures broadcast by CNN.  The report said about 200 were dying every week - predominantly infants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Zairean government has welcomed a proposal by European Union Special Envoy, Aldo Ajello, for a regional meeting. The regional meeting would be held before an international conference on the Great Lakes crisis - but Zaire reiterates former conditions that &quot;invading forces&quot; must first withdraw. A statement from the Foreign Ministry said the intended meeting would gather heads of states involved in last year's Nairobi summit as well as those from other African countries, and donors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Mohamed Sahnoun, Joint Special Representative of the Secretary-Generals of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity for the Great Lakes Region, is in Nairobi for consultations. After proceding to the Great Lakes region, Mr Sahnoun will be setting up an office in the region. A statement issued from the OAU headquarters in Addis Ababa said this week that OAU Secretary-General, Salim Ahmed Salim will give all necessary &quot;resources and support&quot; to enable Mr Sahnoun to carry out his task effectively. The OAU said Mr Sahnoun had &quot;briefed the Secretary-General on his activities since his appointment and the extensive consultations which he had so far undertaken in New York, Washington and Paris&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs Sadako Ogata, arrived in Kigali yesterday for talks on the refugee crisis in eastern Zaire, and is expected to meet Rwandan leaders during her three-day visit. She will also meet with representatives of humanitarian aid organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Government officials in Rwanda held a security meeting at the stadium in Kigali today. It was attended by Rwandan civil servants, and discussed increasing concern over deteriorating security. Yesterday four people were arrested in Kigali with mines in their possession. Witnesses reported yesterday that four dead bodies had been seen lined up on the road between Kigali and Gitarama. Last Sunday, eleven people were killed and twenty wounded in an ambush of two mini taxis just outside Kigali. On February 9, the body of a decapitated man was reportedly found outside a restaurant in Kigali. Five UN human rights monitors were killed in an ambush last week, while three Spanish aid worker were killed in an attack on their centre last month. Aid organisations have asked the Rwandan government for armed escorts for insecure areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said in Bujumbura yesterday that security needed to be completely re-established before repatriation of refugees could begin. Mrs Ogata met Burundi leader Pierre Buyoya and other senior officials in the northern town of Ngozi yesterday. Buyoya declared his country secure, and proposed joint missions with UNHCR to look into areas that will allow repatriation. He condemned the massacre of 122 Burundi refugees who were expelled from Tanzania last month, and said a customs officer and six soldiers charged with the massacre were on trial by military court. Mrs Ogata said UNHCR would participate in the joint missions proposed.  UNHCR says more than 92,000 Burundi refugees have returned from Zaire since October 1996; some 72,500 of those returned to Burundi's troubled Cibitoke region. Burundi is still gripped by regional sanctions following Buyoya's take-over in July 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Although there has been recent debate over the effectiveness of the sanctions (including concern that neighbouring countries are profitting from illegal trading) the Regional Sanctions Committee has so far remained firm that sanctions must continue until the hostile Burundi factions hold peace talks. Since January - as international concern over Burundi increases - Buyoya has endeavoured to project an image of calm control throughout most of the country. The regime sharply criticised the European Unions Special Envoy to the Great Lakes accusing him of mounting a campaign of disinformation; it also strongly protested a UNHCR report that said at least 1,100 civilians had been victims of the civil war, from early December 1996 to mid January 1997.  Buyoya pursued the same strategy in a meeting with former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, international representatives, and the &quot;Arusha group&quot; February 1-3: he accused international organisations of &quot;propaganda&quot; and &quot; fabrication&quot;, while at the same time challenging the UN to deliver a greater number of international observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next Regional Sanctions Committee meeting is reportedly scheduled for February 13th, after the February 10 meeting was canceled. Representatives of Buyoya and Nyangoma (CNDD) are believed to have held &quot;discrete talks&quot; in Rome, Italy, but there is no apparent progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa was quoted in the state-owned Daily News newspaper yesterday as telling a rally in the northwestern town of Ngara (Monday) that Tanzania was interested only in lasting peace and the restoration of democracy in Burundi. This was interpreted by news agencies as a rebuttal of allegations by the Buyoya regime that Tanzania is supporting Hutu rebels. Buyoya had also accused Tanzania authorities of blocking exports of fertilizer and seeds to Burundi despite an exemption granted by the regional countries. Mpaka - who last year ordered the repatriation of some 500,000 Rwandan refugees - told residents in northwestern Tanzania to be patient as the government was looking for ways of solving the refugee problem.  He thanked residents for sheltering tens of thousands of Burundi refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Burundian state radio reported yesterday that opposition leader Augustin Nzojibwani was taken into custody at Mbimba prison yesterday for &quot;setting the population against the public authorities and institutions, as well as...  undermining efforts to restore peace in Burundi&quot;. He had been under house arrest for a week. Nzojibwani is the Secretary General of the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), the main Hutu opposition party. Charges include those relating to giving foreign radio interviews which &quot;alarm the people&quot;. Last month, Nzojibwani criticised the government's policy of re- grouping returning refugees into what he called &quot;concentration camps&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has called for &quot;immediate and urgent corrective measures&quot; for the International Tribunal for Rwanda, following the release of a 50-page report today on alleged mismanagement. The UN report, by Undersecretary-General Karl Paschke of Germany, said that the review disclosed that &quot;not a single administrative area of the registry (finance, procurement, personnel, security, general services) functioned effectively&quot;.  However, no specific measures were recommended against two officials singled out for criticism - the Arusha, Tanzania-based administrative registrar and the Kigali-based deputy prosecutor. UN headquarters was criticized for failing to intervene as necessary, and for hiring staff without the requisite linguistic ability or relevant legal background. The report said that unless the prosecution strategy and leadership problems were corrected, &quot;the tribunal will have been created to little effect: the Rwandese will be right to suspect that justice delayed is justice denied&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* State-run radio in Rwanda reported yesterday that seven Rwandans awaiting trial for war crimes in Kigali have committed suicide in the last two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni met with French President Jacques Chirac on Tuesday for more than an hour in talks that focused primarily on the Great Lakes crisis. A spokesperson for Chirac said after the meeting that Museveni had reaffirmed his commitment to the principle of the inviolability of borders. Later in a press conference, President Museveni stressed he was fully committed to existing borders and denied any presence of Ugandan soldiers in eastern Zaire. The French government is widely percieved to be a strong supporter of Zaire's ailing President Sese Seko Mobutu, and allows him to stay in France at a luxury home when he is out of the country. Chirac has said that Mobutu is the only person capable of solving the crisis in Zaire.  Uganda has strongly denied sending troops to eastern Zaire; France and the United States have warned Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi against military intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Museveni's remarks on the inviolability of borders coincided with the announcement yesterday by the Zairean Ministry of Defence that a Ugandan military cargo plane crashed on Monday in the Ruwenzori highlands in northeast Zaire. The Zairean ministry claimed it was &quot;transporting a unit of soldiers and a large cargo of sophisticated military equipment&quot;. Today, a Ugandan army spokesman was quoted by AFP as denying the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rebels in eastern Zaire claim they established &quot;complete control&quot; over Isiro yesterday afternoon, according to a BBC report. Isiro is a strategic town northeast of Kisangani on the Ugandan border. The BBC also reported military sources in Kinshasa confirming that the rebel ADFL had taken Bafwasende.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* US diplomat Peter Whaley who visted Goma, eastern Zaire, yesterday reported that he found rebel chief Laurent-Desire Kabila absent from his headquarters. AFP reports a rebel spokesman in Goma saying that Kabila had gone on an &quot;inspection mission&quot; and that he did not know when Kabila would return.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - The U.S. State Department released its 1966 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1996 on January 30. Particularly highlighted among the African country reports by its length and strong language was the report on Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full texts of all reports are available on the Department of State's web site. Below are a brief excerpt from an interview with Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck, the portion of the preface describing rights reviewed in the reports, and the opening section of the report on Nigeria. There follows a listing of all the African country reports, with file sizes and URLs for retrieving them on the Web or by e-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*********************************************************</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices cover internationally recognized individual, civil, political, and worker rights, as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These rights include freedom from torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; from prolonged detention without charges; from disappearance due to abduction or clandestine detention; and from other flagrant violations of the right to life, liberty, and the security of the person.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Universal human rights aim to incorporate respect for human dignity into the processes of government and law. All people have the inalienable right to change their government by peaceful means and to enjoy basic freedoms, such as freedom of expression, association, assembly, movement, and religion, without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin, or sex. The right to join a free trade union is a necessary condition of a free society and economy. Thus the reports assess key internationally recognized worker rights, including the right of association; the right to organize and bargain collectively; prohibition of forced or compulsory labor; minimum age for employment of children; and acceptable work conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">***********************************************************</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following interview with John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, took place in Washington, February 3, 1997. USIA staff writer Rick Marshall conducted the interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Could you give a brief overview of the human rights situation in Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHATTUCK: Nigeria is certainly on the negative side. The Abacha regime oppresses its opponents; there's a great deal of arbitrary detention and torture toward its opponents. In the Sudan there's been persecution, enslavement of Christians in the south and a total lack of democracy. In Niger, a military regime suspended a presidential election it was in the process of losing. Mauritania has some continuing vestiges and de facto forms of slavery. In Burundi, of course, there continue to be massacres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the plus side, Rwanda, toward the end of the year, began to move forward with the return of the refugees from Zaire. Ghana conducted a successful free and fair presidential election. In Liberia, they're beginning to see the disarmament of the warring factions. Mali is continuing down the path of democratic constitutional government. Sierra Leone held free and fair presidential elections and signed a cease-fire agreement between the government and the rebels. And, of course, most dramatically, South Africa continues further progress with reconciliation and the work of the Truth and Justice Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">***********************************************************</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NIGERIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Sani Abacha, who seized power in a palace coup in November 1993, remained Head of State throughout 1996. Under Abacha, the main decisionmaking organ is the exclusively military Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), which rules by decree. The PRC oversees the 32-member Federal Executive Council composed of military officers and civilians. Pending the promulgation of the Constitution written by the Constitutional Conference in 1995 and subsequently approved by the Head of State, the Government observes some provisions of the 1979 and 1989 Constitutions. The decree suspending the 1979 Constitution was not repealed and the 1989 Constitutions has not been implemented. In 1995 Abacha announced a transition timetable which purports to return the country to democratically elected civilian government by October 1, 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government continued to enforce its arbitrary authority through the Federal Security System (the military, the state security service, and the national police) and through decrees blocking action by the opposition in the courts. All branches of the security forces committed serious human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the 100 million population is rural, engaging in small-scale agriculture. Nigeria depends on oil exports for over 90 percent of its foreign exchange earnings. The economy was estimated to have grown at a higher rate than the 2.2 percent of 1995 and the 1.0 percent of 1994, but at little or no margin above the population growth rate so that gross domestic product per capita did not change appreciably. Even that growth is deceptive, however, since much of it came from the petroleum sector with limited effect on the rest of the economy. The general level of economic activity continues to be depressed with factory capacity utilization remaining in the 30 percent range and many major companies reporting lower profits and expanding inventories. Endemic corruption further hindered the functioning of the economy. The Government has instituted liberalizing economic reforms through its &quot;guided deregulation&quot; program, e.g., investment and foreign exchange rules; but its controls over the economy remain extensive, including government-mandated, below-market fuel prices. There is a continued lack of transparency in government transactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights record remained dismal. Throughout the year, General Abacha's Government relied regularly on arbitrary detention and harassment to silence its many critics. The winner of the annulled 1993 presidential election, Chief Moshood K.O. Abiola, remained in detention on charges of treason, and in June unidentified persons murdered Abiola's senior wife under mysterious circumstances. The Government's investigation to date has been perfunctory. Security forces committed extrajudicial killings and used excessive force to quell antigovernment protests as well as to combat a growing wave of violent crime, killing and wounding a number of persons, including innocent civilians. Police tortured and beat suspects and detainees, and prison conditions remained life threatening; many prisoners died in custody. Security services continued routine harassment of human rights and prodemocracy groups, including labor leaders, journalists, and student activists. The Government also infringed on citizens' right to privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizens do not have the right to change their government by peaceful means.  Despite the announced timetable for transitions from military to multiparty rule, there was little meaningful progress toward democracy. In the March 16 nonparty local elections, the Government disqualified many candidates and promulgated a decree allowing replacement without cause of elected officials by government-selected administrators, effectively nulifying the results.  Local government elections on a party basis, originally scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1996, were postponed until 1997. The Government's reliance on tribunals, which operate outside the constitutional court system, and harsh decrees prohibiting judicial review seriously undermine the integrity of the judicial process and often result in legal proceedings that deny defendants due process, as in the 1995 cases of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others (who were executed) and former Head of State Olusegun Obasanjo (who was convicted by a secret military tribunal). Obasanjo, his erstwhile deputy and outspoken National Constitutional Conference delegate Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, and more than 20 others, remained in prison for their roles in an alleged March 1995 coup plot. The Government's frequent refusal to respect court rulings also undercuts the independence and integrity of the judicial process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other human rights problems included infringements on freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, travel, and workers rights, and violence and discrimination against women. There were many reports of sexual abuse of female prisoners. The regime established a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in June, but it was never taken seriously by nongovernmental human rights groups and by year's end had no discernible effect on the human rights climate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement By Dr Alex Boraine, Vice Chairperson, TRC, February 11, 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission welcomes the decision by members of the Biko family to appear before its Amnesty Committee when former police officers apply for amnesty in connection with Mr Steve Biko's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law governing our work gives victims or families of victims the right to attend hearings and to testify or adduce evidence before the Amnesty Committee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also provision in the law for legal assistance for victims or families who qualify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We welcome it when victims or their families use the rights they are given in the law, just as we welcome it when perpetrators come forward with the intention of disclosing the truth about the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Full participation in the procedures laid down in the law can only improve the quality of our decisions and of the Commission's processes; for instance, the participation of victims' families can help ensure that full disclosure of all relevant factors is made (one of the conditions which have to be met for amnesty to be granted).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our view does not imply that we have any view on whether or not amnesty should be granted. The Amnesty Committee plays a quasi-judicial role when it hears applications, so it hears evidence and argument both from those applying for amnesty and those opposed to applications, then decides whether the application meets the requirements for amnesty laid down in the law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Fighting continues in eastern Zaire, with the army and rebel forces swapping claims and counter-claims. Increased insecurity and interrupted relief efforts have provoked refugee movement, with reports of refugees abandoning Amisi and setting up camp some five kilometers southeast of the largest camp, Tingi-Tingi - which houses some 120,000 Rwandans.  Reuters also reports internally displaced groups, with Zairean civilians abandoning villages around Tingi-Tingi and Lubutu. Aid agencies estimate only 15,000 arrived of the original 40,000 in Amisi arrived in Tingi-Tingi, leaving some 25,000 unaccounted for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources in eastern Zaire reported that ADFL rebels had rounded up an unknown number of the Shabunda refugees and were directing them back towards Bukavu, in the direction of Rwanda. There are unconfirmed reports in Shabunda of rebels seperating out young refugee men, and subsequent shots heard outside the town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel radio (Bukavu) reported that rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila had ordered his troops to stop advancing towards Tingi-Tingi camp. Aid workers remain concerned that continuing conflict may soon provoke refugees to abandon Tingi-Tingi camp, forcing large numbers into hostile and inaccessible places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata appealed yesterday for refugees to be given safe passage back to Rwanda. In a press conference held in Nairobi, she reiterated that &quot;Separation of the refugees from their armed colleagues remains one of the major problems faced by the UNHCR&quot;. She said it could be done by &quot;some neutral force&quot;. Analysts believe this would be difficult given the reported alliance between ex-FAR and Zairean soldiers.  Before leaving Nairobi, the Commissioner said pledges of support she received during her trip needed further discussions by UNHCR officers on the ground with local authorities in the region. She said she had reached a basic agreement in Kinshasa that the refugees should go back to Rwanda, but that they need to be provided with food and other emergency assistance first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kalonzo Musyoka - who held talks with Commissioner Ogata - said Kenya was unhappy with the follow-up to a regional summit held in Nairobi in December 1996 on the eastern Zaire crisis. He said in a broadcast on Kenyan television that Kenya and other African nations were excluded by the UN: &quot;We had this Canada-led initiative as you remember, which totally left out Africans&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean army says it intends to use aircraft and helicopter gunships against rebels in eastern Zaire. Despite reports of the much-touted counter- offensive faltering, a Defence Ministry official said that it had not yet &quot; got into high gear&quot; and that the army was &quot;ready for very decisive action&quot;, reports Reuters. Helicopter gunships and attack aircraft have been seen at Kisangani airport for several weeks. According to rebel claims, the Zairean army has already used helicopter gunships to attack rebel positions near the town of Lubutu, about 200 kilometers from Kisangani. Observers point out that an air attack has limited effect when used against guerrilla armies in thick jungle cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An opposition call for 'un jour mort' - a dead city day -in Kinshasa was reported to have closed down much of the capital; but its effectiveness was difficult to assess as it coincided with the end of Muslem celebration Idd Mubarak, taken by some as a public holiday. The central bank stayed open, some traders were operating on the outskirts of the city, but the business district of Kinshasa was reported &quot;quiet&quot;, and some government offices were closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike was called by Sacred Union the alliance of radical opposition parties (USORAL) demanding the removal of Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo. A student march has been called for February 14th. Opposition papers continue to support a negotiated solution to the conflict. Following a weekend conference, opposition leader Tshisekedi's party, UDPS, has also called for tripartite negotiations involving Mobutu and his crisis government, Tshiskedi and the UDPS, and Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mohamed Sahnoun, arrived in Nairobi today. He is expected to stay in Nairobi for two days before going on to the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European Union special envoy to the Great Lakes, Aldo Ajello, said in Kinshasa on Monday that the European Union wants to see elections take place in Zaire as soon as possible. Ajello told Zairean Foreign Minister Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda that Brussels wished to organize a referendum on a constitution to enable elections to go ahead. He also said the EU was determined to call an international conference on security and cooperation in the Great Lakes region, and that the current problems should be solved through negotiations and not by force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one diplomat, however, elections in Zaire will be &quot;impossible&quot; unless the conflict in the east is resolved. In eastern Zaire, North and South Kivu regions account for 14% of the population, and are considered an opposition strong-hold.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - In Eritrea, the country's youth organization has chosen family life education as a means to combat unwanted and early pregnancies, as well as HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This option by the National Union of Eritrean Youth and Students is contained in a document distributed at the African Forum on Adolescent Reproductive Health, which was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Jan. 20-24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union, one of the continent's oldest youth organizations (created in the 1950s), says that its objectives include providing youths with opportunities &quot;to develop to their full potential as growing individuals and as members of a young generation.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says that objective could be attained by supporting the aspirations of young people, their expectations and rights to acquire and develop knowledge, skills and values needed during the transition to adulthood and responsible citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union's major thrust after Eritrea's independence from Ethiopia in May 1993 has been the establishment of a multipurpose youth center in Asmara, the capital, with clinical and counselling services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, there is a plan to establish national family planning and reproductive health services for the youth, in conjunction with the ministry of health and the Planned Parenthood Association of Eritrea, using the union's regional network and existing generic health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Eritrea is one of the 26 African countries where female circumcision is widely practiced, the union has embarked on a campaign to discourage what is more formally known as female genital mutilation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is targeting community members and leaders to educate them on the risks and side effects of these mutilations. Concurrently, the campaign seeks to create AIDS awareness and prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the campaign's guiding principles is the 1990 Convention on the Rights of the Child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union has been waging two campaigns each year, focusing on family planning and reproductive health, STDs and AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigns serve as an opportunity for distributing information, education and communication materials on the reproductive health of young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The target group of these campaigns is the approximately 20,000 young people per year who perform national military service. Through them, the union hopes to send its messages on health to most parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the union is undertaking a five-year project focusing on preventive and primary health care, whose components include nutrition, hygiene, sanitation, healthy life-styles and the rights of the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has now embarked on the creation of Anti-AIDS Clubs in the country's 33 secondary schools. The focus of these clubs will be to create peer education regarding awareness and prevention of the disease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INHAMBANE, Mozambique (PANA) - Mozambique harvested 1.38 million tons of grains during the 1996 season, which represented a 23 percent increase over the previous year, when production was about 1.12 million tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's news agency, AIM, said Wednesday this was released in a report by Agriculture Minister Carlos Agostinho Do Rosario.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">His report was to a session of his ministry's Coordinating Council in the southern city of Inhambane. The report says that production of other basic foodstaffs, including beans and peanuts, also registered significant growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus in 1996, some 140,000 tonnes of beans were produced, compared with 130, 000 tonnes in the previous season. Peanut production reached 120,000 tonnes, 20,000 tonnes more than the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cassava production rose from 4.17 million to 4.73 million tonnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The harvesting of raw cashew nuts, one of the country's most important cash crops, grew by 99 percent in 1995/96 with a volume of 66,510 tonnes, compared with the previous year's 33,400 tonnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cash crop that showed a decline in 1996 was cotton. The 1995/96 production was 50,500 tonnes of raw cotton, whereas the previous year's was 53,000 tones, which means a decrease of about 4.7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister blames this decrease on various factors, such as the heavy rains and floods that hit most of the southern and central regions of the country in February and March 1996, as well as cyclonic winds in the central province of Zambezia and exceptionally low temperatures in May and August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other negative factors were insect pests, the high cost of pesticides and the irregular provision of financial resources.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United Nations (PANA) - Gross mismanagement and frequent violations of United Nations regulations have been found at the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report to be released Wednesday, the U.N.s Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), which investigated the tribunal in 1996, says that the problems have prevented the tribunal from prosecuting alleged perpetrators of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the agency says that the investigation failed to unearth corrupt practices or the misuse of funds, as alleged by certain staff members.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says that the &quot;judicial independence&quot; of the tribunal is unquestioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although many of the specific complaints made to the OIOS and others were not substantiated by the available evidence, the charges of mismanagement were not only supported by evidence, the team... found additional evidence that administrative support functions did not operate either efficiently or effectively,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Key administrators in the registry and the office of the prosecutor did not effectively fulfil their responsibility,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report was ordered in 1996 by the U.N. General Assembly, following complaints from staff members and U.N. member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency also criticizes the U.N. headquarters in New York for failing to provide &quot;essential support&quot; for the tribunal until it could become functional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a result, the tribunal has yet to achieve its goals and without such support it will not succeed,&quot; it adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the tribunal's registry, the agency says that none of its administrative areas, which cover finance, procurement, personnel, security and general services, functioned effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finance had no accounting system and could not produce allotment reports, so neither the registry nor the U.N. headquarters had budget expenditure information; lines of authority were not clearly defined, internal controls were weak in all sections...there was no proper management system,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It cites the example of a staff member who received overpayment and double payment to the extent that he owed the U.N. at least 34,000 US dollars as of Dec. 31, 1996, when his contract was to expire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although the overpayment was known since mid 1996, the registry did not initiate a salary deduction,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another case cited in the report involved the payment of 27,000 dollars for chartering an aircraft that failed to transport prisoners from a West African country to Arusha, Tanzania, the seat of the tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency also found administrative, leadership and operational problems in the office of the international tribunal's prosecutor, which is located in Kigali, the Rwandan capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Functions were hampered by lack of experienced staff as well as vehicles, computers and other office equipment and supplies,&quot; the agency says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lawyer posts were vacant and of the almost 80 investigator posts, only 30 had been filled,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other problems, according to the 49-page report, include tension between the registry and the prosecutor's office; recruitment of inexperienced or unqualified staff; short-term funding arrangements and the geographical separation of the tribunal's organs and lack of adequate infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problems identified in this report indicate that the tribunal is in need of substantial change,&quot; says Karl Paschke, under secretary-general for Internal Oversight Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a result, recommendations have been made by OIOS and we are pleased to note that a number have been implemented,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paschke says that a number of personnel changes affecting the chief administrative officer, the chief of personnel, the chief procurement officer and the chief finance office had been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that he had directed relevant departments and offices to take &quot;immediate and urgent corrective measures regarding the serious issues raised in the report.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopian television reported that the police in Harar were looking for the unidentified culprit who threw the hand grenade into the privately-owned Harar Hotel late Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said investigation was underway into the incident, but did not give the conditions of those injured, who are being treated at the government hospital in Harar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A series of explosions occurred at two government hotels in Addis Ababa and another one in the railway city of Dire Dawa, close to the city of Harar in 1996, killing several people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responsibility for the explosions at the three hotels and an attempt on the life of a senior Ethiopian cabinet minister of Somali origin in July, in which two people were also killed, was claimed by Al Itihad. This is a militant Moslem group allegedly supported by fundamentalist government in Sudan and others of similar inclination in the Middle East and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Itihad claims to be fighting for the secession of the vast Ogaden region of eastern Ethiopia, also known as the Somali Region, one of the nine regional states of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Itihad has set up training camps for fighters and saboteurs close to Ethiopian border in neighbouring Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopian troops raided the camps in October and December 1996, killing several hundred Al Itihad fighters and &quot;other fundamentalists from several Arab and other countries that support the fundamentalists,&quot; the government said at the time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Eight Nigerian soldiers and a motor-cyclist were injured Wednesday when a bomb exploded and damaged a military bus in Lagos, the nation's economic hub, police officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No death was reported but witnesses said the blast in the Idi-Roko area on Ikorodu road, north of Lagos, shattered the glasses of some houses in the vicinity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 26-seater bus, belonging to the Directorate of Finance and Administraion of the Nigerian Army, was conveying soldiers to their offices when the explosion occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said the injured were rushed to a nearby military hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said some arrests had been made and that the accident was being investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's was the fourth bomb within two months aimed at the military in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the previous two in Dec. 1996 and the third in January, at least three people died and scores more were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian authorities have blamed the past explosions on the opposition National Democratic Coalition, or Nadeco, which is campaigning against military rule in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coalition has denied responsibility for the blasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest blast comes three days into a nationwide voter-registration, under the military government's transitional programme to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Nigeria's special duties minister, Wole Oyelese, said the government had uncovered a plot by four opposition pro-democracy groups, including Nadeco, to sabotage the local council elections scheduled for March 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups also denied the charge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report of an investigation into the tribunal, released Wednesday, found gross mismanagement and violations of U.N. rules and regulations but could not confirm allegations of misuse of funds, nepotism and racism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said Wednesday that prosecutor Louise Arbor of Canada, deputy prosecutor Honore Rakotomanana of Madagascar and registrar Andronico Adede of Kenya would attend the meeting, scheduled for Feb. 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After that he (secretary-general) will take whatever steps he thinks are called for,&quot; Eckhard said. &quot;Whatever he decides to do after that discussion will be made public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eckhard said that the secretary-general was struck by the breadth of criticism of the Rwanda tribunal, set up by the Security Council two years ago to try those accused of genocide in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He still feels we are a long way from a properly functioning tribunal (in spite of steps to rectify the situation),&quot; the Eckhard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tribunal's chief administrative officer, the chief of personnel, the chief procurement officer and the chief finance officer have been removed in the wake of the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 49-page report detailed lapses by the tribunal's registry and the office of the prosecutor, and criticized the U.N. secretariat in New York for failing to provide &quot;essential support&quot; for the tribunal, based in Arusha, Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karl Paschke, the under secretary-general for Internal Oversight Services, which carried out the investigation in October and November 1996, described the report as a blueprint for action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - World Bank President James Wolfensohn has asked African governments to rigorously fight inflation by creating money and controlling expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The evils of inflation are that it drives investors away, stops growth and erodes the lives of the mass of the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfensohn said this at a press conference in Accra shortly before departing for Cape Town, South Africa, on the third-leg of his nine-day tour four-nation African tour which ends in Mozambique.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had extensive discussions with President Jerry Rawlings, ministers and businessmen and saw a range of considerable possibilities in all sectors of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank was ready to assist businessmen in the private sector to help improve medium and small-scale industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the bank would like to see &quot;civil society, the private sector and ordinary people come together to agree on objectives clearly understood by the government so that we can have a strong economy that will bring benefit to all Ghanaians&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;we stand ready and, indeed, very anxious to participate in that effort&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfensohn acknowledged that not much has been done to combat poverty in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank, he said, was at the moment undergoing a major restructuring programme to ensure efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was encouraged by Ghana's democracy when he addressed parliament.  He promised to supply equipment and help to train the staff to allow the mechanism of government to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Touching on corruption, Wolfensohn said he was working with some industrial countries to come out with a code of conduct that will control and eventually eliminate the vice worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there was need to make business processes and practices more transparent by removing burden some regulations so that officials are not corrupted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the environment, he said the bank had supported Ghana's Environmental Protection Agency and mining industries in their efforts at keeping the environment clean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolfensohn was accompanied by his wife Elaine, two regional vice-presidents and the director for country operations for Ghana and Burkina Faso.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Sudan's minister for federal government, Ali al- Haj, expressed regret Thursday over what he called the silent attitude of the Organization of African Unity (O.A.U.) towards incursions by rebels into the country's south eastern areas bordering Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Khartoum had expected the organization, to which Sudan is a member, to have spoken out on the nature of the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this is a suspicious silence. We think that the O.A.U., if it were not wishing to write its own death certificate, has to take action,&quot; Haj told PANA in the Sudanese capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan has consistently accused neighbouring Ethiopia and Eritrea of backing anti-government forces of the Sudan People's Liberation Army in their January capture of the border towns of Kurmuk and Gaissan. Both countries have denied the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haj recently toured southern African states to brief their leaders about the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the O.A.U. should have commented on whether or not Sudan was justified in its complaints against Ethiopia and Eritrea. He said that after the June 1995 assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in Addis Ababa, the continental body reacted quickly and even globalized the matter, though it was a purely regional one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This does not look like the O.A.U. If it is convinced there was no aggression on Sudan let it say so but it cannot keep silent,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan was accused of sheltering Mubarak's would be assassins. Mubarak's motorcade was shot at as he was going from the airport to the venue of an African summit in the Ethiopian capital. Sudan has denied it is harbouring terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haj said in the case of the assassination attempt the whole matter was based on hypothesis and presumptions but in the attack on the border towns &quot; there are tanks, there are thousands of troops, there are people who got killed and there are hostages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether Sudan wanted the O.A.U. headquarters removed from Addis Ababa, he said:: &quot;Yes, it is possible that Sudan can take such a step. I don't see anything can prevent Sudan from taking such a step. But my understanding was that the O.A.U. should have taken such a move if it were not seeking to write its own death certificate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two West African leaders arrived in the Nigerian federal capital, Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian foreign ministry officials described the talks as &quot;crucial&quot; but did not elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three countries belong to the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, currently chaired by Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECOWAS maintains a peace monitoring force, called ECOMOG, in Liberia. The soldiers have been disarming combatants in that country's six-year old war, in accordance with the Abuja Peace Accords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disarmament process is a prelude to multiparty elections scheduled to be held in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyadema is also involved in diplomatic initiatives to end the territorial dispute between Nigeria and its eastern neighbor, Cameroon, over the oil-rich Bakassi peninsula in the Gulf of Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian officials said that the three West African leaders also touched on other issues including the ethnic conflicts in Africa's Great Lakes region, involving Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's commercial city of Lagos was calm Thursday after Wednesday's bomb blasts that injured at least seven people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security was tight at the two hospitals where the five soldiers, including two females were still receiving treatment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No death was reported in the blast that hit a moving army bus, damaged an electricity pole and left a crater on the sidewalks around Idiroko bus-stop on Ikorodu road, north of Lagos. The bus was conveying soldiers to work when the device went off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence Headquarters spokesman Col. Godwin Ugbo described the incident as &quot; unfortunate&quot; and said it was under investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police have reported some arrests in connection with the bombing, the fourth in Lagos within two months, all targeted at the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police are working on the theory that Wednesday's device had the same traits as three previous ones, two in December 1996 and one in January, all in Lagos. At least three people were killed and a score of others injured in those explosions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody has claimed responsibility for the bombings but Nigerian authorities have accused the opposition National Democratic Coalition or NADECO and other pro-democracy groups as being the brains behind the attacks. The groups have denied the charge but were still to comment on Wednesday's blast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, an official of the Nigerian Labor Congress has urged the government to widen its scope of investigation to include members of the armed forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If all acts of bombings were done by NADECO, it means there are many more members or agents in the armed forces yet to be identified,&quot; Mathew Agwujo, chairman of the congress' branch in the northern state of Kaduna reportedly told a labor conference Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - SEARCHING the Internet in South Africa does not begin and end with Ananzi (http://www.ananzi.co.za/), the Internet Solution's pioneering Web spider. However, as starting points go, this one is still pretty darn good. It provides both a search engine and a Web directory, combining the approach (if not the scope) of the Yahoo- type directory and Alta Vista style of search engine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key problem with Ananzi remains the fact that it does not offer a fully comprehensive listing of South African Web sites, since it depends heavily on site owners registering their pages. However, even Yahoo had to start somewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second problem is that basic searches tend to be as confusing and blunt as in Alta Vista. This is easily overcome, though, by using the formatting instructions you get by clicking on &quot;format your query&quot; under the search box.  For instance, as with Alta Vista, if you type in &quot;search engine&quot;, in those quote marks, you will be shown a list of documents containing the phrase.  Without the quote marks, you will be shown every document containing either word - increasing the reported documents by a huge magnitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest addition to the South African Web information searching galaxy is a creature not unlike Ananzi in name, but very different in function. The New Media Laboratory at Rhodes University has co me up with Gogga (http: &nbsp;//gogga.ru.ac.za/), an industrious insect that searches the news archives of the Mail &amp; Guardian, Independent Online, Financial Mail, Business Day, Beeld, Die Burger and the South African embassy in Washington. It requires similar formatting rules to Ananzi, such as using AND to combine keywords and OR to search for alternate keywords simultaneously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of format, the closest we have to a Yahoo-style directory, even down to the name, is Who's Hoo (http://www.whoshoo.co.za/cgi- bin/whoshoo/index.pl), run by FutureWave Media. It changed hands last year, and went through some teething problems, but appears to be back on track. Its directory lacks the depth and detailed breakdown of its competitors, but is easily searchable by keyword.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marques Systems/InterNeXt's (http://www.marques.co.za/) SA World Wide Web Database remains one of the most exhaustive listings of South African Web sites, while its ever-evolving ZA Worm (http://charybdis.marques.co.za/zaworm.  htm) provides search access to the broadest database of South African Web pages available. It scours only sites in the .za domain, though, so if your target sight has an address that ends in .com, it won't be turned by the worm.  The worm is also a very obliging insect, offering search parameters that include searching by title, address or body of a page, as well as formats like AND, OR and search strings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look out next week for the final part in our series on finding what you're looking for on the Web, when we go abroad once more to tackle the most powerful international search engines on the Web.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THERE'S a new generation of journalists emerging and they're not simply bristling with the cockiness of youth, but have a reassuring sense of social realism, and equally a sense of business sass charging through their veins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of trainee student journalists sensed an editorial niche in the market place to produce a free in-house campus magazine, The Edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 20 page full-colour, A3 format magazine is produced by the department of journalism at Technikon Natal, making this KwaZulu- Natal's first and only free student magazine, run by the youngest editorial team in the province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor Jude Mathurine (22) and assistant editor Kirstin Gevers (21) started the magazine last year during their third year as Technikon Natal journalism students. They believe that The Edge is having an impact on Durban campuses with hard-hitting features, polemical student issues and provocative prose.  Their distribution includes the four main campuses in the city - University of Natal, Technikon Natal, University of Durban-Westville and ML Sultan Technikon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a print run of 10 000 and six issues a year, Mathurine and Gevers estimate their readership at 35 000, targeting the 18 to 23 market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only are they familiarising themselves with the new technology and trends transforming the print media, they have also compiled a promo video for presentations to advertising agencies and business. &quot;It's a lucrative market for advertising,&quot; admits Mathurine. &quot;That's if you're dynamic enough with the resources and talent available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They've already got Sappi sponsoring 10 tons of paper and their advertising is certainly picking up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's our competition? Student Life. But their magazine is not free, and although it is a national magazine, editorially it is very Cape-oriented,&quot; says Mathurine, adding that The Edge's local appeal includes &quot;far more investigation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other competition includes the University of Natal's newspaper, Dome, and Rhodes Review from the University of Grahamstown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what to expect from the next (February) issue of The Edge?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, a feature on the rise of satanism in institutions of higher learning, and whether satanism should be a constitutionally recognised religion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous issues covered features that included a &quot;Rough Guide to safe sex: Advice for the young and hard&quot; and &quot;True life horror: Student abortion&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The standard of journalism in KwaZulu- Natal right now in the mainstream press is quite poor,&quot; says Mathurine. &quot;We had an interview with a big local newspaper and the reporter misspelt my surname. The mainstream local press is generally not very inspirational for us as hungry young journos!''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Local journalists have been asked to lobby support for US prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal. Rehana Rossouw reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH AFRICAN media workers, academics and journalists have been asked to add their voices to a growing clamour to save a journalist from execution by lethal injection in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of Mumia Abu-Jamal, president of the Black Journalists Association chapter in Philadelphia, were in South Africa recently to lobby support for the death row prisoner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are looking to this country for help as they are inspired by the freedom blacks achieved here, the abolition of the death penalty and the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To many African-Americans, Abu-Jamal is regarded as a political prisoner.  In 1969, at the age of 15, he became a member of the Black Panther Party.  This was followed by a career in journalism where he exposed numerous instances of police brutality in Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His sympathetic coverage of the Move organisation in the 1970s and 1980s - a black organisation which preached an alternative lifestyle close to nature - earned him the hatred of the Philadelphia police force which was involved in bloody clashes with the movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before sentencing, the prosecution told the jury of Abu-Jamal's membership of the Black Panther Party in an attempt to establish a motive as he had no previous criminal convictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthropologist and Abu-Jamal supporter Carole Yawney, who addressed a conference in South Africa on the beliefs of the Move organisation, said there was much South Africans could do to support Abu-Jamal. &quot;He represents the revolutionary spirit in America, a spirit that was energised by the freedom blacks achieved in South Africa,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The parallels between what is happening in South Africa and Philadelphia are uncanny. Look at the Steve Biko case, how the truth is emerging from police officers years after a brutal murder. This is similar to the investigation into corruption among the Philadelphia police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new African nation in the US supported the South African struggle against apartheid. South Africa abolished the death penalty, while the situation in the US is getting more repressive and the prison industrial complex is developing rapidly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of the people on death row in the US are black, poor white, indigent, Mexican and Puerto Rican. This is similar to the situation in apartheid South Africa,&quot; Yawney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She argued that South African journalists, in particular, could support Abu- Jamal by spreading the message of his imprisonment. In the past year, prison authorities have moved to censor him, refusing to allow him to broadcast from prison and restricting media interviews with him. This followed the successful publication of his book Live from Death Row.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all began in December 1981 for Abu- Jamal, a radio commentator who was moonlighting as a taxi-driver in Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He witnessed a policeman, Daniel Faulkner, assaulting his brother in the early hours of the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few minutes later, Faulkner was shot. The policeman died on the pavement and Abu- Jamal lay nearby, grievously wounded from a shot from Faulkner's service revolver. Six months later, Abu-Jamal was sent to death row by Judge Alfred Sabo - a judge who has sentenced more than twice as many people to death than any other judge in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1995, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge set a date for Abu-Jamal's execution: August 17 1995. Four days before he was to be executed by lethal injection, a temporary stay was granted after his lawyer petitioned the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for a new trial. The verdict is expected in April this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the US and the world, there is growing demand for a new trial for Abu- Jamal. His lawyer, Leonard Weinglass, has found significant new evidence which weakens the state's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weinglass has found new witnesses prepared to testify in a new case. The most significant of them is William Singletary, a black businessman who was never asked to testify although he had given a statement to the police after the shooting. He said he saw a passenger in Abu-Jamal's brother's car pulling a handgun. He heard a popping noise and saw the man put the gun in the policeman's face before running away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abu-Jamal arrived, asked what happened, and leaned over the policeman to check his injuries. The policeman then shot Abu- Jamal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Singletary claimed he was taken to the police station to make a statement.  He wrote four pages and was told it wasn't good enough. He had to rewrite it four more times. Police officers threatened to assault him, see his business destroyed, and his parents harmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He changed his statement, signed it and left. &quot;I felt like a lady who had been raped, I felt violated when I left. I couldn't rest because I knew what was right and wrong,&quot; Singletary said in an interview last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abu-Jamal has had minimal resources for his trial. Judge Sabo refused to allow him to conduct his own defence and a court- appointed lawyer was engaged and given less than $1 000 by the state for his expenses. The jury also had only two black members, in a city where almost half the population is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abu-Jamal's gun was found lying on the ground near the scene. It was a .38 calibre, but the bullet removed from Faulkner was fired from a .44 calibre weapon. There was no check to see if Abu- Jamal's gun had been fired, and no check for lead tracings on his hand - both standard police procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abu-Jamal never testified at the trial, saying the judge was hostile and it would prove no purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, allegations of police corruption and coercion emerged in the Philadelphia police force and the FBI was called in to investigate. In the months that followed 42 criminal convictions were thrown out when it was proven conclusively that police had fabricated evidence against the accused.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - IN 1995 The Media Futures SA study was released. This study looked at how people perceived media. Included in this study were some interesting findings on newspapers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Only 26% of the coloured, Indian and white market and 22,4% of the mass market found newspapers to be an important part of their life.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Nearly 50% of the mass market were getting their news from television or radio. This study was conducted before the relaunch of the SABC and one could assume that this trend among the mass market has been exacerbated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The positive aspects were that people felt newspapers kept them well- informed and helped them to find out what's on in their areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study revealed that delivery of news has been taken over by the electronic media and now newspapers must provide value for money, strong community focus and information beyond news gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Media Futures study is reinforced by an analysis of All Media Product Survey (AMPS) which reveal that readership of newspapers almost across the board is down and this has been a consistent trend since the 1988/89 AMPSS.  What is needed is the re- engineering of newspapers so they have more appeal to relevant markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Newspapers tend to re-position themselves either as strong community newspapers as the EP Herald has successfullly demonstrated, or they cater for a specific niche which Business Day does. Readers suffer from a &quot;time famine&quot; and newspapers should provide &quot;bite-size reading chunks&quot;, a successful formula for The Citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The traditional distribution avenues need to be reviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Magazines have been fairly successful in establishing loyalty via reader clubs. Newspapers should look at setting up clubs which cater for specific interests; for example, personal finance clubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Newspapers need to form strategic alliances with other media to create a symbiotic relationship which will enhance their editorials on other platforms as the Mail &amp; Guardian has done with SAfm and Business Day with SABC 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are a newspaper-poor society and newspapers need to engender a culture of reading.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Documents leaked to the M&amp;G reveal that BopBC is bordering on insolvency. Jacquie Golding-Duffy reports on its status</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation (BopBC), which has for 18 months refused to integrate into the SABC, is begging the North West provincial legislature for funds, warning that it is bordering on insolvency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents leaked to the Mail &amp; Guardian include a typed submission made to the North West provincial legislature executive committee (EXCO) sitting on January 29 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The submission, signed on January 15 1997, is an updated financial report by BopBC's acting general manager of finance Michael Levitt. He states that it should be &quot;noted that the Bop Broadcasting Corporation is operating in insolvent circumstances&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, BopBC acting chief executive Cawe Mahlati this week said it is &quot; incorrect&quot; to state that BopBC is bordering on insolvency, despite Levitt's submission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a fax, Mahlati says certain &quot;byzantine arrangements&quot; were inherited from the past which management has been untangling in order to prepare BopBC for integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, despite Mahlati's protests that BopBC is not cash-strapped, Levitt's submission lists &quot;commitments&quot; which BopBC owes for the period January to March 1997. The debts include payroll commitments to contractors (R3,6-million), salaries owing to permanent staffers (R300 000) and bonuses (R1,5-million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overseas creditors are owed R11,2-million, the Sandton office rental boasts a bill of R230 000 and Sefalano Employee Benefit Organisation (Sebo) is owed R2,1-million, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bop Recording Studios occupies premises owned by Sebo. BopBC's management contract with Bop Recording Studios was inherited from the former homeland government and mandates that Sebo be paid R673 000 per month. Mahlati says the payment was underwritten and guaranteed by the then-Bop government and is binding on BopBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his submission, Levitt says Sebo's rental &quot;has always been a contentious issue&quot;, adding that the revenue generated by the BopBC studios exceeds expenses if the rental is excluded. Mahlati, in her response to queries by the M&amp;G, agrees that the rental agreement brokered by the former government is uneconomic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says BopBC's management contract for Bop Recording Studios is unsigned.  Prior to her appointment, the corporation refused to pay the Sebo rental but the company then instituted an interdict and won. &quot;Upon arrival, I sought to retrieve the judgment court records. To date, I have not had sight of the judgment,&quot; says Mahlati.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the document, Levitt then states that the total amount required from the legislature is R19,8-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says because of uncertainty surrounding BopBC, advertising revenue has &quot; dropped to a trickle&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Should funding not be forthcoming immediately, the Bop Broadcasting Corporation will be unable to meet its payroll commitments for January 1997.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahlati denied that BopBC's advertising was dwindling, saying that Market Research Africa indicates otherwise. Despite the overall drop in radio listenership, and given the restricted transmission footprint and uncertainty about BopBC's future, ad revenue is healthy, argued Mahlati.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 1996/97, BopBC was voted a total grant of R50-million and has applied to the North West legislature for the balance of the grant, which is R20- million. Historically, she says, the homeland broadcaster received a blanket grant of R300-million of taxpayers' money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The request for finance is customary and not unusual, argues Mahlati.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of BopBC's financial difficulties also stem from its retrenchment packages which are estimated at being worth R29-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The beleaguered organisation was dealt a blow last year when the province's MEC for finance, Martin Kuscus, froze its funds. No money has been forthcoming since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kuscus, at the time, said his decision followed the uncovering of serious financial irregularities which included non-collection of taxes from employees and overpayment of benefits to some managers. Kuscus refused to speak to the M&amp;G this week, saying it is &quot;inappropriate&quot; for him to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, sources close to Kuscus say he has been gagged, while others argue that the issue of BopBC is a &quot;hot potato which no one wants to be drawn into, not even the Telecommunications Ministry&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a second hand-written document in the M&amp;G's possession , Levitt prioritises BopBC's cash requirements and says the submission requesting finance is only being prepared provided that BopBC manages to continue operating until the end of March this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the contractors' employment contracts, Levitt expresses concern that should the contractors not be paid for their services, the ramifications would be serious. &quot;I am of the opinion that if we do not pay the staff, it will have major political and social implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The adverse publicity would be very bad for both the North West and national governments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operating costs and debt, about R1,5- million, include unpaid electricity, water and Telkom bills incurred by BopBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Sandton debt, he says: &quot;The Sandton rental is subject to an agreement with Old Mutual Properties through JHI. Should we not pay this, BopBC would be sued in terms of the lease agreement which still has five years to run. An effort can be made to get a rent reduction and/or settlement to get out of the lease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Levitt continues: &quot;Ms Mahlati and I can make every attempt to cancel contracts which have not yet been flighted. Furthermore, possibly we could arrange to pay these in the next financial year provided we give the creditor a bank guarantee or irrevocable letter of credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will have to be paid ultimately, otherwise the ramifications are too ghastly to contemplate. It would affect the creditworthiness and credibility of the South African government in paying overseas suppliers. I also believe it would have an impact on the SABC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the promised bonuses to staffers, Levitt urges the provincial legislature to prioritise the cash for these bonuses &quot;in view of the negative publicity non-payment will generate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then apologies for the submission not being typed, adding that it was hand- written in the interest of speed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahlati says staffers were paid their bonuses, but some staffers say they have not been paid, among them DJs from Radio Sunshine and some cleaners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that Mahlati met SABC chief executive Zwelakhe Sisulu earlier this week to discuss speeding up integration plans but this remains unconfirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BopBC, caught between a rock and a hard place, is no longer digging in its heels against integration as the R93-million needed annually for it to continue operating is unlikely to be forthcoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A meeting will be held next week with the postmaster general, BopBC and SABC managements and the relevant unions to discuss the entire integration process, said SABC group services co-ordinator Leslie Xinwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xinwa said the former States Broadcasting Reorganisation Act which was legislated last October has to be studied by the parties concerned, before a date can be set for the final phase of integration into the national broadcasting service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xinwa was former chair of the joint integration management committee which paved the way for the integration process to take place in line with recommendations from the Independent Broadcasting Authority and which is contained in the Triple Inquiry report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report states that all television studios &quot;should be rationalised to ensure the most cost-effective use&quot; by the National Public Broadcasting Service (the SABC) for &quot;both internal production and as a revenue-generating resource through use by private broadcasters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also suggests that BopBC's external broadcasting obligations be assumed by the national broadcasting service and its facilities used for the proposed national broadcasting satellite and external services.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - KMMT BREY, a black Cape Town-based accountancy firm, has won a R3,4-million contract to market eight of South Africa's nine provinces abroad in a drive for direct foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Rafiq Bagus, chief executive officer of Investment South Africa, which awarded the contract, KMMT Brey is working with a United States- based consultancy, The Services Group. The two groups together had the capacity and experience to do the marketing necessary to target and attract direct foreign investment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described KMMT Brey as a &quot;black Deloitte &amp; Touche&quot; with offices and personnel in most provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bagus said that a similar marketing drive was under way in the Western Cape through Wesgro, and that it had provided a model for projects for the other provinces. Bagus said that about half the cost of the project would be borne by foreign donors, and the other half by the government. The contractors would be working with provincial government officials and the provincial MECs of Finance to work out what each province had to offer foreign investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was hoped that the consultants, particularly those with international experience, would transfer skills to their provincial counterparts through the project, which should be completed by June this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports released will comprise information on each province's strengths and will draw on other government studies about investment opportunities around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KMMT Brey beat more than 20 other proposals tendered at the end of last year to win the contract. The cheapest tender was less than R300 000, and, according to Bagus, hopelessly inadequate given the task at hand. The team that evaluated the proposals comprised top-ranking government officials in the Department of Trade and Industry, representatives from small and big business, the nine provinces and Investment South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The first stop for Investment South Africa is South-East Asia and interest is strong, Rafiq Bagus tells Madeleine Wackernagel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RAFIQ BAGUS'S new job is persuading foreigners to invest in South Africa.  No easy task given the fear of crime, but in his previous incarnation at Wesgro, he was instrumental in bringing Levi Strauss to the Western Cape. Now, if he could only persuade his wife to move to Johannesburg ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as chief executive officer of Investment South Africa (ISA), newly launched by Minister of Trade and Industry Alec Erwin, Bagus is looking beyond the headlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all relative,&quot; he says. &quot;For Asian companies, crime is not an issue when compared with Latin America, for example, whereas Europeans do worry about it. But the more foreign companies - big and small - we can encourage to set up shop here, the more others will follow.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, there's no point in denying the problem. We have to be realistic and upfront, and the sooner we are seen to be tackling crime effectively, the easier my job will be. There is an enormous amount of interest in South Africa - it's just a question of being able to harness it productively.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISA operates under the auspices of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), in close harmony with the department's other development agencies, including Khula, which provides financing, and Ntsika, which offers technical assistance, in a bid to include small, medium and micro-enterprises in building backward linkages. It's not just about the Fortune 500 companies - they come anyway; the smaller businesses are equally important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communication, stresses Bagus, is vital if his venture is to succeed. There is no point in going on a roadshow if the participants are not informed and co- ordinated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before we can start talking to the South- East Asians about inward investment, we have to find out what should be done, where the gaps are, and how best to tap their expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we called on the South African Chamber of Business, the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, the National African Federation of Chambers of Commerce, various government departments and labour representatives to give us their views. The government is always blamed when people complain that nothing is being done to boost investment. But it is up to the other constituencies to get involved and make their voices heard. We may not agree politically but if this country is going to work, we have to work together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting the private sector on board is a priority - &quot;preferably done yesterday&quot;, he says. &quot;We're looking at ways of involving their expertise - is it a matter of seconding someone, for instance? We can't do the job on our own, so building coalitions and networks is paramount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the same token, developing foreign networks is also important. Bagus points to the international figures who are already au fait with South Africa, such as Richard Branson of the Virgin Group. &quot;Our top-level politicians and business figures should leverage those relationships to encourage more people to invest here. That way we can build a network of the top foreign companies, which in turn bring others in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bagus is accompanying the president as part of the DTI and business delegations on a trip to the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore at the end of this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South-East Asia is enjoying a boom period - the potential investment opportunties are enormous. The Asean countries are also very keen on building South-South relations and they are keen to expand in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an annual budget of R5-million for the next five years, Bagus has sufficient funds to tap that goodwill. The organisation is not as unwieldy as some foreign counterparts, with a staff of only 16, but it intends to expand into branches abroad when the need arises and the interest justifies it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bagus, for one, is optimistic - always something new into Africa could well become its motto.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the recent riots have shown, cross- subsidisation between black and white areas has failed as a policy. Aspasia Karras reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE senseless death of young residents in Eldorado Park was not part of the transformation agenda of local government. What the chaos reflected was the latent social upheaval precipitated by the democratisation of institutional South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivor Chipkin of the Centre for Policy Studies, who recently completed a study on the eastern sub-structure of the Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council, maintains that the &quot;one city, one tax base&quot; concept that informed the new political unification and joint spatial planning in local government is in crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The political unification implicit in one city thinking has manifested itself unevenly in terms of spatial infilling,&quot; he says. The slogan captures the intention to correct the imbalances between black and white areas through cross-subsidisation, but in real terms this has not happened.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chipkin explains that the capital expenditure required for massive infrastructural development in the former black authorities was to be recouped through the cross-subsidisation theory. The study shows that despite a clear need to change spending patterns, levels of expenditure in former white areas have remained the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further problem is that the Budget was formulated to support the massive capital expenditure on the premise of 100% payment in all areas, but the Masakhane campaign is having little impact: Soweto is paying less than 25% of its rates bill and Orange Farm less than 0,1%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This implies that cross-subsidisation is not happening as envisioned, and as a result local government expenditure is far greater than anything it can actually afford. Many councils now face a serious shortfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sandton subsidises the rest of the metro to the tune of something like R450-million, which is why non-payment is an added crisis,&quot; says Chipkin. &quot;It is an irony that the apartheid financing system is still impacting at the local level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system, such as it was, established common regulations for rate collection, which governed white local authorities. These were, however, applied unevenly from council to council, so that what they charged bore little relationship to the services received. The rates payment was and is calculated in terms of a ratio of cents to every rand that a property is worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of uneven practices, Sandton paid one cent to the rand, while an area like Roodepoort paid eight cents. Using this imbalance, the Sandton council lured big business from the inner city, and began the process of unbundling the urban sprawl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rate has now been standardised using the principle of equity. For every rand a property is worth, one is now required to pay 6,45 cents across the board, while a rebate to the value of 60% applies for domestic properties.  This clearly accounts for the dramatic 300% increase that has brought Sandton rate-payers and the Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council to a courtroom stand-off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the black local authorities were kept afloat by inter- governmental grants (IGGs). The rates and service boycotts of the 1980s made the flow of IGGs a crucial element of financing what little infrastructural development took place. The flat rate was introduced to areas like Soweto in the 1980s as a means of inducing payment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, according to African National Congress councillor for Eldorado Park Jos' Coetzee, the flat rate debate is an inherited conceptual problem rather than a reality, since it is not currently being practiced within the greater Johannesburg TMC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The confusion arises from another apartheid inheritance, the provision of electricity. Soweto council payments do not fluctuate because they pay their electricity bill directly to Eskom. Areas like Eldorado Park pay directly to the council as the service provider.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, the tensions exist, and the looming financial crisis at local level bodes badly for delivery, which has now been placed squarely in the domain of local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IGGs have been replaced by direct subsidies from national and provincial government, but they are much less than before. Ralph Daskaurdt, chief director, development planning and local government in Gauteng, explains that the province gives local authorities R160-million for operational and capital costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in light of the impact of the growth, employment and redistribution strategy (Gear) and the low percentage of rate payment, local authorities are facing a financial crunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explains that estimates point to a reduction in government expenditure after interest in real terms by about 15% in the next two years - unless economic growth accelerates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gauteng Growth and Development Plan: Progress Report for 1996 points out that the sharp decline in real budgetary allocation in Gauteng, due to national fiscal restraint and increased redistribution of fiscal resources away from Gauteng, is leading to a &quot;structural deficit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Continued non-payment of rates, services and bonds in many areas in Gauteng is resulting in problems maintaining existing, and providing new, infrastructure and services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the problem is so acute in Gauteng, where local government is generally stronger than in other provinces, and characterised by a number of large metropolitan councils with substantial capacity and budgets, what are the prospects for the rest of the country's local authorities?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts are being made to deal with the fiscal crisis. Dominique Wooldridge of the Graduate School of Public Policy and Development Management (Wits) explains: &quot;Broke local authorities need capital for infrastructure.  Some are borrowing from the private sector, others are pursuing the public- private partnership route, while the capital budgets and service council levies are tidying most councils over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of loans to local councils through a fund set up by Southern Life, First National Bank, Thebe and other investors, is one way to go. The problem here is that a fifth of all government spending is absorbed by interest payments; more loans will exacerbate the situation, and impact on Gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other route is the one of partnerships. Daskaurdt is pushing this line in Gauteng, where two major meetings between province, business and local authorities, to establish partnerships for service delivery have been held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the issue that may be central to the financial crisis, argues Wooldridge, is the &quot;spatial pattern of apartheid urbanisation, with the poor on the peripheries, which are very expensive to service&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local authorities are faced with a planning crisis: Either they buy into the apartheid spatial plan, maintain the status quo, provide infrastructure at a loss while exacerbating the expensive urban sprawl; or they challenge the inheritance and begin slotting people into existing services while developing alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Development Facilitation Act, as well as the Gauteng project of setting land development objectives, are planning instruments that begin to deal with the issue. They also provide the opportunity for creative thinking about the role of urban governance in the globally competitive economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fiscal restraint imposed by Gear will catapult South Africa into the global economic paradigm of neo-liberal orthodoxy. Says Wooldridge: &quot;The impact of globalisation will be greater decentralisation and cutbacks in social spending. Local government will be required to do more with less. But globalisation also weakens the nation state and strengthens the local state, in the form of the competitive city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Increasingly, city-to-city agreements will become more common; businesses already relocate to cities and not countries; while the vision of technopoles as nodes of the global economy is being realised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is that the future is in local government; if Gear is to be realised, urban governance is integral to its success. But the rates crisis should act as a warning. We face a trade-off between services for the poor and the facilitation of global competition through hi-tech services and infrastructure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - JUDITH EDSTROM, the World Bank's resident representative in South Africa, is keen to dispel fears surrounding the operations of the institution in this country. In a recent briefing to the South African Institute for International Affairs, she emphasised the partnership aspects.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The relationship between the bank and South Africa has in many respects been pathbreaking, in that it has been driven by South Africa's demand for advisory services over lending.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edstrom points out the various areas where the bank's expertise is already being put to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has awarded small grants for early childhood development programmes, increasing Aids awareness among youth, school health education, public procurement reform to encourage small contractors, and telecommunications advisory support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional initiatives include support for the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, Maputo corridor, a regional power pool and a regional payments system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also under consideration is a loan to finance a Department of Trade and Industry initiative to improve international competitiveness of companies, to encourage exports and thereby, job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, so unthreatening. But fears of a &quot;big brother&quot; influence remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edstrom, however, disagrees. &quot;As the government now seeks to put the focus on delivery, the World Bank is in a position to share its vast experience in implementing programmes and projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bank's project expertise lies in assisting institutions on the ground to develop sustainable capacity - to plan, programme procure, implement and evaluate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Structural adjustment policies are interventionist and destructive, warns an economist. Gwen Ansell reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMID the soft-mouthed apologists for structural adjustment policies - who concede that its conditionalities may be &quot;too harsh&quot; or its social safety nets &quot;too loose&quot; - economist Michel Chossudowski is refreshingly blunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failures of structural adjustment, he contends, have been masked by &quot; the systematic falsification of the database&quot;. And if such policies are not contested and defeated, &quot;the alternative is Bosnia&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chossudowski was in Johannesburg this week to address a meeting of the Campaign against Neoliberalism in South Africa (Cansa). He is professor of economics at Ottawa University, and is best-known as the author of a number of studies into the negative impact of adjustment policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His latest book - a collection of a dozen case-studies including Rwanda and Eastern Europe, called The Globalisation of Poverty - is hot off the press.  And while he was speaking, World Bank president James Wolfensohn was preparing to jet into South Africa to preach the benefits of adjustment and the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mathematical economist by training, Chossudowski has visited more than 100 countries and conducted data-led adjustment studies in 20 places over the past two decades. His case against adjustment is that rather than recovery, it triggers &quot;the destruction of whole economies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By devaluing currencies to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recipe, governments spark increases in prices and real interest rates. As inflation mounts, wages are de-indexed and real wage rates compressed. The value of the state budget falls and social services are slashed. A country's manufacturers face rising fuel prices and freight costs, which exclude them from their own markets at the same time as trade barriers are lifted to allow in a flood of dumped goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiscal systems collapse, comparative advantage is destroyed and national sovereignty abandoned as creditors take over policy formation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's essentially not a liberal but a highly interventionist policy framework,&quot; he says, &quot;creating neo-colonial government of a new type.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chossudowski's analysis, with its emphasis on economic recovery through investment rather than deficit control, challenges much of the basis of South Africa's growth, employment and redistribution (Gear) strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to ask whether Gear and reconstruction are compatible. When one emphasises minimising costs and the other requires expansion to create jobs, it would appear they are not ... However, change would require redefining the role of private creditors and democratising decision-making in the central bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, as several members of the Cansa audience pointed out, is a political, as well as an economic project. But Chossudowski believes that resistance to the global rockfall of adjustment is possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governments can say no. India managed to stay free of World Bank intrusion until 1991. One crucial factor is the relation between the state and civil society. Are governments more concerned to serve their creditors than to serve the people? Another factor is how self-reliant your domestic economy is.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike many at the meeting, Chossudowski sees the World Bank and the IMF not as demons but as mere apparatchiks of the world financial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The commercial and merchant banks, the trading companies, are the beneficiaries of adjustment policies. They are expanding their scope by displacing existing productive systems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many things about South Africa surprise him, including - given the country's history of struggle - that the struggle against the international financial institutions is comparatively new. And some things shock, like public acquiescence in the creation of what he terms &quot;new homelands&quot; in Mozambique for white, right- wing business interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it was designed to buy off right-wing resistance, it seems a very short- term strategy. What you have allowed them to do is establish their own bases on your borders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what shocks Chossudowski most is the government's emphasis on debt repayment. &quot;Apartheid debt was borrowed to oppress and kill people. Now those same people are being asked to sacrifice to pay it back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE government has revised expenditure in the 1996/97 Budget by R3,4- billion to R176,5-billion and is confident that it will still achieve a deficit of 5,1%, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This represents 31,4% of the expected aggregate gross domestic product (GDP)of R560-billion for the 1996/97 year and is an increase of 15% over the 1995/96 expenditure level of R153-billion,&quot; he told Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based on revenue receipts for the first nine months of the year, it is now estimated that revenue during 1996/97 will amount to R147,4-billion, which is an increase of R2,5-billion over the March 1996 estimate,&quot; Manuel said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Budget deficit is expected to amount to R28,7-billion, or 5,1% of GDP, as planned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the Adjustments Appropriations Bill as &quot;the test for plan versus performance on fiscal management over the period of 12 months with the benefit of hindsight&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The adjustment estimates provide for appropriations amounting to R13,1- billion. This is made up of R205,7-million anticipated at the time the Budget was announced last March; R523,7-million in externally funded expenditure; R535,7- million for function shifts between votes; R2,9-billion for unforeseen and unavoidable expenditure by departments and rollovers of R8,9- billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main Budget and the adjustment estimates provide for appropriations totalling just more than R190-billion, but R4,1-billion of this was counted twice for Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Department Director General Hannes Smit said departments had saved R484,7- million, which maintained the trend set in previous years to encourage departments to save where possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is a target set and we have vigorously pursued it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at the overall expenditure, I think that we are maintaining the position of last year. I do not think there is a big improvement but I don't think there is a deterioration either,&quot; Smit said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the increased expenditure, R523,7- million was externally funded and used for closing down agricultural parastatals in the former Transkei and cleaning up oil pollution off the east coast. A further R205,7-million had already been set aside for unblocking the criminal justice system and the establishment of the new South African Revenue Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unforeseen and unavoidable over-expenditure totalled R2,6-billion and included R295- million in standing appropriations, including an unexpected R252,7-million for loan guarantee liabilities for marginal mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government departments' over-expenditure totalled R2,4-billion, with the biggest slice of R1,4-billion going to the Department of Finance itself for transfers to provinces. The police service overspent R604-million, mainly because of the rationalisation of police services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC received an unscheduled R177,4- million for services such as the upgrading of African language stations (R50,8- million), provincial programming (R48,7- million), education (R7,1-million), increased local content (R40,4-million), truth commission coverage (R4,8-million), parliamentary coverage (R3,6-million), coverage of all religious faiths (R21, 1- million) and public interest programmes (R900 000).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government also had to cover Post Office losses of R213,3-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smit said some national and provincial departments had performed well while others had not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The one big improvement, and I think we will only see the fruit of that in 1997/98, is that we hope to complete by March 31 to have all salaries on the Persel system so that we can look at personnel expenditure at least from actual figures rather than from figures produced by departments,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The computerised salary system would ensure that state expenditure would know exactly who was on the payroll. It has been widely alleged that the public service payroll has been inflated by a large number of &quot;ghost&quot; employees who do not exist but still draw salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, rollovers and double accounting because of transfers from RDP funds had confused the accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Luckily, this is the last year that we will deal with RDP accounts,&quot; Smit said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was because the last of the funds would be transferred from the Department of Finance to the RDP fund, and then from the RDP fund to the relevant departments through the exchequer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smit said that of the R12-billion not spent in 1995/96, only R8,9-billion had been allowed to roll over into 1996/97.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rollovers have been steadily increasing in recent years in preparation for multi-year budgeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smit said rollovers had been used to assist departments to work over more than one year. The introduction of the multi-year budgeting system would make it much easier to plan. The problem with a one-year system was that it was difficult for departments to plan ahead, Smit said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, departments had started spending in the middle of February to the end of March merely to use up their budgets. Rollovers had prevented this last- minute spending on things that were not always immediately necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the deficit had been calculated without taking rollovers into account but admitted that &quot;we have had quite a substantial saving on expenditure because of the rollovers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Director General Maria Ramos said that the shift to multi-year budgeting would lead to a &quot;substantial improvement. It is virtually impossible, particularly on capital expenditure, to budget in year one and spend everything. There is preparation time, project preparation and project implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of these projects take two, three, five years to develop and be completed and the notion that you have to budget all that in year one is nonsensical. It also does not allow you to get a close enough correlation between policy and expenditure. Moving towards the multi-year budgeting system will help us do that because it will be supported by a whole range of other instruments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first instalment of multi-year budgeting would be introduced in 1998/99.  It would take that long because systems would have to be put in place to shift fully to multi-year budgeting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As Western consumers move toward natural foods, organic farming in South Africa is confined to small-scale believers and subsistence farmers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Michael Mount Organic Market in Bryanston, Gauteng, features immaculate wooden stalls stocked with nature's elixirs and healing stones, the soothing sounds of an acoustic guitar wafting over piles of purple aubergines and wholewheat vegetable pies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But more apparent than the peace-and-love atmosphere is the sense of white affluence. If it weren't for the heat, you might be forgiven for thinking that you had stepped into a European village market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps this isn't particularly surprising if you consider two things: firstly, organic produce is notably more expensive (about 50% more) than that in your average supermarket; and secondly, the concept of &quot;organic farming&quot; has been imported from Europe and Australia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the basics of organic farming are practised by other communities - all over the country black subsistence farmers still raise crops in the ways of the ancestors, working their fields by hand and relying on the natural ingredients of the soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Organic&quot; farming is essentially what humans have been doing since antiquity, say Robin de Lorm and Terry Hagen, whose farm &quot;Green Piece&quot; in the Hennops River Valley has been going since 1989. It's working within the rhythms and order of nature to produce food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They point out that this is a back-to- basics attitude, a reaction to the &quot; Green Revolution&quot; of the 1930s, which ironically marked the beginning of chemical use in farming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organic farmers in South Africa tend to choose one of three methods to raise their crops and livestock, including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Permaculture, started in Australia by Bill Mollison and David Holgren, emphasises the connections between all elements within the farm's ecological system. Avice Hindmarch, a Gauteng-based farmer, explains that a thorough knowledge of &quot;symbiotic links and connections&quot; allows the farmer to manage pests and increase soil fertility without using outside materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In practical terms, this means practices like &quot;companion planting&quot;, where compatible plants are placed nearby each other as a natural way to control pests and their predators; and mixed farming, which includes animals and plant life in an integrated, balanced system. Ultimately, the farmer &quot;designs a system which then manages itself&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One particularly valuable aspect of Permaculture is the emphasis on conserving water. Rain water that falls on the ground is directed deep into the soil to strengthen underwater springs, while rain that falls on to various farm structures is collected and stored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Biodynamics, the brainchild of philosopher Rudolf Steiner, takes the concept of &quot;interconnectedness&quot; a step further. Pieter Gernaat, a member of the Biodynamic Agricultural Association of South Africa, explains that the &quot; forming forces from the sky&quot; are as important as the &quot;creative forces of the land&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This kind of farming strives to use these &quot;life-forces&quot; as optimally as possible. For example, when the moon is in a water constellation, it is a &quot; leaf&quot; day, meaning it's a good time to plant vegetables like lettuce and cabbage. Says Gernaat: &quot;What it boils down to is it is not unimportant in what phase of Mars you plant an oak tree&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Organic can be broadly used to describe farmers who do not spray their crops with &quot;poisons&quot; or use artificial fertilisers. A key to this is the use of organic waste to create compost, which neutralises unwanted hormones or chemical residues and builds the fertility of the soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, organic farmers in South Africa have not been a unified movement.  An initiative in 1995 to establish an Organic Agricultural Association of South Africa (OAASA) collapsed due to internal politics and a general lack of commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also a lack of a cohesive infrastructure: organic farmers receive &quot; not a sausage&quot; (as Hagen puts it) in subsidies from the government, and there is no such thing as a South African organic certificate, or the practice of widespread testing, to make sure certain standards can be guaranteed to the consumer. Farmers who do certify their produce, which is imperative if they are going to export to places like Europe, do so at their own expense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further inhibiting factor is the absence of &quot;educated consumers&quot; conscientised to the benefits of organic methods. At present, organic farmers supply only upmarket greengrocers, or elite supermarkets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements (IFOAM), which represents small-scale organic farmers in 92 countries, is starting a project in South Africa that could mobilise the locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFOAM, represented by Hindmarch in South Africa, intends to conduct a survey of both conventional and organic farms to see &quot;how man can farm, feed himself and supply food, not at the expense of the environment&quot;, and secondly &quot;to see what needs to be done in order to improve the systems&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the basics of farming organically are shared by farmers at the other end of the spectrum - &quot;peasant&quot; farmers, located in rural areas, continue to use what are essentially traditional methods of farming. Their persistence in using these methods is perhaps less to do with principle, than with poverty: they simply can't afford the chemicals that mainstream farmers use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These small-scale organic farmers are attracting the attention of foreign agents, who buy up their produce, sort and pack it themselves, and then export it to organic- hungry markets such as Europe. A French- Canadian, Robert Tritz, has become involved with indigenous farmers in KwaZulu-Natal who have been growing sugarcane organically for many years. Tritz managed to secure the use of a small, abandoned sugar mill, and putting two and two together, came up with the successful enterprise of exporting the organic sugar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hindmarch points out that &quot;there is an enormous resource of small producers&quot; which has not been locally explored. If a collecting and marketing system could be developed, and &quot;organic&quot; popularised locally, the benefits to the farmers could be enormous. However, she believes that it is an opportunity that the farmers themselves need to own: the use of a middle-man makes the small-scale indigenous farmers vulnerable to exploitation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The bizarre life of the man who bombed ANC headquarters in London, and who was crushed to death last week, is recounted by Phillip van Niekerk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN a spy dies, one is left guessing what knowledge he has taken to the grave with him. Peter Casselton, London spymaster of the apartheid government, resident of Vlakplaas, confidant of the likes of Craig Williamson and Eugene de Kock, died last week and now will never be heard at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perusing the notebooks of the hours I spent with him I am not sure, at the end of the day, whether he would have helped solve any great mysteries. But he did have a story to tell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a year ago Casselton contacted me, through self-confessed hit- squad killer and journalist's friend Dirk Coetzee, with one intention: to reveal the dirt on his long-time associate Craig Williamson, whom he believed had swindled him out of a small fortune.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Peter Casselton I met was haunted by failure. Once he had been a blue- eyed young pilot and warrior for Ian Smith's thousand- year Reich who in the promise of his youth had married a former beauty queen from Rhodesia. He once sailed the Mediterranean in his own yacht and had an unlimited expense account paid for by the South African taxpayer. His friends were powerful and untouchable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time I got to know him, his cherubic face had gone florid from hard living and quantities of booze consumed at Pretoria's drinking taverns where the detritus of apartheid's wars hang out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When South African agents bombed the African National Congress's headquarters in Penton Street, London, in 1982, Casselton was the only team member not to receive the Police Star for Outstanding Service that the wise- cracking minister of law and order, Louis le Grange, bestowed on Eugene De Kock, Williamson, Vic McPherson and four others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the agent in the field they didn't want to blow Casselton's cover.  However, he was caught burgling the offices of the ANC and Swapo and spent two years and eight months in tjoekie in Britain where he was regularly beaten to a pulp by black fellow- prisoners delighted to discover a representative of the apartheid regime in their midst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casselton was physically tough. Despite being given the third degree by the anti- terrorist squad at Scotland Yard, he held his tongue and never disclosed the identity of the bombers until Williamson himself spoke out in early 1995, 13 years after the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was part of the reason for Casselton's bitterness towards Williamson and his desire to tell me the &quot;whole story&quot; that began to pour out during Sunday morning breakfast sessions at the Wimpy in the Quagga Centre in Pretoria West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told me of Swiss bank accounts set up with millions stolen from the ANC, of a business partnership with the notorious drug dealer El Hajj, of the ivory trade and collusion with the Mozambican security police to ship the Burundi stockpile from Beira. And then there were the swindles. Always the swindles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was impossible to tell which tales were planted to get Williamson, where fantasy began or ended. Yet I was intrigued and hoped that a real nugget would be unearthed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casselton's hostility towards Williamson began when he was released from prison to find he had lost his pilot's licence, he was blown as an agent and he believed that Williamson had plundered his money. He and Williamson had created a business, Beach Port, in the Channel Islands and purchased a yacht.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They named it The Two Lisas in memory of Williamson's sister, Lisa, a lecturer at the spy school, and Casselton's beloved poodle, also Lisa, who died together in a motor accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Casselton tried to sell the yacht to a South African businessman after his release from prison, a check through the books and a visit to St Heliers revealed that the company had become a conduit for all sorts of nefarious activities, and was under surveillance by various authorities. Casselton never got a cent from his investment, which was a lifetime of savings from crop-spraying and dodgy operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casselton's first problem was that the stories that he knew the most about implicated himself. Being a pilot he had first hand knowledge of drug and ivory smuggling and illicit supplies to Unita and Renamo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He confessed that only months before he had transported a load of contraband whiskey and a box of rhino horn by yacht to a beach on the Mozambican coast. From there, he had personally delivered the horn to the embassy of the People's Republic of China in Maputo, or so he claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the purchase of a leather- seated Cessna that was based in Nairobi to fly quantities of the drug mira to the Somali fighters at Kismaya.  That scheme ended when the plane got lost in the Ogaden desert and a former South African Air force pilot, a man described as being driven more by his dick than good sense, absconded with female company and the keys to the plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stories of intrigue and recruitment in London would have made interesting material for the truth commission. Casselton claimed that he had put an ANC cabinet minister through university at Oxford and that he handled apartheid's snitches in London and Holland. One was a Dutch policeman, a former bodyguard to Prince Bernhard, who retired to Johannesburg to start a dog grooming parlour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once Casselton broke into a London art gallery to test its burglar alarm system - it was identical to the make used in the ANC offices. It was probably the first time that he found himself inside an art gallery, but he knew what he liked. He nicked a magnificent painting of a South African racehorse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was shipped to South Africa and presented as a gift to the then police commissioner. It was placed in a prominent place in the commissioner's lounge where it became one of the best in-jokes in the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his fall, Casselton was always coming up with new and unsuccessful schemes to make money - he tried to buy Russian helicopters as scrap from the Mozambican air force and repair them to sell to a theme park in Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He once told me he was looking into participating in a scam to marry Russian women, bring them to South Africa to work as prostitutes and live off the commission. Before he could participate, he asked me to use my contacts to find out if he was still married in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in prison during the eighties, he explained, he had married Claire, &quot; just a bird I knew from the pub&quot;, at the Wandsworth prison registry office to bolster his parole application. She drove off with the Mercedes 450 bought with secret funds and he never saw her again. All he knew was that her father was an artist who lived in Kent and painted equestrian portraits for the Queen Mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was reason to despise Casselton. The way he bragged about his intelligence role in the Chimoio massacre by the Rhodesian security forces in 1976 in which hundreds of refugees, including women and children, were slaughtered, was enough to book his place in hell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet, strangely, there was a softness to the man. Long after the hard men of Vlakplaas had abandoned De Kock to enlist as state witnesses, Casselton would buy meat and cook it for him every Sunday in the kitchen of the Brass Inn, driven by a touching loyalty and admiration for Prime Evil and concern that someone might want to poison him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock's only other regular visitors were an elderly aunt from the East Rand and a black Angolan comrade in arms from Koevoet who had named his son Eugene. One Sunday the Angolan came to the prison and presented De Kock with a pen and pencil set and a bible inscribed with the words &quot;the Lord will decide what is right and what is not&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This advice did not prevent him from travelling to northern Mozambique to search earnestly for a magical beetle that would grant De Kock the power to get out of prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casselton also remained loyal to the widows and orphans of the apartheid system long after they had been abandoned to their fate by the National Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tried to secure financial compensation for the widow of Frakkie Zihamba, Malawi's first Boeing pilot, an agent for the South African security police who was tortured to death in Banda's prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no doubt that Casselton was a racist, but he hated Afrikaners even more than blacks. And some of his closest associates were De Kock's former black troops with whom he had lived at Vlakplaas and Daisy Farm. He was trusted by these Bakongo veterans - ex-FNLA, ex-Koevoet, ex- Vlakplaas, ex-Executive Outcomes - living in a tight suspicious circle at Lethlabile, loyal only to Eugene de Kock and Holden Roberto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sense they were kindred spirits. The evil that accompanied white rule has passed with defeat into history, but the individuals, white and black, who were corrupted by it are fated to live out their days like misfits, beached whales on the shore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tom Stoppard's Rosencratz and Guildenstern Are Dead, a play on the existential meaninglessness of the lives of the two minor characters sent to spy on Hamlet, Guildenstern says: &quot;We cross our bridges when we come to them and burn them behind us, with nothing to show for our progress except a memory of the smell of smoke, and a presumption that once our eyes watered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the wars were lost, the emptiness was so deep that Casselton's closest relationship was with a miniature black poodle called Poepas who went everywhere with him. After a bar brawl with a group of Afrikaners last year, Poepas was abducted and a poodlehunt through Pretoria by old mates still in uniform proved fruitless. It almost broke his heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that he broke down one morning, almost crying: &quot;Look I am over 50. I have nothing. Nothing.&quot; He had no property, no fixed abode, and was reduced to living off the charity of a dwindling group of drinking buddies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He died last week after being squashed against the wall by a truck he was working on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fate appeared in the garb of liquor rather than assassination, but they were both milestones on the road to nowhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There must have been a moment at the beginning,&quot; says Guildenstern to Rosencrantz, awaiting their predestined death at the end of the play, &quot;where we all could have said - no. But somehow we missed it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The OJ Simpson trials serve as warnings of the problems South Africa could face should it decide to reintroduce the jury system</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE recent verdict in the United States holding OJ Simpson liable in damages to the family of a man he was said to have murdered, highlights a number of difficulties in the administration of justice, not the least of which, especially to South African observers, is that of the continued serviceability of the jury system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The criminal court jury, largely black, acquitted Simpson of murder, and the white civil court jury found him liable for damages. A starker example of racial decision-making is hard to imagine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because South Africa's Bench, at all levels, is not representative of its people, there are periodic calls to remedy this imbalance by the introduction of a jury system, whereby eight (or 12, or however many) ordinary citizens, chosen at random and therefore representative, sit in judgment on their peers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial by jury has a special place in England and the US: in 1758 the great commentator, Sir William Blackstone, described it as &quot;the glory of the English Law&quot; and it is enshrined in two articles of the US Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In ancient times, juries often refused to convict persons deemed by the authorities to be seditious troublemakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurymen refused, for example, to find two Quakers guilty of unlawful assembly when, on the facts, they must have been. A furious judge sent them back to reconsider their verdict, depriving them of all food and ablution facilities for the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they didn't budge, he fined them a huge amount of money and imprisoned them. Higher courts intervened, however, and their verdict was upheld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, six bishops were acquitted by a jury in 1688 after being brought to trial for challenging the authority of the King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the high-profile cases, but it was a common complaint of the landed gentry, when prosecuting poachers, that the juries found &quot;contrary to the evidence&quot;. And no less an authority than the social historian, EP Thompson, saw juries in the early 18th century as providing &quot;a salutary check to the growth of arbitrary power&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus the reason the jury system has such an emotional attraction in these countries is its role in winning rights for ordinary citizens, even when, on occasion, they did so by ignoring either the evidence, or the law, or the judges' directions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no similar history in South Africa. In the first place, the British Colonial power knew instinctively the dangers of the jury system and avoided it. Early political trials in South Africa often had Boer dissidents as the accused and they were tried by judges rather than by a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As John Dugard noted in his superb book, Human Rights and the South African Legal Order, the &quot;jury trial was not a success in South Africa largely on account of the heterogenous nature of the society&quot;; thus it was the prospect of a Boer jury that prompted Sir Leander Starr Jameson's marauders to take their chance before a single Transvaal Judge, Gregorowski (even though he had signalled his intentions well before the trial started by setting out to borrow the traditional black cap worn by judges when they pronounced the death sentence).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juries were, in any case, drawn from the voters' roll and this meant that in any case where a black person was accused, he was judged by an all-white jury. The traditional purpose of the jury system was thus eliminated by the racial nature of South Africa's political system, and it was no wonder that in 1969 it was abolished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is far too soon to consider its reintroduction. The Simpson verdict may be a rarity in the US, but it must nevertheless serve as a warning of the dangers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, race is still too dominant a factor in ordinary peoples' lives for their prejudices not to intrude into their decisions: it is not realistic to expect a white jury in Sandton to fairly weigh the evidence against a black hijacker, or a black jury in Carletonville to objectively assess the evidence of a mine's negligence regarding a fatal accident underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is some comfort in the system of assessors, who can be drawn from the wider community to assist a judge, and this undoubtedly can go a long way towards redressing the lack of representivity of the Bench.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Wear shades, the future's so bright</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A South African man with a dream of a bright future is about as scarce as a politician driving a VW nowadays. Or so we thought, until someone showed us a speech made by the rector and vice-chancellor of the University of Zululand, Professor CRM Dlamini. What a oke!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says: &quot;I have a dream and a vision that the University of Zululand shall be the university of the future. A university of the future has to be financially viable and strong. A few years ago I said we need to raise an endowment fund for the university. It shall be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is my dream that this endowment fund should be the biggest of all the universities in this country. While others will be struggling, and even collapsing, it shall stand firm and unshakable. It shall indeed be the university of the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever politicians may think, whatever cynics may plot, this is the university of the future. Wise men and women shall come to see this dream come true. They shall marvel at the ugly duckling that has blossomed into a huge and attractive duck ... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This man is not swanning around, that's for sure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spooky stories</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Any of you ouens who've been in the Dorsbult Bar know that it's the lekkerste place in the whole country to have a beer and feel very, very satisfied. Right? So you won't believe the top secret report sent to the Dorsbult by a journalist who claimed he found a better bar this week. In the visdorpie nogal. Read this and, like Dennis says, you be the judge:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Spies exposed their home base to media scrutiny this week. They had a cocktail party in their own private bar (address deleted).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems the media misread South Africa's intelligence service. They must have spent the last 20 years on the beaches, collecting driftwood and flotsam and jetsam for their bar. There is a collection of old teaspoons and broken crockery and a large selection of nautical headgear on the walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To crown it all, the actual bar was in an old fishing boat they bought on the West Coast for R1 and put together in the Suidooster Bar. There was a sprinkling of mermaids, approximately 25 to each spy present, and a lot of booze and food was left over after the function.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they want to take us on? Did you read the part about how they hardly drank anything? The Suidooster can blast as hard as it wants, but the Dorsbult is still standing strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Parliament this week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Welcome back, members of parliament. This column was getting a bit droog without stories from the house. To show how non- sexist the Dorsbult Bar gallery really is, we'll start off with what our female elected leaders got up to in the first week of the 1997 session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ad-hoc Committee on the Status of Women had a briefing this week on the steps taken by the government to improve the plight of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Minister of Justice Mandla Shabalala's input was so gripping that the National Party's Sheila Camerer spent almost the entire time fixing her lipstick and her hair. Mooi so, Sheila!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Last week we reported on links between senior women in the African National Congress and a privately run deportation centre contracted to the Home Affairs Ministry. On Tuesday the ANC reacted with a statement defending the &quot;rights&quot; of its members to &quot;seek a stake in the mainstream of the economy of our country&quot;. On Wednesday we received an indignant letter from lawyers representing the ANC women concerned, describing any suggestion that they had benefited financially as &quot;devoid of any truth&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The episode underlines the worrying confusion of the ANC where ethical considerations are concerned. Technically the ANC is right in saying its members are free to engage in economic activity. But, no matter what assurances they give as to their worthy motives, there is obviously a potential conflict of interest if they are involved in a commercial transaction with a government of which they are members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They open themselves to further criticism when they engage in activities which stand to benefit from the misfortunes of others stemming from government policy. Clearly, the lawyers recognised this point; unfortunately, their clients' organisation does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similarly worrying statement of principle was displayed by President Nelson Mandela this week with his remark that the opinions of countries which had bankrolled the liberation struggle had to be taken into account when deciding with which countries South Africa would establish diplomatic relations. There has been much rumour about countries which bankrolled the ANC, and speculation as to the possible linkage between such funding and foreign policy. The suggestion that the ANC puts party above country is given weight by the president's comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Parliament introduced a register of MPs' interests. It is now time there was a similar declaration of parties' interests with regard to foreign funding. Maybe it is worth introducing a course in civics for politicians --- as long as the contract does not go to prominent members of the ANC anxious to assert their right to &quot;seek a stake in the mainstream of the economy&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - &quot;Speak not ill of the dead&quot; is a maxim which has long been honoured more in the breach. Those who would attribute lack of respect for the dead to modern fashion --- the cowardice of the tabloids (the threat of libel action having been consigned to the worms), or the trend towards &quot; obitchery&quot; --- might contemplate an editorial published by the Cape Times in 1929 to mark the passing of mining magnate Sir Joseph Robinson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The voice of his contemporaries is perforce silent about the evil which his long and unredeemed career compelled them, without known exception, to think of him,&quot; it said. The editorial warned &quot;those who in the future may acquire great wealth in this country, lest their memories should come within possible risk of rivalling the loathsomeness of the thing that is the memory of Sir Joseph Robinson&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the principle is rarely honoured there must be many who will have been taken aback by the less than respectful remembrance of Joe Slovo offered up to the mass market by his daughter, Gillian Slovo --- disclosing, among other things, the existence of a Slovo &quot;love child&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to fathom her motivation in publicly washing what some might describe as her father's dirty laundry. Revenge, for his lack of attention? A group therapy session, with an audience in the tens of thousands guaranteed by being plastered across the Sunday newspapers? Or, as a budding writer, did she simply regard her father's life as part of her inheritance, open to being mined for financial advantage? Perhaps she merely sought to benefit society with an idealistic exercise in the sort of transparency guaranteed by the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explanation for her exercise in baring her father's soul probably lies in a combination of such factors. The human psyche is glorious in its complexity --- a point which needs be borne in mind in judging Joe Slovo, as well as his daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the face of it there is something cruelly dispassionate in a father refusing to acknowledge his child. At the same time it is possible to sympathise with the attempts of two adult men --- including Judge Albie Sachs, who after all did knowingly accept the child as his own --- to determine a course which they regarded as being logically the best for the boy and their respective families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Gillian Slovo's account of her father's determination not to abandon that course of action ---&quot;I'm not going to tell you anything,&quot; he snapped &quot; with venom&quot; --- there is something familiar to the life and times of the South African Communist Party leader. Reading the weekend papers, it was not difficult to imagine a ghost in red socks peering over one's shoulder and murmuring with a resigned shrug: &quot;So much for dialectical materialism...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - SWEET-TOOTHED elephants are going to have a field day if a sugar plantation gets under way in northern Botswana, in what conservationists call one of the most environmentally unfriendly schemes imaginable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sugar plantation is reportedly to be built on the sand bridge behind the Chobe River and inside the Kasane Forest Reserve which is full of protected indigenous trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I first heard about this on the grapevine I dismissed it as rambling,&quot; says Jonathan Gibson of Chobe Game Lodge. &quot;Personally I can't believe it's viable. Think of the energy needed ... the idea is preposterous.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dennis van Eysen, a mobile safari operator in Kasane, says he drove a group of men, including an engineer and a representative of Hulletts sugar in South Africa, to the sand ridge on July 23 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I took them round the area proposed for the plantation and they took soil samples and talked about sugar cane,&quot; said Van Eysen. I overheard one saying, 'Don't worry about the greenies, we'll buy them off.' At the time I thought it was just a thumb suck, now it seems to have gathered momentum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics believe the project was initially turned down by the departments of forestry and agricultural but has now been verbally approved by the office of the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man behind the plan, businessman Dave Griffiths, says: &quot;At this stage it's very speculative. We're talking four or five years away. We're doing a feasibility study and if that looks okay them we'll do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the plantation and mill will employ 4 000 people, and would be built on both the Namibian and Botswana side ot the river. &quot;It will be the single largest investment in the country, bigger even than the diamond mine at Orapa,&quot; says Griffiths. &quot;We're going to build a whole new town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the impact on the environment, he says that's the biggest part of the feasibility study and will include the views of all relevant non governmental organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Griffiths, the World Bank is interested in the scheme and Angola and Zambia may be involved as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he insist it is premature to discuss anything in detail at the moment. Griffiths claims the department of agriculture has given him full blessing and will take a decision on the project next year. But government sources in Kasane say the proposal was rejected. They also say the site for the sugar plantation is earmarked for further village deveopment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Griffiths says the feasibility study will be done by September, and he's due to fly to Namibia later this month to meet American consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Chobe Wildlife Trust says the whole idea is outrageous. Trust president Pat Carr-Hartley says the plantation would have to be fenced,which would restrict wildlife getting to the river, and &quot;elephants would be there like green lighning&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says a fence would mainly affect elephant and buffalo which would be restricted to foraging in the nearby Chobe National Park. This in turn would put more pressure on the park, at a time when the trust wants the animals more widely distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a completely harebrained idea,&quot; says Carr-Hartley. &quot;Botswana has few forest areas and we must keep what we have, these are indigenous trees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the plantation would have a disastrous impact on the environment, and fears that sweet-toothed elephants who venture in would be shot. - Okavango Observer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carr-Hartley adds that taking water from the Chobe would have the same impact as Namibia's plan to draw water from the Okavango, and everyone downriver will complain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Kashweeka, co-ordinator of the Forum on Sustainable Agriculture (Fonsac) is also concerned. &quot;I overheard people talking about the possibility of a sugar plantation right next to my home in Kasane,&quot; he says. &quot;I phoned a few people to check and no one seems to know how far the proposal has gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm telling you, that's near my place and that's the corridor the animals use to go to the stream, or if the stream is low then they use it to get to the Chobe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says any such project should learn from the disastrous experience of the Pandamatenga farms. Set up about six years ago, the idea was to increase food production in the area. But the scheme was a failure, environmental problems weren't considered, and &quot;now there are large scars on the land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Kashweeka says sugar cane needs a lot of fertilizers. The site is near to a stream which feeds into the Zambezi, and chemicals could be washed into the soil and then into the river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where's the water source going to be?&quot; asks Kashweeka. &quot;Every day you see the level of the Chobe River going down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - NEARLY six months after proposing with great fanfare to create an all-African military force to intervene in trouble spots, a chastened Clinton administration has revised the plan to meet African demands for more decision-making power and overcome French resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since President Bill Clinton approved the original plan several crises have erupted in Africa - in Zaire, in Sudan and in the Central African Republic - but any US- sponsored force is still many months away from deployment, according to administration officials and European and African diplomats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed Africa Crisis Response Force, or ACRF, &quot;is alive and moving, very much so&quot;, one senior official said, but &quot;our original timetable was overly aggressive&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That timetable called for up to 10 000 African troops to be designated, trained, equipped and prepared for deployment well before the end of this year. So far, however, only two countries have designated military units for potential participation and training has not yet begun, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mali and Ethiopia declared their willingness to participate when then- Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited Africa in October. According to administration officials and foreign diplomats, many other African countries have endorsed the concept in principle, and several European allies have agreed to support it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the original US plan, hastily devised in anticipation of an explosion of violence in Burundi that has so far not occurred, failed to take into account African sensitivities about decisions made by outsiders, several sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fledgling regional groups within Africa, such as the 12-member Southern Africa Development Committee, wanted an official voice in deciding when and where an intervention force might be needed, who should be in it and what its assignment should be, and the US is prepared to accommodate them, several sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such an arrangement would move the US vision of the force closer to that of France, which has been reluctant to support what it sees as an effort to muscle in on what has traditionally been a French zone of influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We ourselves would like to have further consultations with our members before we announce our ideas about it,&quot; said Ahmed Haggag, deputy secretary general of the Organization of African Unity. &quot;Sub-groups such as the SADC have their own blueprints about conflict resolution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A UNITED NATIONS report says the international Rwanda genocide trials have been crippled by chaotic management, underqualified legal staff and indifference at UN headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN inspector general, Karl Paschke, said that unless there is an overhaul of what he described as the most important trials since Nuremburg, the Rwandan people &quot;will be right to suspect that justice delayed is justice denied&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was nearly three years after the launch of the 1994 genocide of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis before the first alleged killer went on trial in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the tribunal has 13 of the 21 people it has so far indicted in custody, only one of them is a highly placed official in the Hutu extremist regime which organised the slaughter. All the cabinet ministers of the deposed government remain free and, so far, unindicted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his report on the tribunal, Paschke concluded that &quot;not a single administrative area (of the court) functioned effectively&quot; amid &quot; mismanagement in almost all areas of the tribunal and frequent violations of UN rules and regulations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report singled out the tribunal's Kenyan administrator for criticism.  It also accused its deputy prosecutor, a judge from Madagascar, of incompetence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other things the report noted was that the administrator, Andronico Adede, spent half his time travelling without having his trips approved by anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he was away administrative work often ground to a halt. Tribunal investigators' phones in Rwanda were cut four times last year because the administration failed to pay the bills on time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy prosecutor, Honore Rakotomanana, failed to coordinate investigations, leaving lawyers and detectives to pursue their inquiries haphazardly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men face the possibility of dismissal when their contracts expire next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN inquiry was launched two months ago amid allegations that the tribunal's African administrators hired unqualified friends and lovers, discriminated against non-Africans and paralysed the tribunal with incompetence and bureaucracy. But while Paschke found there had been gross mismanagement he did not find evidence of corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief prosecutor, Canadian judge Louise Arbour, who has overall responsibility for the tribunal, welcomed the report as a turning point. She said she will fly to Rwanda and the court in Tanzania next week to meet the officials most criticised by the report but declined to discuss the possibility of their dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The report will have a positive effect in dispelling the most outrageous allegations such as allegations of gross sexual misconduct, or rampant nepotism or corruption. Having said that, it's fair to say the report exposed extremely serious mismanagement, with departments being particularly deficient by leaving the Rwanda tribunal to struggle along on its own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others, including the Rwandan government, say that ultimate responsibility for the tribunal's shortcomings can be traced back to the UN Security Council decision to divide responsibility between the prosecutor at Tiu Hague, the investigators in Rwanda and the court in Tanzania -beside leaving many crucial appointments to the UN in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others point the finger at Judge Arbour's predecessor, the South African judge Richard Goldstone. Critics, such as the Rwandan deputy justice minister Gerald Gahima, say Judge Goldstone was never really interested in the Rwanda court and that he was using it as a stepping stone to ensuring his name figured prominently in the creation of a permanent international war crimes tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rwanda is peripheral to the prosecution's work. Goldstone only used to come here for a few days to meet the president and vice president. The tribunal cannot be effective until Rwanda has its own prosecutor,&quot; Gahima said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the UN released its report the tribunal administrator and deputy prosecutor were under fire from their own staff and through leaks to the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racially charged accusations of nepotism and discrimination against non- Africans cut particularly deep. Judge Rakotomanana fired back that fewer than half of his 92 staff members are Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are always some people who are unhappy. I fear those who might try to create divisions between Africa and the rest of the world are wrong, and what they are doing is creating destabilisation which undermines the work of the tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first victim will be Rwanda itself, and then the international community. If justice does not go forward, then the massacres will not have been accounted for,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the causes, divisions inside the tribunal run deep and not solely on racial lines. Women in senior positions complain of rampant sexism.  Differences have also arisen between the lawyers, who made up the bulk of the initial investigators, and the policeman who are now in the majority.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - ZIMBABWE's human rights record has taken a hammering with a United States official report detailing violations ranging from police brutality to interference in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US State Department's 1996 Country Report on Zimbabwe criticises the Harare government for failing to pursue past allegations of torture and refusing to prosecute police and intelligence officers responsible for such abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It cites the refusal of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) to pay court-ordered damages to a 1990 torture victim belonging to an opposition party, noting that the attorney general's office was unable to ensure CIO compliance with the judgment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report refers to appeals from the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP) for an inquiry into the fate of victims of the army's North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade which conducted counter- insurgency operations in Matabeleland in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite calls by the CCJP for an investigation, the government took no action on the bodies discovered at Antelope Mine in Kezi in 1992; the bodies have not been identified or properly buried,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Examples of police brutality documented include police firing teargas at striking nurses who were peaceably entering a magistrate's court in November to hear a case against fellow strikers and the beating the same month of students fleeing disturbances at the University of Zimbabwe campus. Referring to recent elections, the report observes there were &quot;credible reports of continued CIO harassment of independent and opposition candidates and their supporters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political process continued to be tilted in favour of the ruling Zanu- PF party, the report says although it also ascribes the opposition's poor showing to weak leadership, infighting, and lack of coherent platforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says the government influenced the mainstream media through indirect ownership, editorial appointments, directives to editors, and removal of wayward editors. Despite a supreme court ruling that the government's monopoly of communications was unconstitutional, the government had repeatedly refused to license independent radio and television stations, the report notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the independent press was increasingly open and critical of the government, there was a measure of self- censorship aggravated by strict anti- defamation laws that made no distinction between private and public persons, the report says, mentioning the award of substantial damages to the former head of the army beacuse an independent monthly had pondered how his &quot;goings on&quot; would be reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While citizens had a constitutional right to privacy, &quot;it is widely known&quot;, the report says &quot;that the government sometimes monitors private correspondence and telephones, particularly international communications&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday the supreme court overturned provisions of the Private Voluntary Organisations Act which allowed the minister of labour and social welfare to intervene in appointments of non- governmental organisation (NGO) officials.  The court ordered the reinstatement of 12 members of the executive of the Association of Women's Clubs who the minister had suspended on unspecified grounds in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US report cites the Act as curtailing freedom of association and it has been widely criticised by civil society activists.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - GAY-BASHING has spread to Namibia with Swapo and President Sam Nujoma saying homosexuals are white and perverts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago human rights organisations were horrified when Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe said homosexuals were worse than pigs and dogs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Nujoma has slammed gays and the ruling party Swapo has come out in support of him with a two-page statement which concludes gays should be &quot; uprooted&quot;. Swapo's statement said: &quot;Most of the ardent supporters of these perverts are Europeans who imagine themselves to be the bulwark of civilisation and enlightenment ... we made sacrifices for the liberation of this country and we are not going to allow individuals with alien practices such as homosexuality to destroy the social fabric of our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are convinced that homosexuality is not a natural and objective form of moral history but a hideous deviation of decrepit and inhuman sordid behaviour. In reality lessons learned from the morals of our Namibian culture demonstrate that our morals are far more superior and acceptable to the vast majority of our people who adhered to Christitanity ... Homosexuality deserves a severe contempt and disdain from the Namibian people and should be uprooted totally as a practice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Society for Human Rightsin Windhoek described the attacks on gays as a further indication of emerging totalitarianism in Namibia. &quot;The move appears to be a tip of an insidious, much wider and protracted strategy spearheaded by and or run from State House and such campaigns are apparantly aimed at stemming the tide of a rapidly growing civil society in Namibia,&quot; the society said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - This week's guest writer, Zakes Mda, speaks to skilled black professionals about why they're planning to leave the country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I DON'T feel guilty at all,&quot; says Wilson Mokgadi. &quot;I feel angry instead.  This is not a chicken run. This is a second exile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are in a restaurant at the Johannesburg International Airport. He is on his way to the United States, where he intends to settle permanently. He has no job there yet, but he has the all-important green card, which he got during his &quot;first exile&quot; there, after he had become a permanent resident.  This time he will apply for citizenship and forget all about South Africa.  People of his profession, he says, are in demand in the US, and he will get a job within a week of his landing at JFK Airport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was by sheer chance that I met Mokgadi at the airport. Although I had not seen him for many years, I recognised him at once. He had grown older and looked wiser, but he still had the same scrawny body that made schoolgirls call him &quot;Scarecrow&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I first met him in 1976 when he became my student at a Catholic high school in Lesotho. He was among a group of students, barely in their 20s, who sought exile in Lesotho. He was a bright student who passed the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate examinations with a first class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went on to do a BA degree at the national university. I later met him briefly at Indiana University in the US after he obtained a PhD in mass communication. He went further to do post- graduate diplomas in media law and in the law of intellectual property in the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later worked for National Public Radio and for a number of Public Broadcasting Service affiliates on the east coast of the US. He was a sought- after speaker on the lecture circuit, dispensing his wisdom on issues ranging from the politics of change in South Africa to international communications.  He also became a consultant for various agencies of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mokgadi returned in 1994, just before the elections, and was caught up in the euphoria of the new South Africa. He hoped his qualifications and experience would come in handy at an institution like the SABC, or in the civil service. So he applied for every communications-related post that was advertised in the papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes receipt of his application would be acknowledged, and that would be the last he heard of the matter. In a few instances he was called for interviews. &quot;We'll let you know,&quot; the bureaucrats would say. But to this day he hasn't heard from them. So he ended up teaching part-time at one of the private schools in dilapidated downtown Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was obvious to me that the interviews were just a formality the government was required to go through by law. There was no transparency.  Advertising the jobs and interviewing candidates was just a front. They already had their people for the jobs,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one interview he was told: &quot;You are too qualified. Why don't you start your own consultancy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I chuckle. Over-qualified is the story of my life too, I tell him. Before I decided to be a full-time writer, after I'd left a professorship at Wits University, I used to apply for advertised jobs. I had accumulated a number of degrees and a lot of experience in the field of communications, and I thought I would contribute something to the development of my country. Alas, in instances where I was called for interviews, I was accused of being over- qualified by both black and white bureaucrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I learnt the hard way,&quot; Mokgadi says, &quot;that, in this new South Africa, there is a patronage system, where all important jobs are reserved for members of the African National Congress and those of the liberation aristocracy - their offspring and other relatives of important party officials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He thinks perhaps he is being punished for not being politically active enough in exile. After they &quot;skipped the country&quot; in 1976, most of his comrades joined the ANC in exile. A smaller number found a political home in the Pan Africanist Congress, and others in the Black Consciousness Movement of Azania when it was later formed. But he remained politically neutral, although he participated in important events such as June 6 and Sharpeville commemorations, or in various demonstrations and campaigns for disinvestment that took place in the UK and the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this patronage system, people have to lobby for jobs through party channels. I could have got an SABC job if only I had agreed when friends I knew in exile, who are now high up in the government, wanted to lobby for me.  But I was too proud. I thought my experience and qualifications would speak for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he sees people with less qualifications getting top jobs and becoming directors in various government departments. He is the sort of person who should be in the Independent Broadcasting Authority, he says, for he is more qualified than the whole bunch there. Although he was nominated to the IBA, he was not even called for the hearings by the parliamentary select committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things are in a mess because incompetent people have been put in important positions as a reward for being good party loyalists. That is why the government has to hire consultants at such a high price to do the work of the overpaid but ignorant political appointees for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For instance,&quot; says Mokgadi, &quot;a woman is a senior manager at the SABC because she is the daughter of a senior ANC official. That is her only qualification for the job. She herself admitted as much at a meeting of television producers at the Parktonian Hotel early in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She lamented that she was new in the industry and was made a manager overnight. She said she was grateful to the white staffers of her channel who had made her look good in front of her superiors. Now, tell me, why the hell is she there if she is not qualified for the job? And you know what? I had applied for that job long before she was appointed. But obviously it was already earmarked for a member of the liberation aristocracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surely any government must have political appointees, I argue. You don't expect the spokesman in the president's office, or his speech writer, to be non-political or someone from the Inkatha Freedom Party. It must be a party man, someone with whom he shares a political vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He agrees. &quot;There will always be political appointments. But the director of communications in the department of lands, for instance, must be someone who is an expert on land affairs and on communication. Membership of the liberation aristocracy must not be a consideration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the private sector? Why didn't he get a job there?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Same over-qualification problem,&quot; he says. &quot;Affirmative action is a farce.  They would rather have someone who is under-qualified there, who has no prospects of taking over, or even of doing a better job than they are capable of. That's how they safeguard their positions. When you come with the kind of experience I have, black affirmative action appointees in managerial positions feel threatened. They will fight very hard so that you don't get the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mokgadi is not a member of any political party, he voted for the ANC in the last election. He will probably vote for the ANC again in 1999, since he doesn't see any viable alternative. His admiration for some of its leaders, such as Albertina Sisulu, has not been diminished by the cold shoulder his country has given him. He hero-worships the Sisulu family, whose members, he says, cannot be classified in the ranks of the liberation aristocracy. &quot;They have humanity and have paid their dues,&quot; he adds. &quot;They are wherever they are on merit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another one of his heroes is Thabo Mbeki. He thinks he will make a great president. But Mokgadi is a wounded man, and has no intention of ever coming back to live in South Africa, even under his hero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many other black professionals who feel the same. Some have their suitcases packed, and are waiting for any offer from abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One person who will not leave, even though he has been sidelined, is Phil Mtimkulu. &quot;I am a bit old to leave South Africa,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mtimkulu has a masters degree in political science from Rand Afrikaans University, and has been a lecturer at the University of South Africa for the past 11 years. After 20 years as a student and a teacher of African politics, he is regarded as an expert in his field. He applied for an advertised post of assistant director for the African desk in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would not lobby for the job since he believes people must be employed on merit, not for their political affiliation. After a farcical interview by interviewers, some of whom had not even read his CV, he did not hear anything from the department. A colleague who made inquiries told him: &quot;Forget it.  That post has already been filled. It went to the family. Don't bother applying anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, surely, can the government be accused of nepotism when it has employed in senior positions people like Professor Itumeleng Mosala, Majanku Gumbi and Dr Ishmael Mkhabela, all leaders of the Azanian People's Organisation, which has rejected the Government of National Unity as a sham? Are important jobs not given even to people who defended the apartheid system - members of the National Party, Freedom Front and Conservative Party?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those are high-profile people who have been embraced by the government in pursuit of President Nelson Mandela's goal of reconciliation. People who are non-aligned and unknown like me will get nothing. Whether I am unemployed or not, I will not cause a stir, since no one has heard of me,&quot; says Mtimkulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He does not blame people like Mokgadi for leaving, and thinks more black professionals will leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't like to be saying these things, because they play into the hands of racists who would very much like to see a black- dominated government fail.  This is our government and we must support it. But we cannot just keep quiet when it makes its own black people suffer like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most important people who have been sidelined by the present government is Dr Gordon Sibiya, perhaps the most qualified nuclear-reactor scientist in South Africa. He has a BSc degree in maths and science from Fort Hare University, an honours in physics from the same university, a BSc and a masters degree in electrical engineering from Nottingham University in the UK, and a PhD in nuclear engineering/nuclear reactor physics from the University of Stuttgart in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He does not understand why he is not at the Atomic Energy Corporation (AEC).  He was nominated by three organisations for the membership of its board, but was not chosen. Instead, non-nuclear and non- scientific people were selected to the board. The chairman of the board is not even a scientist. Sibiya finds himself marginalised from energy policy-making, though he is the most qualified. He is very unhappy that he is not using his skills in the nuclear arena in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In any normal technically aware society, I should have been approached to be the chairman of the board at the very least, or the chief executive officer, so as to lead the AEC to a new era.&quot; Instead, he was overlooked, and a Zimbabwean was recruited to a senior post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibiya believes that in a free society people are appointed purely on merit, not for political affiliation. For instance, the scientific adviser to the president of the US is not affiliated to any political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not politically affiliated because I would like to be capable of expressing a professional opinion that is not affected by party political thinking, but that derives purely from professional judgment,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has had two tempting offers to leave South Africa. He is now busy marketing himself to the private sector and to the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If something doesn't happen by the end of this year, my family and I are leaving South Africa for good. I am looking for opportunities in any country where I can practise my profession. I can't be criticised for acting rashly.  For the past 15 years, since my return to South Africa, I have suffered the most humiliating experience of being sidelined in my own profession in my own country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has made representations to the energy ministry and to the office of the deputy president, indicating his readiness to assist the government in the area of energy - of tapping South Africa's energy resources for the benefit of the country. He is hopeful the government will consider the matter at the highest level, and probably within weeks he will hear from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope this will work out,&quot; he says. &quot;I hope you won't be interviewing me at the airport like Wilson Mokgadi.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Fifteen years ago Roger Price witnessed an event he will never forget. Today he is seeking answers to what he saw. Eddie Koch reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROGER PRICE arrived in our office last week loaded with guilt, and a grey plastic bag under his arm filled with the paraphernalia he uses in a quest for the truth behind the ugliest thing that ever happened in his life. The bag contains detailed diagrams, contour maps and aerial photographs with a cross near the site of what could be a shallow grave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Price has always suffered from a bad memory, but he recalls the cause of distress began 15 years ago on the second Thursday of October in 1982, while he was cruising down the hot macadam between Middelburg and Loskop Dam with his four- year-old son on the seat next to him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My pick-up could cruise at 160km/h and go anywhere, but I was doing 144km/h when a bakkie and a Cortina, both of them painted sand brown, came screaming past me. The bakkie had a black man in it and the Cortina had two white men, and they disappeared down the track I was planning to drive down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Price was a geologist working for Anglo American's prospecting division and he was heading for some cliffs next to the Klein Olifants River, looking for valuable sandstone deposits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He turned down the dirt road and, after less than a kilometre, found the men at a bend in the river. They were standing around a barefoot man who had been pulled out of the boot of the Cortina and who was sitting on his haunches, arms hand-cuffed behind his back and a canvas hood over his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In those days black men and white men didn't get together for the fun of it. I knew they weren't there for a picnic. I had pistol in my lap, old American army issue that was sold off to the South African army after the Korean war, so I drove straight up to them and asked what was going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The white men were wearing pistols tucked into the right-hand side of their belts - apparently a sign of a specific subculture. One of them with a pock- marked face said: &quot;Fuck off or we will charge you for pointing a weapon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Price did a U-turn - and has lived with the remorse ever since. &quot;I drove back to Middelburg wondering what to do. I knew it was no use going to the police, so I went to the local magistrate. He looked at me blankly and said there was nothing he could do and that I should go to the police. I went to the station commander. He said he would send somebody around to have a look.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that Price said nothing about the incident to anybody, not even his wife. But every day - &quot;to be accurate, probably every second day&quot; - the geologist has wondered about what happened to the man in the hood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was terrified. For a few days after that, I thought they would come for me. Once I even saw a car parked near my house for a few hours but, with hindsight, I think the driver was probably just waiting to pick up his daughter (from a nearby house) ... I was angry and I was scared, and I have felt guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Price witnessed that day, simply because he had the misfortune to drive down a dirt track in search of some sandstone sediments, was probably nothing out of the ordinary in those days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Middelburg was the former Eastern Transvaal's headquarters of the South African security police. And, as reams of affidavits and evidence about torture in the apartheid years show, security policemen had a habit of driving out of the office to a place in the bush to beat their victims - maybe even throw them into a river and half-drown them - and then have a braai after a hard day's work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was all probably just a routine police interrogation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Price, an ordinary citizen who does an honest eight hours work a day and has a basic sense of human decency, refuses to accept he was just an innocent witness of a minor event in an era that involved far more serious abuses of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, armed with the same bag of maps and diagrams, he took a team from the Mail &amp; Guardian to the spot where the hooded man was dragged from the boot of the Cortina. The area has since been stocked with wild game and declared a nature reserve by Middelburg Town Council, so it involved clambering down sheer cliffs of compacted sandstone to reach the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no shallow graves to be easily found. In fact, while Price was sitting on the edge of the gorge looking for probable grave sites on the river bank, I suggested to him that the men from the security police tended to be cowards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there was even the faintest chance that a member of the public had witnessed their deeds, they would have probably abandoned their mission and returned their detainee to his cell. Prices's intervention that day had probably saved the hooded man's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe the man will read about you in our newspaper and call you to say he is alive,&quot; I said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Price refused to be mollified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If that happens, I will apologise for doing so little.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next stage in his personal quest for the truth involves hiring a light aircraft or a helicopter so that he can take low- level aerial photographs of the river bend. These will be of a much better quality than the ones he has now. They will show where the earth has been disturbed, signs of unnatural vegetation, and will probably tell if there is a grave there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is he going to all this trouble? &quot;Because,&quot; he says, &quot;it is no use having morals unless you are prepared to stand up and shout the odds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, even though he won't admit it, is what Price did on that summer's day 15 years ago, and it is what he is doing now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will acquire the culture of decency this country needs if everyone who was complicit in the treatment of that hooded man - the men from the security branch, the magistrate, the station commander, the residents of Middelburg who knew torture was rife outside their town - did they same.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The medicines control bureaucracy is being accused of denying people with Aids a chance to save their lives. Jim Day reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE are people with Aids in South Africa who want to take Virodene now - and they want no part of what they see as bureaucratic meddling by the Medicines Control Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patients interviewed this week condemned the council's ban of the drug, and said its insistence on following procedure is denying them the chance to try a drug which could save their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council halted testing of the drug after concerns in the scientific community about possible side-effects and about the way its inventors handled both research into the drug and its introduction to the world at large.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're dying anyway, so why not give us the bloody Virodene?&quot; asked one out- patient at the Sparrow Nest Home for People with Aids. &quot;We pray and pray and pray for a cure, then something comes along, and people jump all over the researchers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council is examining the research programme followed by the University of Pretoria scientists who patented the drug, as well as ethical and legal questions that have been raised in connection with the research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no one in the world who knows if it can offer even a glimmer of hope,'' said council head Peter Folb. &quot;No patient is going to be exposed to this chemical until we know if it could be acceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research results at this stage have given no indication that Virodene has any effect on the virus that causes Aids, he said. &quot;We're not in a position to even suggest it is effective,'' he said, adding that the researchers' claims to the contrary amounts to &quot;misrepresentation to the patients&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one of the original participants in early trials of Virodene, who asked to identified only as Mike, accused the council of &quot;making a mountain out of a molehill&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drug was working for him, he said. When his bi-weekly dosages were stopped two weeks ago, following the council's ban, his mouth ulcers came back and he started feeling weaker. &quot;I'm not feeling as well now as I was two weeks ago. I'm a bit worried,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike, like other people with Aids interviewed this week, said he doesn't care about possible side-effects, or that the active ingredient is an industrial solvent, or that it could cause liver damage. He doesn't care where the test results were first published, whether it was in scientific journals or in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and others believe the researchers are on to an affordable, effective remedy. They don't want access to it two years from now after all sorts of tests have been done; they want it now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five patients at Sparrow Nest have signed a statement that they would not hold the researchers - Olga Visser, Dr Callie Landauer and Professor Dirk du Plessis - responsible for any negative effects caused by Virodene. They have asked to be admitted to Virodene trials immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Heidebrecht, representative of the Virodene researchers, said requests from would-be volunteers have been coming in from around the world.  The researchers are drawing up a waiting list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aids care-givers, working in hospices and other programmes, admit they are advising patients to put their names on the list. They predict the researchers will be swamped as soon as they get the green light to resume drug trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council halted testing because procedures followed by the researchers were &quot;entirely unacceptable,&quot; Folb said. Research will not resume until proper guidelines are implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These guidelines are being developed by a committee from the University of Pretoria and the Gauteng Health Department. A final report is due out in two weeks. Committee members would not say when Virodene research could begin again, but it could be shortly after the council reviews the committee report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heidebrecht said he hopes that research will include testing on human subjects, but Folb said in his view the researchers will &quot;have to go back to square one&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funding for further research is still up in the air, though Heidebrecht said the researchers were still hoping to receive government funding. Alan Hirsch, chief director of industrial and development technology strategy in the Department of Trade and Industry, said government funding was still under consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy over Virodene started when the researchers went before the Cabinet to ask for R3,7-million to continue their research. Their presentation, arranged by Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma, shocked the scientific and research community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People with Aids and care-givers, however, continue to support Zuma. They see her as someone who cut through cumbersome procedures to get Virodene on to the market quickly and cheaply. Current cutting-edge treatment for Aids is prohibitively expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like most people with Aids, Gert Tolmay cannot afford the expensive medications. Emaciated and ill, his immune system all but shut down, he lives at St Christopher's Home for People Living with Aids. He says all he wants to know about the Virodene researchers is: &quot;Can they help me? Can they help other people? It's a risk you've got to take. You've got to try.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hendrik Nel, who also has Aids, agrees. He has not formally applied to be admitted into the research programme, but given the opportunity, he would use Virodene. &quot;If you don't want to take a chance you will not know. Give these guys a chance, at least they are doing something.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - MORE than a week after rioting to protest high taxes, residents of Johannesburg's coloured areas remain defiant of the government, saying that an old oppressor has merely been replaced with a new one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rates row which sparked the rioting - in which police have confirmed two people died - is only one of many reasons for their anger, residents said, adding that police response to the protest only aggravated the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police fired wildly and just shot anyone they saw,&quot; said Celia Dan, whose 11-year- old son David was shot in the leg during the fighting. &quot;What did an 11-year-old boy do?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Civics leader) Basil Douglas is the only person that is willing to fight for the coloured community. He should be awarded a medal,&quot; said Eldorado Park resident Sonja Olifant. &quot;Douglas,&quot; said a pensioner, &quot;is the only one standing up for coloureds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglas tapped into a popular vein when he called last week's stayaway to protest rising electricity and water tariffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an act of revenge by Mandela because the coloured community did not support the ANC during the elections,&quot; said Olifant. She faces electricity and water arrears of more than R9000, but said she cannot afford to pay because she is unemployed. &quot;We suffered under the old regime and we are still suffering today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many residents blamed the Gauteng government for neglecting the coloured community. &quot;This is ridiculous. Does the council think we are rich? We won't pay these high rates,&quot; said one woman, who refused to be identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eldorado Park resident Colette du Pont said Gauteng premier Tokyo Sexwale had failed to respond to calls from residents to deal with the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this had happened in a black township he would be visiting the people.  But he doesn't care about us,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents have accused municipal councils of failing to keep their promises to scrap arrears accumulated prior to the April 1994 election. &quot;No arrears were scrapped in Eldorado Park, only in Soweto,&quot; said Du Pont.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prema Naidoo, chair of the Southern Metropolitan Substructure, dismissed the claims. He said some residents had not paid their accounts for two years and this explained why they owed as much as R15000. Naidoo said the residents' calls to scrap arrears that accumulated after the 1994 election were unrealistic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE ANGELLA JOHNSON INTERVIEW</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PULEEZE, do not call Basil Douglas a &quot;so- called coloured&quot;. It pisses him off. Like the k-word does black folk. He is Coloured, with a capital C, and proud of it. Heck, he is even prepared to fight for the right to be called coloured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man who organised last week's mass coloured stay-away protest, in which two people were killed during an orgy of violence, compares his identity crisis with that of the Maoris' battle for self- determination in New Zealand and the Native Americans' struggle to survive in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are the original people of this country, but the whites took away our land, our language and made slaves of us. Now this new government comes in and wants to call us black. We don't want it, so they describe us as so- called coloureds. It's ugly and insulting. A slander.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglas, leader of the South Western Joint Civics Association (Sowejoca), is convinced &quot;his people&quot; are being discriminated against by a racist, black- dominated government. &quot;Nationhood and oppression are the issues,'' he says.  There was a time when he thought being black was beautiful - during his political apprenticeship in the 1970s, when he sported a huge afro and admired the Black Panther political movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But times change. The former gang leader, turned boxer, teacher, political agitator (aligned to various parties) and now community leader, has acquired enough street smarts to tap into popular discontent and champion their cause.  Using the fears and insecurities of coloured people about their role in the new South Africa, and his own, Douglas has cornered a niche market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want our own identity . not to be just South Africans, but to belong to our own cultural group,'' he says. &quot;Being a coloured is an accepted name and we want to keep it - at least in the transformation period.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute over payment arrears for services in Gauteng's impoverished coloured townships is providing a platform for this political agitator to air his demand for nationhood. And he is making the most of the media attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days Douglas is so busy that our meeting had to sandwich a hastily convened press conference, at an Inkatha Freedom Party office in Johannesburg, called by Sowejoca - in other words Douglas - to condemn what it describes as the Eldorado Park massacre.With the sleeves of his cream Pierre Cardin shirt rolled up workmanlike, he handles the conference like a seasoned professional, watched over by a beaming Mangosuthu Buthelezi general election poster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The handful of journalists in attendance are not his usual target audience, but he's making valiant attempts to win us over. That's until a young radio reporter decides to lob in some provocative questions about his responsibility for children being involved in the stayaway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His bulky frame crammed behind a table, flanked by six other Sowejoca members, Douglas's huge chest heaves in agitation. He begins to bristle and the mask of charm slides off his face. &quot;This woman,'' he mutters tersely to a lieutenant on his left, &quot;I don't want to get into an argument with her.'' Later he tries to exact revenge. &quot;Where are you from?&quot; he asks, though it is clear from her accent she is South African.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She tells him this. &quot;But you are white!'' he counters snidely. &quot;You must be from somewhere else.'' The encounter reminds me that Douglas is a pan- Africanist. &quot;I was just teasing her,'' he insists afterwards. But I had whiffed an unpleasant odour of racism in the exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detractors say he is a troublemaker who causes division within communities.  They claim his agenda is self-promotion and power. It has also been said he takes advantage of the very people he claims to serve and that his support lies largely with &quot;wayward youth&quot;- which might explain the blazing barricades, stonings and pot shots taken at police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is a man seemingly able to reinvent himself to suit the situation; to move seamlessly from one viewpoint to another. Take his statement to me that President Nelson Mandela is responsible for the &quot;economic ethnic cleansing'' of coloureds. Some minutes later he declares: &quot;We love Mandela.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His arguments are sometimes equally contradictory: &quot;Describing people as black or white is racist,&quot; he says, yet he insists: &quot;We accept coloured as a cultural definition.&quot; He rejects mainstream politics; &quot;However, if the people want me to stand for Parliament, I'll consider it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe Douglas is just a canny politician at heart. He clearly has a winning way with the community he once taught, and they respond by following him with almost blind devotion. He claims a constituency of 300000, including people from the Cape. &quot;The people trust and have confidence in me. I've made peace between gangs in Westbury. Even husbands and wives call me in to mediate if they have a bad argument.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the same man who is propagating incorrect information that four people (including a four-year-old and a seven- year-old) were killed during the stayaway, even though the police record shows that only two were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is public confidence in him misplaced? His statements seem at times to miss the link between power and responsibility. And his rhetoric appears to be racially divisive. Among them is the claim that coloureds suffer job discrimination at the hands of affirmative action because they are not &quot;black enough''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask him for concrete examples of where this occurs, and he can only reply: &quot; People say the bosses are looking for someone with a black surname ... this is racism in reverse.'' It sounds apocryphal, the stuff of urban legend, but Douglas insists: &quot;It's government policy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dismisses prominent coloureds (some of whom refer to themselves as black) in the government: Cheryl Carolus, Walter Sisulu and Trevor Manuel, to name just a few. &quot;They represent their bank accounts and their wallets. They are doing nothing for their people.'' The only apartheid ethnic group which escapes his criticism is the Indians; they don't exist in his equation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not the first time Douglas has mobilised residents around long- standing, legitimate grievances such as high rents. In 1994, he ignited the tinder created by poverty, unemployment and an acute housing shortage, with a similar stayaway. The death toll then was one, and 28 were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglas has had a chequered political history. He says he resigned from the Pan Africanist Congress in 1993 because he wanted to focus on community issues. But at the time PAC general secretary Khoisan X claimed Douglas had been expelled from the organisation after allegedly assaulting a member of the Ennerdale branch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When his expulsion became public, he linked up with Malcolm Lupton, founder of the National Liberation Front (NLF), a coloured leadership group which campaigned for a coloured homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he severed his tie with the PAC because of personal differences with Khoisan X, and with the NLF because it was a racist organisation. Funny that, he left teaching because of personal differences with the principal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglas, who describes himself as a born- again Christian, has been married for nearly 13 years and has two children, a boy aged 11 and girl aged seven.  He was born in Noordsig, a mere spitting distance from Soweto, 36 years ago.  His early life was one of abject poverty, scavenging food growing wild in nearby sewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second of seven children, he was shunted between mother and grandmother after his parents divorced. At 14 he dropped out of school and joined the Non Beggars gang, soon rising to be its leader. He still has a faded tattoo (he tried to erase it when respectability set in) on his left arm with the word Boss encircled by a heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encouraged by his mentor, the poet Don Mattera, he eventually went back to school and matriculated. Teacher training college followed, and he went on to teach history, geography and physical education in several coloured areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His political CV is similarly eclectic.&quot;I don't belong to any political party. We are in IFP premises because they are very kind people. They are our friends and have done many good things for coloured people. One day, if my head turns, I will study their political paper.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglas is clearly a man who likes to keep his options open for whatever opportunity presents itself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE government conceded this week that the Independent Broadcasting Authority's (IBA) mandate for the SABC, central to plans to transform the broadcaster, is too expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Telecommunications Ministry and the SABC said funding constraints and suggestions that the broadcaster become commercially self-sufficient had rendered many of the IBA's recommendations impractical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has undertaken instead to finance specific SABC projects and will be funding the broadcaster to the tune of R177,4-million from October 1997 to March 1998. Minister Jay Naidoo and SABC management will revisit the IBA mandate to determine what more can be salvaged.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC spokesman Enoch Sithole said management had been &quot;made to understand that recommendations by the IBA could be overturned by Cabinet and the changes would then be binding on the broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are at a crossroads and the government needs to tell us what type of broadcaster it envisages. If they want us to be profitable some things will have to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naidoo's representative Connie Molusi said: &quot;How feasible is the mandate and will it be attained over a long period of time?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA declined to comment, beyond saying it expected to be notified first of any changes to the mandate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mandate, costed at R191-million, includes broadcasting in 11 languages, increasing local programming content and educational programming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the SABC is suffering heavy losses, blamed in part on the ambitious mandate and its overall transformation drive. Of the IBA proposals, the ministry believes the 11 languages element is the most impractical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government has to decide what it can afford to allocate the SABC for it to meet the national broadcasting service mandate set by the IBA. The SABC has to consider what it can deliver with the funds provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sithole said the SABC needed a clear direction from government. &quot;If the SABC has to be self-sufficient there must be a realisation that we are talking about a totally different type of public broadcasting as was recommended by the IBA and different to what is practised elsewhere in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are possibly talking about a form of public broadcasting which is mainly commercial and which accommodates a public service mandate in a commercial environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There cannot be any beating about the bush, public broadcasting will then be secondary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - From carpets to computers, the public register reveals what gifts MPs have received - or in some cases what they haven't received. Rehana Rossouw reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALMOST all the visitors to room V121 in Parliament this week were journalists eager to peek at the assets of South Africa's elected leaders. If they were hoping for evidence of improprieties, bribes, payoffs and conflicts of interests, they were disappointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the register does make for interesting reading. And with members of Parliament now required by law to disclose all assets and financial interests, it acts as a check on any MP likely to be wooed by an expensive gift or swayed by financial interest in a company.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, the register shows that Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu owns 1 000 shares, valued at R1 each, in the Reach Out Publishing Company, raising the question of whether the company publishes school textbooks or educational materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bengu's spokesman said the minister was a founder member of the company in the 1970s and had been a member of the board. After being elected to Parliament, he quit his position on the board but retained his shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the advice of the executive director of the company, the minister did not think it necessary to cede his shares as the company is not a major publisher of educational material,&quot; said Mali. &quot;But if at any point anyone raises objections to his shareholding, he is willing to relinquish them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The register opened for the first time last week. By law MPs and senators must list, for perusal by the public, all financial interests, including any extra- parliamentary remuneration, directorships, gifts valued at more than R350, property and pensions. A separate confidential register, to be seen only by Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal's parliamentary ethics committee and the registrar, contains greater financial detail, and information on immediate families. MPs who fail to list all their financial interests - and are caught - are to be fined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public register offers some pointers about lifestyles of the MPs and ministers, notably their lack of material possessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winnie Madikizela-Mandela writes &quot;have nothing to declare&quot; when asked about shares, employment outside Parliament, directorships, consultancies and partnerships. She states &quot;have no such gifts&quot;, &quot;have no such benefits&quot; and &quot; have no such travel&quot; when asked about those. Asked whether she owns any land and property, she says no. The mansion in Soweto must belong to someone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adelaide Tambo lists two properties - one in London valued at Pounds 300 000 (approximately R2,1 million). She records that son Dali gives her a little something each month to help with the upkeep of the family home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party's Sheila Camerer is either more transparent or a shrewd investor. She owns shares in 19 companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Party MPs in general dabble more in the stock market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the travel department, Colin Eglin reveals that he attended a meeting of Liberal International in the United Kingdom in 1996, and all costs were borne by HF Oppenheimer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC MP Peter Mokaba is pinning his hopes on the performance of the Headlines Hair Salon, which he owns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliamentarians' lists of gifts are good reading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Defence Minister Ronnie Kasrils received a bust of Alexander the Great valued at R600 from the Greek Ministry of Defence. Defence Minister Joe Modise says he got nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo has a lion skin valued at R4 500, but he cannot remember who gave it to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting Minister Jay Naidoo has three cellphones, two from Vodacom and one from Ericsson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minerals and Energy Minister Penuell Maduna got &quot;one piece of carpet&quot; from President Rafsanjani of Iran, value unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Breweries gave Public Service and Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya five cases of beer for Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Minister Dullah Omar's staff gave him a jersey for his birthday. He declared it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The host who gave the most was the Taiwanese government, which paid for most of our parliamentarians' excursions abroad and bought them gifts while they were there. They still lost out in the diplomatic race against China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taiwanese vice-president gave Thabo Mbeki a notebook computer and printer valued at R10 000. Nzo got a Sanyo mini music system from the Taiwanese foreign minister valued at R1 400. He also got a platinum Seiko wristwatch worth R2 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Defence Ministry of Taiwan gave Kasrils a Pentax camera worth R1 500.  He also got a jade carving (R1 200) and ceramic camel (R800) from the Taiwanese armed forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maduna got one trip paid for by the Taiwanese government. Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela attended conferences on freedom and democracy in Taiwan, in January 1995 and January 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy speaker Baleka Kgotsitsile got a Technics CD player from the vice- president of Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She lists the total value of all her gifts, including this one, at less than R350.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taiwanese gave the ANC's new chief whip Max Sisulu a wristwatch, a vase, a camera, a radio, a Phillips CD and a cassette player with a total value of R3 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sisulu also visited Taiwan courtesy of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  He was part of a six-person delegation which also visited the People's Republic of China. The Chinese government gave them nothing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Intelligence agent Arthur Kemp appears to have knowledge of a wider plot behind Chris Hani's assassination, writes Stefaans BrUmmer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARTHUR KEMP, the right-wing journalist who gave address details for a &quot;hit list&quot; to Chris Hani's killers, had links with the old National Intelligence Service (NIS) - raising new questions about possible complicity or foreknowledge in official agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian has also confirmed the identity of one of two NIS &quot; handlers&quot; involved with one-time Civil Co-operation Bureau agent Eugene Riley.  The handlers allegedly received intelligence reports from Riley warning of Hani's impending assassination. Riley died in an unsolved shooting in early 1994, but his girlfriend, Julie Wilken, has confirmed she typed the reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports, revealed in the M&amp;G a fortnight ago, correctly specified April 10 1993 as the date Hani would be killed, and claimed members of the African National Congress's security and intelligence structures would be involved.  Wilken has claimed at least one of the reports reached Riley's handlers before the assassination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kemp, who at different times worked for The Citizen and rightwing publication Die Patriot, was arrested after the assassination. He was used as a state witness in the trial of Conservative Party politician Clive Derby- Lewis and Polish immigrant Janusz Walus, who are both serving life sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their trial Kemp testified how he had supplied a list with addresses - which he claimed he believed would be used so demonstrations could be held at the homes of enemies of the right wing - to Gaye Derby-Lewis, wife of Clive Derby-Lewis. The prosecution contended the list of 10 names had been a hit list. Hani's name appeared third on the list, after Nelson Mandela and Joe Slovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intelligence and police sources have confirmed to the M&amp;G that Kemp, a former police security branch member, had been an informant for the NIS. It is alleged that after the assassination the NIS decided to play &quot;open cards&quot; with FW de Klerk's government: the agency told the then- president of its relationship with Kemp, while denying that Kemp had acted in an official capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a new twist Kemp, who moved to Britain last year, recently contacted a London publication, claiming to have knowledge of a wider plot behind Hani's death. He did not give details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kemp's claim of a wider plot echoes a similar one by Mohammed Amin Laher, whom Wilken has identified as a double agent for Riley and the ANC's then- Department of Intelligence and Security (DIS), and as the source of Riley's information on the impending assassination. Laher has claimed in a call from an undisclosed location that Hani's death involved a conspiracy &quot;on both sides of the spectrum&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Wilken and some of Riley's former associates believe Riley had fed the information to the old department of military intelligence, the M&amp;G this week confirmed that the addressees on the documents - identified in the documents only as &quot;P&amp;F&quot; - were in fact two NIS members who at the time operated under the false company name of Jacaranda Pamphlets, an NIS front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;P&quot;, whose name has been supplied to the M&amp;G but who cannot be named for legal reasons, specialised in gathering information on the right wing in the early 1990s and also had extensive contact with DIS members when they returned from exile after the unbanning of the ANC. He was instrumental in setting up links between DIS and NIS members in the negotiations that led to the amalgamation of the two intelligence bodies to become the new National Intelligence Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;P&quot;, who now works from the agency's head office in Pretoria, this week denied having received the documents or having known Riley. Agency liaison officer Willem Thron declined comment, saying the matter concerned the &quot;now- defunct NIS&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other developments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* One of the original members of the DIS team that did an investigation on behalf of the ANC into the assassination confirmed Hani had had fears about his own security and had unsuccessfully agitated with the ANC to step up his security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the DIS investigation had found evidence of a second killer or group of killers, besides Walus, whom the DIS believed had been involved. He said this was based on an eyewitness report of a second car besides Walus's; on the angle of a bullet which seemed to have come from a different direction to where Walus had been standing, and on evidence that someone had been hiding behind a wall next door to Hani's Boksburg home at the time of the assassination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed police at the time had been &quot;unwilling&quot; to follow the leads uncovered by the DIS investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The documents in the M&amp;G's possession are only part of a much larger collection of information which Riley had fed to &quot;P&amp;F&quot; at the NIS, a large proportion of them supposedly based on information supplied by Laher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior serving intelligence official, formerly with DIS, has confirmed the existence of the documents, which deal with matters as divergent as arms smuggling, politicians' affairs and a supposed plot to use a computer programme to favour the ANC in the elections. But he claimed the information contained in the documents often had no bearing on reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question remains, however, how Riley and Laher could have had foreknowledge of the assassination plot, and how they could have remained in the NIS information- gathering chain if they had supplied consistently false information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Hani and another leading South African Communist Party leader had repeated contact with an askari, a former ANC member &quot;turned&quot; by the police security branch, who &quot;turned&quot; again and clandestinely gave the SACP information on security branch matters. Shortly before the assassination, the askari warned Hani that things were &quot;becoming hot&quot; for him</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - VIOLENCE in the taxi industry is being fuelled by sinister &quot; third force&quot; operatives who encourage the use of hitmen to kill rivals, according to a programme to be aired on the SABC next Thursday (February 20).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence For Hire, a 30-minute documentary looking at the bloodier side of the taxi business, shows that mafia-style contract killers can earn up to R10 000 or a taxi of their own for shooting prominent operators in the war over lucrative routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documentary says that police and other factions deliberately use violence as a destabilising factor in the same way that they once used it to get rid of political activists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transport Minister Mac Maharaj says in the documentary that the practice has become firmly entrenched. He claims he can name at least 50 individuals known to be involved, and says it is hard to believe that the police and security forces have not been active participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With more than 300 people killed as a result of taxi violence last year, it is one of the biggest problems facing the government. It is also a social issue with implications for the entire country - although Gauteng and the Cape have been particularly badly affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The taxi industry mushroomed following deregulation in the 1980s, and has been plagued by near anarchy since then - largely owing to competition for limited, and over-subscribed, profitable routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most drivers in the Cape carry firearms, allegedly provided by corrupt police officials, who are also said to collude with different taxi associations to offer protection. There are also claims that some police actually own vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ingrid Gavshon, the programme's producer and director, says she was given unsubstantiated information that former Umkhonto weSizwe fighters, askaris and Inkatha Freedom Party members had also drifted into this lucrative killing industry as &quot;killing is what they do best&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Transport Ministry seems unable to stop the outbreaks of bloodletting - often involving innocent passengers - opting instead to blame both the ministries of Justice and Safety and Security for not being tough enough on those arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gavshon, who did all her filming in the Cape, suggested that one way to start cleaning up the industry is for transport inspectors to impound vehicles which are clearly not roadworthy and fine their owners. &quot;Getting tough even with minor infringements sends a clear signal that the government will not continue to sit idly by while these people turn our roads into killing fields.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said another problem was that police officers often became too close to those involved. &quot;Moving the police around with more regularity would lessen the chance of corruption forged through close ties.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - ANC demands M&amp;G apologise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAWYERS for prominent figures in the African National Congress have demanded a retraction and apology from the Mail &amp; Guardian for its report last week linking them to a private deportation centre. The M&amp;G reported that senior members of the ANC Women's League - including Baleka Mbete- Kgositsile, Adelaide Tambo, Nomvula Mokonyane and Lindiwe Maseko - had an interest in the Lindela Accommodation Centre, a private deportation centre in Randfontein on the West Rand. The women were involved in the creation of Dyambu Trust, which controls Lindela. Mokonyane and Maseko are registered as trustees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter from lawyer Roy Stoler accused the M&amp;G of &quot;sensationalism and adverse publicity for the ANC members who are mentioned therein&quot;. M&amp;G acting editor David Beresford said the newspaper stands by the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hijacking syndicate discovered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLICE followed a satellite tracking signal to a cache of stolen vehicles on a remote Mpumalanga farm, and the discovery of a hijacking syndicate that involves at least two corrupt police officers. Police arrested one person and are hunting another 10 after the Mpumalanga anti-hijacking unit swooped on the deserted Bronkhorstspruit farm on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a chance discovery. Police were alerted by a training pilot who had picked up a signal from a truck hijacked last month.Officers found stripped trucks and car parts destined for export, illegal weapons, ammunition and fake diamonds and gold. Captain Harry Scheepers said the farm, owned by a local businessman, served as workshop and hideout, and was so remote it was &quot; the last place to look for stolen vehicles&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exam scandal report due</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CONTRIBUTING factor in the Gauteng matric exam scandal may have been the failure of the Department of Education to fill a key post in the exam section.  The Department of Education created the post of Director for Examination and Certification to administer and oversee the matric exam process, but never filled it. Gauteng awaits the report of the Khumalo commission into the matric exam scandal, due next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Education has also confirmed that examination markers still have not been paid. They were supposed to have received their salaries last month, but Edcent Williams, chief director for support services, said there was a mismatch between the markers' claim forms and the government payroll system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Axe murderer could be in SA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A MAN suspected of murdering his lover in Phoenix, Arizona may have fled back to South Africa, after dumping the body in the desert. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of Robert Tennyson, 38, who is a Canadian citizen but was born in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tennyson is wanted for the murder of James Garrett Daniels, 43, whose body was discovered by children playing near the desert town of Cave Creek, Arizona. He was apparently murdered with an axe. Police followed Tennyson's credit card trail from Phoenix, to New York, then to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demand for more rape courts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Ministry of Justice should establish more courts specialising in the prosecution of rape cases, anti-rape groups in the Cape say. South Africa has one of the highest incidents of rape in the world, but has only one court specialising in sexual offences - at Wynberg in the Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rape Crisis is conducting a study of the Wynberg court. A report is due in May.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - PENSION fraud is costing South Africa at least R1-billion a year, and only direct government control of the welfare system can stop it, a government task team says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task team - the Committee For Restructuring of Social Security, led by Reverend Frank Chikane - says the current province-based system of handing out pensions and grants is in &quot;crisis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cabinet has already been briefed on the team's 94-page report, and the recommendations will be phased in from next year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says that about R1-billion of the R14,3-billion allocated each year for the needy is lost to corruption or incompetence as the provinces struggle to control their welfare officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task team found that in the Western Cape alone, master files identifying beneficiaries of payouts were woefully inaccurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly half the master files for the House of Representatives, 81% of the House of Assembly files and 89% of the Cape Provincial Administration contained invalid South African identity numbers. Other provinces' records were probably even worse, the team says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team says the only solution is for the national Welfare Department to intervene and develop a new delivery system that would apply to all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The primary advantage to the pensioner population is that they know that wherever they live in South Africa they will get exactly the same treatment,&quot; task team member Alan Thompson says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A national system will be easier to co- ordinate, reducing the potential for cross province multiplier claims and fraud ... If there is one national set of instructions there can be no question of 'we don't do it that way here'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No price-tag is put to the plan, but it could cost millions of rands to put such a system in place and hire personnel to run it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There could also be constitutional difficulties in forcing provinces to fall into line behind the national minister, Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team also says that punishment of corrupt officials is ineffective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whenever a member of staff is suspected of fraud or corruption, the matter is reported to the SAPS,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The task of investigating and prosecuting the suspect is left to the SAPS .  The investigation and prosecuting process takes years to complete and is frequently inconclusive when the suspect is either not charged or acquitted for lack of evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key obstacle to weeding out rogue officials is the complexity of departmental disciplinary rules. There is also little communication between provincial departments, the report adds, and the police and the government blame each other when corrupt officials slip through the net.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Shobashobane massacre has come to trial, but the list of suspects is decreasing and people question whether justice will be done. Ann Eveleth reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DUMAZILE NYAWOSE watched helplessly as armed men stabbed her 17-year-old daughter Phindile to death. They propped her limp body in a sitting position in a waterhole and moved on. Amos Nyawose eluded his would-be killers, but was unable to stop them from disembowelling his cousin Kipha and cutting off his genitals. Alpheus Shabane cannot forget the sight of his small son in the marauding crowd.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a year after an army of killers descended upon the tiny rural village of Shobashobane wielding knives, spears, guns and sticks, those accused of taking part in the massacre have come to trial in the Durban Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Survivors of the attack early on Christmas Day 1995 have come to the witness stand, one after another, to recount the events of the day, and to testify to the horror they saw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-one defendants are sitting in the dock, charged with the murder of 18 men, women and children. They had been identified as African National Congress supporters; Shobashobane was an Inkatha stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in this courtroom barely four months ago that former defence minister Magnus Malan and 19 others were freed from murder conspiracy charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of a repeat hovers over the public gallery, where observers from both parties watch the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list of 23 suspects already has been reduced to 21. One suspect died, and the state was forced to withdraw charges against Richard Nzama last week because photographic evidence linking him to the attack had &quot;disappeared&quot;.  Charges against eight other suspects - including three Izingolweni police who were among the first arrested - were dropped last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to testimony in court, as many as 2000 attackers descended upon the tiny village. An observer outside the courtroom asked: &quot;Where are the rest of them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a few of those named in the witnesses' testimony sit in the mega-dock built last year for Malan and his co-accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dumazile Nyawose, for example, testified that she heard a woman name the murder weapon that should be used on her daughter, who was running to the Shongwe River when she slipped and fell and was cornered by her attackers. &quot;I heard some men saying that this woman could not be shot. A female from up the hill said 'Cut her throat with a cane knife' and I recognised the voice of this female,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no women among the accused, only 19 men and two youths, all of them looking bored, some casually resting bare feet on the front of the dock.  Some stiffen slightly when a witness identifies them by the number in front of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least four witnesses have placed Inkatha Freedom Party Izingolweni leader Sipho Ngcobo at the scene of the attack. They have testified that he was armed with a shotgun. His girlfriend, Isabel, sits every day outside the court. She says she knows nothing about the attack. Although she lives in Izingolweni, she says she was not there on the fateful day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngcobo's new ANC counterpart from Shobashobane, local government councillor Anderson Nyawose, is trying to restore peace to the place where his uncle - former ANC leader Kipha Nyawose - was hunted down. Anderson Nyawose says there can be no peace unless Ngcobo spends some time in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We as the ANC support amnesty,&quot; he says, when asked about the special amnesty deal under consideration in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will all get amnesty one day, but they must go to jail for some time before we can accept that. But so far I don't feel happy because I don't know who will get convicted. We are sleeping at home now, but the people don't feel safe since the (alleged) attackers got bail and the violence started again,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes we talk about peace, but the following day we hear the guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A FIGHT for control over Western Province cricket has degenerated into accusations of drunkenness and racism, with a senior cricket official and judicial officer telling sports commentator Martin Locke to &quot; fuck off back to Rhodesia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Percy Sonn, vice-president of the Western Province Cricket Association, was censured two weeks ago by his executive for his allegedly abusive language and disorderly behaviour at post-match functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonn, who is deputy attorney general of the Western Cape and a powerful political figure, had been tipped to take over the association's presidency in June when incumbent Clem Druker steps down.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But senior members of the province's cricketing fraternity, who refused to comment on the record, said Sonn's behaviour should scupper his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said his unruly behaviour has damaged his reputation and hampered his ability to represent the cricketing fraternity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonn has admitted that he has, on occasion, drunk excessive amounts of alcohol but said &quot;elements in the executive&quot; were trying to discredit him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The white English people on the executive live in England and not in the Cape and should return there because they can't handle a coloured person as president,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Elements on the executive are out to get me, but if they stab me in the back I will stab them in the stomach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonn declined to detail the motion to censure him, saying only its contents would &quot;make a lot of people's hair stand on end&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He defended his tendency to &quot;get drunk from time to time ... since drinking is so much part of the culture of my people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonn said the &quot;specific instance where people thought I had misbehaved&quot; was when he approached Locke at a function following the third day of the recent test match against India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a definite axe to grind about these foreign commentators who invade our airwaves,&quot; he said. &quot;After a few drinks with some press men I told Locke to fuck off back to Rhodesia and he didn't take kindly to this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were a few ladies present who might have taken offence to my words.  I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association's chief executive Arthur Turner declined to comment, but Druker said he believed Sonn would be a capable president.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE administration at Stellenbosch University, bastion of Afrikaner education, is facing a rebellion from its academics and students over its management style and secret pay-outs to five senior staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also emerged this week that the university has been fined R90 000 by the Receiver of Revenue after failing to deduct tax from the pay-outs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of highly-respected academics say they will back Fourie against the rector. Many of the academics are critical of the manner in which the &quot; top-bestuur&quot; manage the university .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week the university's student newspaper, Die Matie, really let rip with an article entitled &quot;Battle lines drawn in money war&quot;, and a scathing editorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian revealed in December how two vice-rectors, Christo Viljoen and Walter Claassen, director of finance Nico Basson, personnel director Kobus van Wyk and the head of student affairs, Flip de Wet, all received cheques ranging in value between R130 000 and R200 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cheques were personally authorised by Van Wyk, who attempted to keep them secret, and initially tax was not deducted. The university is now paying a penalty for this oversight of R45 000, as well as R45 000 to cover interest on the arrears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the story broke, the university council chairman Gys Steyn said the pay- outs were in lieu of sabbatical leave which the five men were unable to take, such was their commitment to the running of the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the pay-outs had been sanctioned by a university council committee that had kept no minutes of that particular meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the answers failed to satisfy members of the senate and academic staff, who believe the rector and the five changed university policy strictly for their own benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They believe the saga is jeopardising the university's future as an Afrikaans- language university in the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian has documentary evidence that Steyn instructed auditors Coopers and Lybrand to check the legality of the payments months after they were made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to Steyn, Coopers and Lybrand indicated that the period of leave, allegedly cashed in for these payments, had not been marked off on individual leave cards, and this should be amended immediately. The auditors have recommended the university deduct the tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting on Friday is expected to be a showdown between those who want to challenge Van Wyk's leadership and the manner in which he deals with staff and student problems, and those in top administrative positions, wanting to protect their positions and status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former employees of the university have indicated that Claassen and Viljoen are temperamental. Some students who have angered Van Wyk by publicly criticising the university say the same about him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Wyk has ties with many powerful political and financial figures in the Afrikaner community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has built a reputation as a staunch defender of the Afrikaans language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Wyk has indicated that he wishes to protect the Afrikaans character of the university in the face of government attempts to introduce bilingualism on to campus to make it more accessible to black and coloured students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His ability to do this is now being questioned by some of the best minds on campus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - JULIA BOPAPE was the mother of an alleged criminal. Last week a crowd of 4 000 in Mamelodi, Pretoria, stoned her to death for the deeds of her son, Handsome Bopape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was killed at a meeting during which the community accused her of encouraging her son to commit crimes, and of paying his bail.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bopape is among the latest victims of an increasing trend toward mob rule.  South Africans fed up with poor policing and the slow pace of justice are turning in greater numbers to vigilantism in an attempt to stop spiralling crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say there has been an increase in vigilantism country-wide, though most incidents are impromptu responses by small communities, rather than the deliberate acts of formal organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Reg Crewe of the Detective Service said there &quot;are no statistics to indicate the extent of the problem, but intances of mob justice are really a cause for concern&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crewe said sometimes people are frustrated by poor police work, but often &quot; communities don't understand how the system works, they want instant justice, and they are not prepared to wait&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three incidents were reported in Johannesburg and Pretoria this week, while in the Northern Province authorities know of four groups formed to combat crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng police spokesman Azwinndini Nengovhela said they are an indication that &quot;people are developing this kind of (vigilante) tendency&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vigilante activities in KwaZulu-Natal are being carried out &quot;spontaneously&quot;, not by organisations, said police director Bala Naidoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Western Cape, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) is the only formal vigilante group, but police representative John Sterrenberg did not rule out the existence of similar groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crewe said: &quot;Unlike Pagad, other groups have not declared themselves publicly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free State, Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape are the only provinces where mob justice, once carried out on political grounds in the 1980s, has stopped or decreased considerably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community and business groups say they understand the increase in street justice, but condemn &quot;extreme measures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Eric Tocknell, managing director of Business Against Crime: &quot;The community is sending out a clear message that they are frustrated by the increasing crime rate, and see mob justice as the only way to solve the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tocknell said people should realise crime- fighting is not only the responsibility of the police, and that the communities, the police and business should form partnerships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penrose Ntloti, secretary general of the South African National Civics Organisation (Sanco) said it does not support vigilante groups because &quot;some people may have hidden agendas&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Vicious cycle: A 2 000-strong vigilante group takes on crime in Northern Province. Tangeni Amupadhi reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A GROUP of more than 2 000 vigilantes is dispensing its own brand of street justice in Northern Province, prompting authorities to call in the army to shore up official crime-fighting forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, called Mapogo a Mathamaga - from a Sotho proverb meaning the leopard can change its colours when provoked - has put 30 suspected criminals behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve of its members have been charged with murder, and another 30 are under investigation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of Mapogo a Mathamaga freely admit they routinely beat confessions out of their suspects. At least three have died from injuries received under interrogation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial government officials conceded this week that poor policing has allowed vigilante groups to mushroom. Another three groups are said to be operating in the province. The officials said the province would call in the military and special police units to provide support for the beleaguered police. They were unable to say when the deployment would take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mapogo a Mathamaga vowed to continue its campaign, claiming that since it began four months ago crime rates have plummeted - a claim police reluctantly concede may be true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mapogo - which also has an English name, Business Shield - was formed by businessmen in the central region of the province, after the murder of six local businssmen and a spate of burglaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has grown from 100 members to more than 2 000, operating in the towns of Nebo, Sekhukhune, Tefelkop and Groblersdal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group initially arrested suspects and handed them over to the police, but changed tactics after police released a number of the suspects. It started apprehending suspects after dark, taking them by surprise, and beating confessions out of them before handing them over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the suspect hides information and there is strong evidence against him, a bit of sjamboking will be done to dig out the truth,&quot; the group's chair, Monthle Magolego, told the Mail &amp; Guardian. &quot;When they don't come out with the truth, they get a walloping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't encourage members to overdo the beating. But let me tell you, the criminal arrested by Mapogo - the one who is sjamboked - will never repeat the deeds, he'll be born-again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events leading to the death of the three &quot;suspects&quot; - the latest earlier this month - were unclear, Magolego said. He said they might have died due to &quot;ill health&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charley Nkadimeng, representative of the province's MEC for Safety and Security, Seth Ntai, expressed concern at the increasing popularity of vigilante justice in the province, saying three other vigilante groups were operating in the province and more were likely to emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be irresponsible of me to deny we do not have an effective police,&quot; Nkadimeng said. &quot;But we condemn vigilante activities, and our ministry is concerned about the reign of terror by this group.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mapogo commands widespread community support. Stickers supporting the group adorn business premises and people sport T- shirts bearing its logo, the head of leopard facing a tiger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents showered praise on the group this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martha Mabuthla, a mother of six, said last Christmas was the most peaceful she had seen in a decade. &quot;This place used to be rough, but since Mapogo was started we are living in peace,&quot; she said. &quot;Even the boys who used to commit crime are campaigning against it now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spaza owner Matsitsane Kumako said Mapogo had helped him arrest the men who had murdered his wife. Two years ago, Maggie Kumako was shot and killed by two gunmen in an armed robbery at the shop. Though the gunmen were identified by witnesses, and they were well known in the community, they remained on the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impatient and angry, Kumako went after the killers himself, with the backing of a 5 000-strong crowd under the banner of Magopo, caught them and handed them over to the police. The two have appeared in court and are still in custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though they publicly express their concern about the vigilantes, local police officers privately support them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sekhukhune station commander TM Mphati said crime, particularly burglaries and robberies, had plummeted since Mapogo was formed. But he disapproved of the group's methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We support some of their actions, such as the arrests they have made, but their other side is bad,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acting commander at the Nebo police station, David Mahlase, said Mapogo members &quot;are cancelling out their good work with the beating and killing of suspects&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not surprisingly, those who have been targeted by the vigilantes as suspects condemned their actions. Edward Ramphadi (22) has been in police custody since his arrest by Mapogo last week for allegedly attempting to kill one of its members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramphadi said he was woken up just after midnight by people banging on the door and shouting at him to come outside. &quot;When I got out I saw more than 10 cars with lights on. They told me of previous crimes I committed and then accused me of attempting to kill one of their members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The next moment I was being beaten with irons and sticks. They also poured petrol on me and one lit a match saying they would burn me if I don't admit it.&quot; He confessed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's sacked chief soccer coach, Shuaibu Amodu, has taken Sports Minister Jim Nwobodo and the country's Football Association to court for alleged wrongful dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a suit filed before a Federal High Court in Lagos by his lawyers, Tony Momoh and Company, Amodu is claiming five million naira (some 60,000 U.S.  dollars) in damages for his Jan. 27 sacking.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is demanding another one million naira (12,000 dollars) as unpaid claims. Hearing in the case begins Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amodu was fired by the association for breach of contract, after the association accused him of granting unauthorized media interviews critical of Nwobodo and the soccer administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crisis was fuelled by the association's decision to appoint a foreign technical adviser to Nigeria's national teams. Nwobodo insists a technical adviser must be hired before March to take Nigeria to its second World Cup appearance, scheduled for France in 1998.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Ugandan military authorities have accused Sudan of bombing the northern border town of Moyo Thursday, killing one woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Yoweri Museveni's military adviser for northern Uganda, Maj. Gen.  Salim Saleh, said Thursday in Kampala that two Soviet-era Mig fighters and an Antonov 26 dropped eight bombs in Moyo, five of which exploded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an unprovoked attack which deserves appropriate retaliation,&quot; he said. Saleh said aircraft had aimed at the Moyo military barracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The raid was the first on Uganda in 1997 by the Sudanese Air Force. It bombed the country several times the previous year. Thursday's attack occurred at a time when relations between Kampala and Khartoum are at their lowest ebb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan has blamed Uganda, Eritrea and Ethiopia of helping anti-government forces which have seized several locations in Sudans Blue Nile province.  Khartoum has accused these countries of being used by non-African powers to destabilise the Islamic-oriented government of Gen. Omar al Bashir.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The commander of the West African Peace Monitoring Force in Liberia, Maj. Gen. Victor Malu, told American diplomats Thursday that the remaining military capability and command structure of the country's warring factions had been removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Monrovia, Malu's press secretary, Biola Lawal, said the general was briefing Howard Jeters, the special envoy of United States President Bill Clinton, and the U.S. Ambassador to Liberia, William Milam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malu said most disarmed fighters and their commanders had left Liberia's remote hinterland and merged into the general population in towns and cities such as Monrovia, the capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malu said the peace monitor force, known more commonly as Ecomog, was determined to retrieve remaining weapons. The operation to do so started one week after the disarmament of warring parties January 31. This time lapse was designed to give guerrillas in isolated areas a chance to surrender their weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, Ecomog began what it called &quot;intensive military cordon and search operations&quot; to recover more weapons. So far, some 30,058 fighters have been disarmed, 14,156 guns and 1.65 million rounds of ammunition turned in. The number of bombs recovered now stand at 4,369.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malu said the United States had given &quot;tremendous logistics support&quot; which had greatly enhanced Ecomog's capabilities. However, he said more help was needed, particularly for the maintenance of Ecomog's vehicles, most of which were grounded due to lack of truck tires, batteries and other spares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeters assured the Malu that the U.S. would continue to help Ecomog. But Jester also sought clarification on various aspects of the peace process, particularly provision of adequate security for the success of the forthcoming election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a meeting Thursday with Wilner Servatius, the deputy chief of mission of the Netherlands Embassy in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, Malu noted that the Dutch government was helping Ghana and Mali send more troops to Liberia to reinforce the estimated 10,000 troops who make up Ecomog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional troops are needed to complete Ecomog's pacification drive. In addition, Malu said, the Netherlands had given Ecomog 82 7-ton trucks to support the force's logistics capability. However, Malu said further international help was needed to repair badly war-damaged bridges throughout the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Worried by the spate of bombings in the country in the recent months, Nigeria's military government has set up a presidential task-force comprising the armed forces, the police and security agents to investigate the terrorist acts, an official said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police commissioner for Lagos State, Abubakar Tsav told journalists in Lagos that the enlarged team of investigators was already assembling in the city. Their identities are being withheld for security reasons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria has recorded at least 10 bomb explosions since May 1995, with the last four blasts targeted at the military in Lagos. At least three people were killed and a score of others were injured in the separate explosions in Lagos. Seven people, including five soldiers were injured in the latest incident, Wednesday. Nigerian authorities have blamed the opposition groups led by the National Democratic Coalition (Nadeco), for the bombings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the groups have often denied the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is another military bus that was affected, so instead of blaming Nadeco, they should for once, look within,&quot; Abraham Adesanya, a Nadeco official, said. &quot;We haven't the money to buy bombs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adesanya, who escaped a recent attempt to kill him by unknown gunmen, was reacting to charges by government for Wednesday's explosion. Meanwhile, the Nigerian defence spokesman, Col. Godwin Ugbo, was quoted as having told reporters in Lagos Thursday that government was throwing its net open in the investigation. &quot;The military is not taking it lightly, if the perpetrators are within us, they will be uncovered and if they are being used, they will be caught one day,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest bombing happened three days into a nationwide voter-registration ahead of a scheduled March 15 local council elections in the country. The elections are part of a series under the government's transition to democracy, expected to end in October 1998.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi, Kenya (PANA) - Some 961 former employees of Kenya Airways, who were declared redundant six years ago, have sued the company and are demanding at least 3.5 billion Kenya shillings (63.64 million U.S. dollars) in compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of this, the Kenya News Agency reported Friday, 3.3 billion shillings (60 million dollars) is being claimed for loss of service, 200 million shillings (3.64 million dollars) in lieu of notice and 15 million shillings (272,727 dollars) as severance pay.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also claiming at least four million shillings for (72,727 dollars) accrued leave and another 10 million shillings (181,818 dollars) from the Provident Fund. The former employees sued the company through their lawyer, John Khaminwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency did not say when the plaintiffs sued the company. The complainants, who were declared redundant in May 1990, allege that Kenya Airways failed to comply with the country's employment act. Khaminwa says the dismissal of his clients was &quot;wrongful and in violation of the provisions dealing with redundancy under the employment act.&quot; The lawyer claims his clients had been deprived of the benefits to which they were entitled and as a result had suffered loss and damage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg, South Africa (PANA) - United States Vice-President Al Gore flies into South Africa on Friday for a three-day meeting which will examine progress in bilateral relations between the two countries. The meeting will also attempt to smooth troubled relations between the two countries resulting from a proposed South African arms sale to Syria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be the third meeting of the U.S.-South Africa Bi-National Commission which is co-chaired by Gore and South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting begins Saturday in Cape Town on Saturday. The Commission has six committees -- co-chaired by the relevant ministers of both countries.  Gore and Mbeki are expected to focus on foreign affairs in their one-on-one discussions. Their officials are sure that the proposed South African-Syrian arms deal will feature prominently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions between Washington and Pretoria surfaced in January when the United States warned South Africa against going ahead with a proposed 650- million U.S. dollar sale of a laser-guided tank-firing control system to Syria. South African President Nelson Mandela reacted strongly, saying Pretoria would make such decisions for itself and the U.S. warned that if the sale went through South Africa could lose 120 million dollars in U.S. aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this weekend's talks, Mbeki is expected to reiterate that his government had not yet taken a final decision regarding the sale and that once it does all interested parties, including the U.S., would be consulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gore is expected to reiterate his government's view that Syria has sponsored international terrorism and that South Africa should, therefore, refrain from doing business with that country. He is also expected to use the opportunity to raise Washington's concern about Pretoria's relations with Cuba, Libya and Iran.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The United Nations Security Council yesterday held an unprecedented meeting with non-governmental humanitarian agencies on the Great Lakes conflict. At an informal meeting, the agencies called on UN member states to exert political pressures on governments to secure protection for vulnerable populations, including displaced persons and refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a joint press release, following the meeting, OXFAM, CARE and Doctors without Borders said the agencies welcomed the &quot;historic oportunity&quot; to give first-hand accounts in their presentation on the Great Lakes. The press release sharply criticised the UN Security Council and UN member states, saying &quot;humanitarian action has been used as a substitute for political action&quot;. The agencies recommended that international diplomacy be made the first priority, by putting &quot;full political and diplomatic resources behind the search for a regional political settlement&quot;. It said the appointment of Joint UN/OAU Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region, Mohamed Sahnoun, was &quot;an opportunity to make real progress towards a regional political settlement&quot;. The International Committee of the Red Cross also made a presentation at the meeting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his briefing to the Security Council, OXFAM director David Bryer said that all too often &quot;partial measures&quot; were used to adress the crisis in the Great Lakes and that the &quot;UN Security Council and the UN member states have yet to demonstrate their commitment to a response commensurate with the scale of suffering in this region&quot;. He said that &quot;the enormity of recent horrors have tended to eclipse the fact that crises in the region stem from underlying causes that are both long established and complex&quot;. Calling for a lasting, durable political solution, Bryer said any solution must come from the region itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila said yesterday a regional heads of state summit on the Zaire crisis will be pointless without representation from his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL). In an interview in Bukavu, eastern Zaire, Kabila complained that no- one had so far consulted him or solicited his views on how to resolve the conflict: &quot;We are part of the Zaire game, yet no one bothers to invite us to regional meetings on Zaire...not inviting us to such a meeting does not and cannot solve the country's problems&quot; quotes Reuters. Rebel radio, Bukavu, Tuesday, broadcast Kabila reiterating an ultimatum to the Zairean government to start negotiations with ADFL by February 21. A regional summit, preceding an international conference, has been proposed by European Union Special Envoy Aldo Ajello earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel claims to have captured the strategic border town of Isiro late Tuesday were confirmed today by the Zairean military, reports AFP. Observers say the capture of Isiro - 575 kilometers northeast of the government stronghold of Kisangani, and close to the Uganda, Central African Republic and Sudan borders - gives rebels significant control of supply lines. Isiro has a major airport, which was fiercely defended by foreign mercenaries, journalists report. BBC today reported a claim by rebels that they had seized the town of Faradje, northeastern Zaire. A BBC correspondent in the region said the rebels were advancing on several fronts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya - who hosted two regional summits on the Great Lakes crisis - appealed yesterday to the United Nations, United States and the European Union to provide an intervention force. President Moi said the force should act as a buffer between Zaire and neighbouring countries, reported local media. Speaking in northwest Kenya during a public rally, President Moi said the world community must act fast to avert further bloodshed in the Great Lakes region. President Moi also denounced the ADFL rebels for &quot;recruiting child soldiers&quot;. In an interveiw with AFP, rebel spokesman Raphael Ghenda rejected Moi's proposal, saying Moi was partisan and showed support for Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Ugandan President Yoweri said yesterday after talks with French President Jacques Chirac that he did not believe an international conference would bring any quick solution to the Great Lakes crisis. France has made urgent calls for an international conference to resolve the situation in Zaire.  Museveni described such a conference as a &quot;medium or long-term arrangement&quot; and called for &quot;more specific&quot; measures, reports Reuters from Paris. He said a more immediate solution would be to empower Mohamed Sahnoun to mediate a cease-fire between Zaire and the ADFL rebels, and said Sahnoun should be backed by &quot;some political heavy weight&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A representative of Kabila's ADFL rebel group, Gaetan Kakudji, is in Paris, and has met several French officials to discuss the Zairean crisis, reports AFP. Gaetan Kakudji told AFP that the rebel group was keen &quot;to destroy the image that the alliance is hostile to France&quot; and said the message had been &quot;well received&quot; by the French. Kakudji said he had met Africa specialists from both the French foreign ministry and the presidency.  These contacts between the rebels and the French government are believed to be the first. Gaetan Kakudja, who is in charge of foreign affairs and development aid for the ADFL and is sometimes referred to as its &quot;foreign minister&quot;, met last week with Mohamed Sahnoun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomatic sources in Europe told IRIN that the French government was well informed of the visit by Museveni and rebel representative Gaetan Kakudji, but that the visit of Kakudji was not official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda's state-owned New Vision newspaper reported today that Ugandan insurgents and the Zairean rebels have been engaged in heavy fighting on the Zairean side of the border. The Ugandan West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) fought Zairean rebels at Ariwara, 12 kilometres inside the Zairean border, reported the newspaper. Ugandan authorities say the WNBF operates from bases inside Zaire, and is believed to be fighting alongside Zairean government troops.  The Zairean government says it is holding captive survivors from a Ugandan cargo plane carrying military equipment and troops which was reported to have crashed inside Zaire's borders. A statement by Zairean Defence Ministry said in a communique on Tuesday that the plane was &quot;further proof of the involvement of the regular Ugandan army in the war&quot;. A Ugandan army spokesman has denied the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The World Food Programme confirms that some 2,000 Zairean refugees have arrived by barge in Mpulungu, Zambia, from areas south of Kalemie. Seven hundred Sudanese refugees who were previously staying in Dungu, southeastern Zaire, have arrived in Central African Republic (CAR) over the last few weeks.  UN sources confirmed the displaced Sudanese refugees were in Mboki, CAR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan summoned yesterday top officials of the international war crimes tribunal on Rwanda following the release of the highly critical internal investigations of mismanagement. The Secretary-General is expected to call the chief prosecutor, deputy prosecutor and registrar to New York in the next ten days. The spokesman for the Secretary-General, Fred Eckhard said Annan felt &quot;let down by the lapses in administration which occurred not only in the field but at headquarters&quot;. The chief prosecutor of the UN court is Canadian Louise Arbour. The tribunal's Arusha, Tanzania-based registrar is Andronico Adede of Kenya, and Honore Rakotomanana of Madagascar is the deputy prosecutor based in the Rwandan capital, Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee (RSCC) on Burundi is meeting today in Lusaka, Zambia; the meeting is scheduled to last one day.  The RSCC is expected to be strongly petitioned by those opposed to continued sanctions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - COSATU held its first ordinary meeting of the Executive Committee (EXCO) in Johannesburg from 11 - 12 February. Reports were received on a range of issues including the restructuring of state assets, situation in Swaziland, Employment Standards Bill, COSATU 6th National Congress, May Day and Campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Situation in Swaziland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXCO received an update report on the situation in Swaziland where four Trade Union leaders have been arrested and charged under Swazi draconian law and will appear in court on 13 February 1997. A further report on the meeting held with the SADC Chairperson, President Mandela was also made. After deliberations, the EXCO resolved as follows;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* To call for the immediate and unconditional release of the four trade unionists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The creation of a climate conducive to free political activity * The repeal and ammendment of the LRA to be compatible with ILO Conventions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The lifting of the state of emergency on repressive sections as contained in the 1963 and 1973 laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Supported the position of the SFTU that the strike will not be called off until their leaders have been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Agreed to participate in SATUCC and ICFTU missions to Swaziland respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* To embark on a one day protest action by refusing to handle goods to and from Swaziland, and for regions near the border to hold demonstrations at the border. This will include retail and transport sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Employmenst Standards Bill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU received an update on the negotiations with government and business on the Employment Standards Bill including discussion the Secretariat had with comrade Tito Mboweni. We further received reports from our affiliates on the options which had been put forward during the negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting re-iterated its position on: Six months marternity of which at least four months must be paid, phased approach to 40 hour week, with clear time frames for its achievement, no downward variation, children of less than 16 years should not work and that Sunday work must be paid in terms of the status quo with extensions to all workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting further agreed to develop a programme of action aimed at mobilising our own members and supporting the negotiations propcess. In this regard it was resolved that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A meeting with the ANC should be sought as a matter of urgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* That NEDLAC should be informed of our intention to embark on the following programme of action:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">21 February 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Negotiation Campaigns bulletin covering all the areas of disagreements will be distributed reaching every worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">22 - 23 February</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional Executive Committees and Regional Shopsteward Councils will meet to decide on forms of protest actions appropriate to their regions and locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">24 Feb - 05 March</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activities in all industrial areas. These will include pickets, marches and rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10 - 20 March 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU affiliates will lead marches, demonstrations or pickets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">24 March - 06 April</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rallies and Marches in major centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7 - 10 April</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU Central Executive Committee will meet in its ordinary session. Part of its agenda would be to evaluate the negotiations process on the above issues. If no sufficient progress has been made, a general strike planned for the 12 May will be sanctioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our members have been mandated to work for the success of the strike if it goes ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Restructuring of State Assets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU has noted with concern that despite the committment as outlined by President Mandela to the NFA in parliament, some Ministers are taking decisions on issues and making announcements outside of the six aside meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We re-iterate our committment to debate the restructuring of state assets in line with the NFA and with our CEC resolutions. We however will not standby and watch government ministers deliberately sidelining the labour movement on areas of restructuring. Any attempt to move ahead out of the NFA agreement would be resisted by workers organised within COSATU. We will be evaluating the success or otherwise of current the discussions within the sectors and will decide on an appropriate action at the labour caucus to be held on the 3 March 1997. We also intend to raise these matters with Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. May Day Activities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXCO mandated the National Office Bearers to plan May Day activities taking into account the need to maximum participation by workers and their families.  In this regard we have been asked to look at the combination of decentralised and centralised activities. The theme for this year is: &quot;JOBS, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL PROGRESS&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Masakhane Campaign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXCO endorsed the new Masakhane campaign. Our view is that so far the campaign has focused on the payment of services only and neglecting other areas of concern to communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The direction as outlined by the ANC, is for people participating in drawing budgets and having a say in the development of their local areas. The COSATU leadership will participate alongside the Alliance leaders in this campaign starting on the 21March 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. CRIME</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the International Women's Day ( 8/03/97) COSATU will hold marches through-out the country to focus on violence against women, child abuse and domestic violence and other crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issues that will be addressed in those marches will also include other rights of women. (six months maternity and 40 hour working hours a week).  Regions will also be encouraged to arrange activities beyond this day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister of Safety and Security will be requested along side our President to launch this campaign. We do not believe that all issues related to crime will take us any further. South Africans have a responsible to join hands with the government on this matter. We will also ask our shop stewards to participate in Community Policing Forum and working with all law enforcements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Domestic Workers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EXCO took a decision to investigate the feasibility of establishing advice centres for domestic workers. An update report will be tabled at the CEC in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea is to find a workable way of organising and servicing domestic workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. NEDLAC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU affiliates forwarded new names for participation in NEDLAC the list is attached. Conveners were agreed as Muzi Buthelezi, Randall Howard, Andre Kriel and Herbert Mkhize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Discussion Document on the Alliance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXCO received report backs on discussion on the document from affiliates.  It was agreed that discussions within structures and with the Alliance must continue. This must take into account proposals on areas such as Housing and Infrastructure, National Health, Social welfare net, land reform, Public transport and Government job creation strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coming CEC will deal with these issues extensively. The idea is to isolate areas for the CEC, Congress and the Alliance Summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. National Retirement Fund</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was informed of meetings convened by the Minister of Finance on retirement funds. It was agreed that the Federation need to seek representation and to co-ordinate the matter effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXCO took a decision that the issue of the Retirement fund should be considered as part of a social wage with focus on the National health care, maternity leave, pension and transport, retirement etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Regulation of the Oil Industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EXCO was disturbed by the statement attributed to comrade Pennuel Maduna - the Minister for Minerals and Energy on the oil industry. He is reported to be supportive of the deregulation on the oil industry. We hope that he was misquoted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As COSATU we are opposed to the deregulation of the oil industry. We prefer re-regulation of the industry taking into account our goals of employment creation, access to liquid fuels etc. The government should know by now that the reason why the Taxi industry is in a chaotic state was the deregulation of that industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We intend to request an urgent meeting with Comrade Maduna to address this matter. We also believe that whatever proposals he has, should be tabled at the liquids fuel task team in NEDLAC.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said yesterday that he regrets the dismantling of the multinational force for eastern Zaire at the end of 1996. At a press conference at the United Nations, New York, Annan said the plight of refugees in the region was &quot;tragic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it would have been better to suspend and eventually reactivate the Canadian-led force created last November rather than abandoning it: &quot;In retrospect, the multinational force should not have been disbanded&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Secretary-General said it was very difficult to assemble a peace- keeping force: &quot;In the absence of the willing and the will, there is very little the UN can do in terms of putting in a force&quot;. A multinational force was mandated by the UN Security Council in November, but the United States and Canada said their troops would avoid using force. After over a million Rwandan refugees spontaneouly returned to Rwanda from eastern Zaire in November, advance teams of US and Canadan troops eventually withdrew after minimal logistical preparations and air surveillance missions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya called for an international force to be deployed in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Talks between Joint UN/OAU Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region, Mohamed Sahnoun, the Kenyan Foreign Affairs Minister Kalonzo Musyoka, and European Union envoy Aldo Ajello were held in Nairobi on Tuesday. The Kenyan Daily Nation reports today that in the talks they agreed with the Pretoria proposal (January 30 1997) that a ministerial delegation proceed to Kinshasa &quot;as quickly as possible&quot; in preparation for a regional summit. The Presidents of Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe were mandated by the Nairobi II summit (December 16-17 1996) to act on behalf of all leaders in the region regarding peace inititives in the Great Lakes crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been numerous calls for a regional conference which has widespread support, but no date or venue has yet been proposed. The first two regional summits were hosted by President Daniel arap Moi in Nairobi; but after Moi visited Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko in his Gbadolite home (January 6 1997) and called on rebels to cease hostilities and withdraw to facilitate negotiations, rebel representatives denounced Moi as partisan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, Erik Derycke, called for intervention in Zaire &quot;without taking one side or another&quot;. In an interview in the Belgian weekly &quot;Le Vif/L'Express&quot; published today, the Minister issued a stinging denunciation of &quot;indifference&quot; shown by the European Union, the United Nations and the United States towards the crisis in the Great Lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila has accused the Zairean army of using Tingi-Tingi as an operations and supply base for the conflict, reported CNN today. Kabila earlier in the week gave assurances that he would keep his troops away from Tingi-Tingi, which holds at least 120,000 Rwandans. World Food Programme reports at least another 35,000 refugees in so-called &quot;Tingi- Tingi 2&quot;, about five kilometres from the bigger camp. This group is described by agencies as being in considerably worse condition. According to UNICEF statistics, the death rate is very high - on February 12, 39 people died, of which 20 were children under five. Aid workers say amalgamation of the two groups is being resisted in &quot;Tingi-Tingi 2&quot; by leaders who want to retain control over refugee food distribution. Refugees in &quot;Tingi-Tingi 2&quot; recently fled from Amisi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Representatives from Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Zaire and Zambia concluded a two-day meeting of the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee today in Lusaka, Zambia, reports Reuters. A government official said in Lusaka that the meeting closed in this afternoon but had issued no statement: &quot;it is all hush-hush&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burundian government on Thursday appealed again for regional sanctions to be lifted. A statement from the Burundian foreign ministry said the country had been suffering &quot;from a total blockade for seven months that was imposed unjustly and illegally by neighbouring countries&quot;. The government complained in the statement that &quot;disadvantaged populations continue to be seriously affected by the perverse effects of the blockade&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Health Organization representative for Burundi, Dr Bernard Lala, told IRIN today that the health situation in Burundi was &quot;worsening&quot;, and that there was an epidemic of typhus in four provinces - Muramuya, Bujumbura, Gitega and Kayanza. The representative said the number of typhus cases since October 1996 had soared because of the unhygenic conditions in camps for &quot;re- grouped&quot; populations. Since the government started putting populations from rebel-affected areas into camps, there has been a rise in malaria, diarrhoea, respiratory tract infections and malnutrition. According to Dr Lala, some 200, 000 people had been &quot;re-grouped&quot;, after some 500,000 were dispersed by the army. He said disease was due to poor sanitation, and the absence of clean water, decent shelter and food - typhus is carried by rats and body lice. WHO have so far recorded 802 cases of typhus between October 1996 and early January 1997; there are also cases of cholera. Dr Lala warned that it was likely that problems would continue because they wre linked to the social and political situation; he also warned that where &quot;re-grouping&quot; denied farmers access to land, international assistance would be needed to cope with crop shortages. Dr Lala expressed concern that regional sanctions impaired quick responses to health problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An FAO (UN Food and Agriculture Organisation) study shows a wide variation in changes of prices of agricultural goods and other consumer items in Burundi since the takeover in July 1996. Prices of most goods have increased, says the report, and some prices have more than doubled. The price of diesel has increased by 233% and the price of petrol has gone up by 263%. Regional sanctions were imposed on July 31st 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* International Non-Governmental Organisations working in Rwanda issued a statement on February 11 condemning recent attacks on members of the international community and extended condolences to both Rwandan and international victims. The International NGO Forum in Rwanda said it was concerned that such attacks were intended to discourage international assistance to the people of Rwanda, but reaffirmed members' committment to assisting the people of Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven more killings in Rwanda have been reported. State-run Rwandan radio said yesterday that unidentified gunmen attacked the Burgomaster of Ndusu commune, Ruhengeri prefecture, Jean-Pierre Nyionzima, killing him and three others. It also reported the killing of three genocide survivors in the same prefecture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata arrived in Kigoma, Tanzania today to visit Zairean refugees. Mrs Ogata left Kampala today and will fly to Dar es Salaam tomorrow. About 20,000 Zairean refugees are in camps in the western Tanzanian port; 60,000 Zaireans reportedly fled to Tanzania since the conflict in eastern Zaire started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni yesterday proposed that a permanent observer team be deployed along the Zaire-Uganda border to check Zairean allegations that Ugandan troops are involved in the conflict. After holding talks with the UNHCR High Commissioner yesterday, Museveni reportedly pressed Ogata to get assurances of safe passage for refugees and UN staff from rebel leader Kabila and the Kinshasa authorities. He said at a news conference that France was &quot;wrong&quot; to propose that negotiations should only involve &quot; legitimate governments&quot; and not the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The northern Ugandan border town of Moyo was bombed by three Sudanese planes on Thursday; one woman was killed. The state-run New Vision newspaper reported one Antonov and two Russian MiG jet fighters dropping eight bombs between an army barracks and Moyo town. Ugandan Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya said it would put &quot;further strain&quot; on relations between Kampala and Khartoum, report AFP. Ugandan border towns have periodically suffered bombing since Sudanese rebels captured neighbouring territory in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Excerpts from the Zairean press include a claim by &quot;La Reference&quot; - considered an opposition paper - that Belgian mercenary leader Tavernier and some of his men have left Zaire &quot;for an unknown destination&quot;. The paper claimed he left after a tactical dispute with General Mahele over the mercenaries' &quot;archaic methods&quot; which were hindering the success of the army.  Le Soft - which is considered neutral - reported that rebel leader Kabila had confirmed that Ugandan and Rwandan troops were fighting with rebel forces because &quot;ethnic solidarity&quot; transcended regional boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Correction: Due to a typographical error in Update 99, IRIN wrongly attributed a recent report on human rights in Burundi to the UNHCR. The report was of course written by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) Field Operation in Burundi, HRFOB. IRIN regrets the error.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - Although the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee (RSCC ) is expected to meet next week to discuss the sanctions against Burundi, former Tanzania President Julius Nyerere, and other influential voices in the region have given few indications that they are prepared to recommend that the sanctions be removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A request from the humanitarian community for a second allocation of fuel is expected to be one of the major topics of discussion. Since the imposition of the sanctions, international humanitarian organizations have only received one shipment of fuel. Those reserves have been depleted, and essential programs reduced. Agencies are now being forced to consider reducing their emergency relief operations even further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanzanian National Sanctions Committee has given WFP permission to import a very limited quality of fuel on behalf of the UN and NGO community, but the quantity agreed to is only a portion of the quantity needed. The Tanzanians gave permission to import the limited supplies as a stop gap measure until the February 9 RSCC meeting, but supplies must travel by road and their arrival is expected to be delayed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. GENERAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the next meeting of the RSCC under a week away, President Buyoya continues his efforts to convince those countries enforcing the sanctions to remove them. There are few indications, however, that his efforts will be successful. On January 29, President Buyoya met with Rwandan authorities in Kigali. On February 3, he met with international mediators in Arusha. It was in Arusha, just days after last July's coup, that east African leaders imposed sanctions. In a meeting organized by former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, Buyoya put his case to OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim, UN Special Representative to Burundi Marc Faguy, European Union envoy to the Great Lakes Aldo Ajello,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US Special Envoy Howard Wolpe and a representative of South African President Nelson Mandela. Nyerere has been trying to broker an end to the conflict in Burundi for over a year. Following the meeting, Nyerere admitted to reporters that he had made little progress and added that he was &quot; beginning to feel that he was providing an umbrella for the killings.&quot; Nyerere said that he favoured maintaining economic sanctions. &quot;If you remove the pressure of sanctions what will be in place? Pressure is necessary,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;The killings have not stopped. Conditions are worse in Burundi than they were in July,&quot; he added. Ajello told reporters that the behaviour of the authorities in Burundi had not encouraged the international community to back the lifting of sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hutu rebels and the Burundi military have killed at least 1,100 people in Burundi over the last two months, according to a January 29 report published by the UN Human Rights office in Burundi. The report said that civilians had been the main victims in killings by both sides in the more than 50 reported incidents between December 1 and January 22. In one of the largest single incidents, the report claims that more than 700 people were killed in northwest Kayanza province on December 2 and 3. It added that at least 150 people were killed in separate incidences in Bubanza, Bujumbura and Cibitoke provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 3, some 2,250 male students from Bujumbura headed for military camps throughout the country for military training that became compulsory last month. The students were sent to four camps Mutukura, in the east, Mwaro and Muramvya in central Burundi and Mabanda camp in the south. Female conscripts are scheduled to begin training next week. The military service includes a three month training course, followed by nine months in the field .  Approximately 3,000 first and second year university students are also expected to participate in the military service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trials of approximately 80 people accused of taking part in massacres that followed a failed military coup in 1993 could begin as early as next month. Interviewed by local journalists, Minister of Justice Gervais Rubashamuheto said February 3 that 13 suspects were already in prison in Burundi while many others had escaped abroad. The minister said that next week judicial authorities will issue arrest warrants against suspects still in country, or place them under house arrest. Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was murdered Oct. 21, 1993, three months after being elected President. The putsch attempt by Tutsi members of the military, sparked an upsurge of ethnic massacres by both sides which left tens of thousands dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government organized four day conference, billed as a national debate, on the roots of the conflict in Burundi and ways to restore peace, ended January 31 with many of the 60 delegates from Tutsi political parties divided on how to stop the war. Excerpts of the debate have been broadcast nightly on local television. Hutu dominated political parties boycotted the debate while the FDD, the political arm of the CNDD, rebel movement was not invited. The Buyoya government had hoped that fulfilling its promise to organize a national conference on the conflict in Burundi would lead to a relaxation of economic sanctions. Referring to the debate, Nyerere said that it was a good idea but that it did not allow for open and honest dialogue. &quot;He (Buyoya) is keeping other people out, there is tremendous harassment of the opposition.  Under those circumstances, how do you conduct a useful national debate?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to AFP, unnamed religious sources have told UN officials that 1, 500 civilians were massacred January 5 in Muramvya province. In a January 31 story filed from Geneva, the wire service said that human rights observers who visited the province last week were unable to confirm or refute the claims. The CNDD, the main Hutu rebel group, claimed last month that 275 people had been killed by the army in Rutegama province by the military on the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Ministers from six African countries have pledged to Burundi to help work towards comprehensive peace in the Great Lakes region. In a January 27-28 meeting in Pretoria between Foreign Ministers of Congo, Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, the ministers called on all countries and foreign nationals to refrain from military involvement in Zaire which could lead to a further escalation of hostilities. The foreign ministers agreed to visit Zaire at the earliest opportunity, and that that visit should be followed by visits to Rwanda and Uganda as well as Burundi. All three countries have been accused by the Zairian government, and have denied it themselves, of supporting the rebels in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. SECURITY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few security incidents were reported over the past week, although the UN security team cautions that the lack of reports may reflect the paucity of reliable information as much as an improvement of security throughout the country. A January 30 interagency assessment mission to Mugina commune in Cibitoke province was able to get only as far as Rugombo, 20 km to the southwest. Reports indicate that there were on-going skirmishes within the commune between military forces and Hutu rebels. One report indicated that military forces attempting to repair the commune's water system came under rebel attack, leading to at least four casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of instability continue in Bubanza Province. In one recent attack, over 200 cattle were stolen and the health centre in Ninga ransacked. Four of those responsible for the attack were killed by military forces. In this attack, as in others, it is unclear if it was perpetuated by Hutu rebels or a simple act of banditry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. AFFECTED POPULATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interagency assessment missions to Cibitoke continue with humanitarian agencies exploring the feasibility of resuming limited operations in the province. Following the assassination of 3 International Committee of the Red Cross delegates in the province in June, agencies stayed out of the province until limited assessments missions were restarted in November following the repatriation to the province of tens of thousands of Burundians formerly in refugee camps in eastern Zaire. WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR, DHA, UNOPS, FAO, ECHO and Oxfam Quebec participated in a January 30 mission to the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mission reported that the Ndava site in Buganda commune now is home to between 6,330 to 8,830 affected individuals. Out of that population, 3,327 are returnees from eastern Zaire while the remaining 3,000 to 5,000 are displaced. Apart from a one time distribution of food and non-food relief items by UNHCR, returnees have received limited assistance from international NGOs but are still in generally poor health. IHA is in the process of establishing a health center, and also plans to open a nutritional center.  Signs of malnutrition were evident among the children, and residents of the site had no access to potable water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR and WFP estimate that the number of affected people in Cibitoke province is up to 105,000 of which anywhere between 60,000 and 80,000 were returnees. Immediately following the mass exodus from Zaire, most returnees congregated in sites along the province's main road. Now three months later, many returnees have returned to their home communities. In an attempt to help returnees resume their lives in Cibitoke and to help other vulnerable individuals, Oxfam Quebec will distribute seeds to 10,000 families in Mugina, Rugombo and Buganda communes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 4, DHA and WFP conducted a joint assessment of sites in Muramvya province. As the government pushes ahead with plans to regroup populations in war affected areas into designated sites, the mission visited the Rutegama regroupment site in western Muramvya. Administrators of the site told mission participants that 2,461 residents were currently at the site with approximately ten new people arriving each day. People are housed in empty, ramshackle administrative structures and sleep on mats on the floor.  Men and women sleep in separate, but nearby buildings. The administrator spoke of a large scale government construction program with the aim of creating &quot;villages&quot; that would include the establishment of health centres and schools. Although the construction program may infer the government intends the site to have a semi-permanent status, the site administrator said inhabitants would be allowed to return as the security situation improves in the hills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mission participants reported that site inhabitants have access to land and leave the site in groups of ten to fifteen at 7 am each morning to work in their fields. The groups are accompanied by armed soldiers. Seeds were reported to be in short supply and fertilizer too expensive for most inhabitants of the site to afford. With most able bodied individuals in the fields, only the sick, the elderly and some children were at the site when the mission visited. The site has one water tap which is currently not working. Residents must fetch their water from a spring 600 metres away.  There is a small health centre on the site with limited medical supplies.  Military authorities have also created at least two additional regroupment sites in Muramvya, each containing between 6,000 to 9,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mission participants in a January 29-31 joint ActionAid - DHA mission to Ruyigi province report that security in the Moso region of the province had improved dramatically since reports of heavy fighting in the area in late 1996. However, food security in the region has now become an issue. The production of certain crops in the most recent harvest was extremely low.  Production of beans, a staple, has been particularly hard hit with the price of seeds in the local market now four times more than the price the previous season. Livestock herds have also suffered from the insecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Burundian miliary forces pursued Hutu rebels who had crossed the country from camps in Zaire in November - December, 1996, at least 60,000 people were forced to flee the Moso and seek refuge in Tanzania.  Approximately half of these are estimated to have returned since then, but with considerable difficulty and loss of possessions. Some returnees claim that soldiers in Tanzania tried to prevent them from returning, or relieved them of their belongings before allowing them to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ActionAid is using a housing reconstruction program to promote peace and reconciliation in the province, and to encourage people to leave displaced sites and return to their communes of origin. Through the program, which depends on community dialogue and cooperation, over 500 houses have either been rebuilt or rehabilitated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. IMPACT OF SANCTIONS ON HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzanian authorities have given humanitarian organizations operating in Burundi permission to import additional supplies of fuel. The supplies, which include 100,000 litres of diesel. 50,000 litres of petrol and 25,000 litres of kerosene. The fuel has yet to arrive, and quantity is only a portion of what was originally requested. The fuel may have to be transported by road, not barge, increasing the delays even further. Until adequate new supplies arrive, agencies's humanitarian activities will continue to be adversely affected. There are indications that the RSCC will stipulate monthly quotas for the next round of fuel supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the request of the UN InterAgency Standing Committee, and with the financial support of a number of UN agencies, consultants from Brown University, the University of Notre Dame and the Fourth Freedom Forum are preparing a report on the humanitarian impact of the economic sanctions in Burundi and are currently in Burundi gathering data.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (EH/ENA) - Workers of the Ethiopia Tourist Trading Enterprise overwhelmingly supported on Monday the efforts of coordinating committee to reorganize the Confederation of Ethiopian Trade Unions(CETU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a general assembly of the basic union of ETTE, workers examined the failures of the former leaders of CETU to live up to the objectives of the confederation. Ato Wondemagegn Moges, representative of the Industrial Federation of Tourism, Hotels and General Service Workers, blamed the ex- leaders of CETU for engaging in self-interest pursuit and vying for the power.  He said that CETU should be reorganized in a way that it would work towards the realization of labour rights and other fringe benefits.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ato Wondwosen the former leaders of CETU had achieved virtually not due to their confrontational approach towards the government. &quot; Their approach was too confrontational that it was dangerous for the maintenance of industrial peace,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - The Special Public Prosecutor's Office (SPO) announced here yesterday that it has at long last charged a total of 5,198 alleged perpetrators of the Derg regime mainly with genocide and war crimes and alternatively with aggravated homicide and wilful injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special Prosecutor General Girma Wakijira told a press conference which he called at his office that 2,246 of the defendants in detention were charged while the remaining 2,952 were indicted in absentia. Five thousand twenty six are male and the remaining 172 constitute female defendants it was reported.  According to the SPO chief, 26 of the defendants were charged with aggravated homicide and 54 others with war crimes while the rest will have to face charges of genocide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The defendants are classified into three major groups: the first group constitute the policy or decision makers, the second group are the field commanders(those who transmitted the orders of the first group and also originate fresh orders of their own) and the third group make up the perpetrators of the crime,&quot; Ato Girma pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On hundred forty sic of the defendants belong to the first group, 2,433 to the second group and 2,619 fall in the third category, it was noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPO reportedly compiled concrete evidences on crimes committed against 14,209 victims. Of these, 1,837 are victims of torture, 8,752 are victims of killings and 978 victims of enforced disappearance, the SPO chief said, adding that 2,611 are victims of war crime while 31 are murder cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to the distribution of the charges, 202 defendants are to be tried in Tigray Regional State, 508 in the Amhara Regional State, 855 in Oromia, 421 in the southern Peoples' Region, 198 in Harari and 74 in Somali regional states. The rest f the defendants will be tried at the Federal High Court her, it was learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also stated that over 3,000 personal witness and large volumes of documentary evidences, audiovisuals, forensic and other expert-evidences are ready to prove the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing his office's performance so as far as a &quot;conspicuous achievement&quot; , Ato Girma said that it was unfortunate that the SPO and the Ethiopian prosecution process was blamed for delay. &quot;a compartive study begining from the Nuremberg Trial down to the different Truth Commissions and Inquiry Commissions that were established all over the world would make this criticism unfair if not unjust.&quot; Ato Girma's conviction appeared to be that achievements have to be weighed on the basis of the complexity of the mandate, the resources available, the support extended, and the progress made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are using our national law, national courts, prosecutors and defence lawyers for all these cases. This in our opinion is a major breakthrough,&quot; he underscored; adding &quot;this process, we are sure, is the basis for an established sequence of state accountability and a great fight against impunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a mandate to conduct investigation in to and institute proceedings against Derg/WPE regime perpetrators, the SPO was established in August 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Present were members of the diplomatic community, various NGO representatives and representatives of the victims, in addition to local and international newsmen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Meles Zenawi last week submitted to parliament his regular six-monthly report, covering a wide range of issues, with a particular focus on the development front. He meanwhile elaborately answered a number of questions raised by several MPs. Following is a condensed version of the major issues of the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As clearly put in the five-year government development strategy, expanding social and economic infrastructure is one of the four major roles which the federal government has to play in actualizing the development programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A look at this year's capital budget breakdown shows that the government has given particular attention to infrastructural expansion as provided by the strategy itself.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government, this year, allocated 4.8 billion birr in capital budget, a figure which reportedly exceeded that of last year by 21.6%. Of this, 25% went for the construction of new roads and reinforcement of existing ones; 13% for energy development; 10.5% for water resource development; 9.9% for the expansion of educational services; 8.7% for the expansion of transport and communications services; 7.4% for agricultural development and 6.5% for the expansion of health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the lion's share went to the road projects is indicative of the dire situation which the sector finds itself in, and the direct impact it will have on the overall economy of the country. This was so expressed in the words of the prime minister who described the country's transportation expenses as &quot;among the highest in he world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the education and health sectors got a relatively smaller portion of the budget, on the other hand, does not insinuate disregard of the two sectors. Rather, it was deliberately done in realisation of the fact that 80% of the former and 96% of the latter are the responsibilities of Regional States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ato Meles, the federal government's five-year plan pertaining to expansion of roads was: the reinforcement of 2613 Kms of existing asphalted road and the construction of 3833 Kms. of rural roads in various regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The successful completion of this 13-billion birr project, described by the PM as &quot;the biggest ever in the country's history&quot; is widely believed to meaningfully minimize the prevailing acute transportation problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, 26 designing and feasibility study projects have been formed, of which 12 are believed to be fianalized this year and the remaining 14 by next year. The Premier was sure that the EU - funded asphalt reinforcement work on the Addis Ababa - Jimma and Addis Ababa - Awassa roads would begin next year. If things go according to plan, five additional World Bank -funded projects would also begin actual work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To put maintenance programmes on a stable ground, Ato Meles disclosed that the legal framework for the establishment of a &quot;Road Maintenance Fund&quot;, a fund capable of generating its own income, was being laid down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implementation of this huge project obviously requires a strong capacity which the country doesn't have at the moment. The premier said that an all out effort is being exerted to build the necessary capacity. to this effect, restructuring the High Way Authority was well underway, manpower training programmes are going on both here and abroad. particularly the newly established engineering faculties in Bahir Dar and Makalle as well as the 25 junior technical training centres spanning the country are believed to be of great help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As regard the goal set for the current fiscal year and the actual work done on the ground, Ato Meles had to say these: &quot;The plan was to construct 310 Kms.  of new asphalt road and 293 Kms. of feeder gravel road. until early December, 58.4 Kms. of asphalt and 78 Kms. of gravel roads have been constructed. the rainy season took the blame for the delay and the hope is to compensate these in the months ahead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Meles commended the Ethiopian Telecommunications Authority (ETA) for a job well done where expansion of telecommunications service is concerned. According to the PM, the Authority has already begun, operating profit-mindedly, and that the government allotted no budget for it this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From its own income and loans, the ETA this year allocated 228 million birr for the expansion of its services and things are progressing satisfactorily.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If things continue to proceed as planned and if the Authority maintains its present level of efficiency, the Premier hoped that the country will be changed for the better in 2 to 3 years where telecommunications service is concerned. According to him, the plan is to add 480,000 new telephone lines to the existing 160,000 and to connect at least 300 rural towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Meles hinted that the ETA may in the very near future supply Addis and its surroundings with mobile phones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airport expansion is the other area deemed crucial where infrastructure development is concerned. This, the Prime Minister noted, is in recognition of the fast transportations services it renders, the role it plays in expanding the tourism industry as well as in safeguarding the country's air territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, reinforcement and maintenance works on the asphalted Dire Dawa and Bahir Dar Air Ports had been completed and some works have been going on on the Gambella and Gode air ports to enable them host civilian air crafts as well. Similarly, the actual work to provide the Bole International air Port with a new runway and a terminal was about to begin, Ato Meles noted, adding that new asphalted airport construction projects have been under way at Arba Minch, Gondar, Lalibella, Axum and Makale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Included in the report were projects on electric power generation and distribution. it was reported that 17 electric power generation and distribution projects have been running on a 211 million birr budget. As regards power generation, special attention was paid to the Gilgel Gibe, and the Aluto Geothermal generator project. Both are progressing well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister disclosed that the study phase for the establishment of a second generation station at the Tis Abay had been completed and the actual work put to auction. Renovation works are also reported to have been well under way on the Koka, Tis Abay 1 and Fincha hydro-power generation stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to electric power distribution, the report said that several installation projects are well underway, with Bahir Dar-Northern Ethiopia and Gedeo-Nekempte-Gimbi lines as the main ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Meles said that the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority (EELPA) still relies on government will stop its subsidy in 12 months time and that the Authority will have to enforce tariff adjustments to cover at least its expenses.&quot; The ultimate direction, he indicated, is that EELPA will have to emulate the ETA and work profit-mindedly. The legal frameworks for this are being laid down, it was learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harnessing the country's water resource also got due consideration form the government. This year alone, 597.5 million birr has been invested in water resource development projects which included master plan study on river basins, irrigation schemes as well as potable water projects, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While masterplan studies on Omo, Baro and Akobo river basin have already been accomplished the case with the Abay and Tekeze is a little bit behind schedule. These rivers reportedly accounted for 80% of the country's water resource. The finalization of these projects is believed to bring about a major change in the county's water resource utilization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As stated above the share of the federal government in the expansion of educational services is only 20%. And this is limited only to the administration of institutions of higher learning. According to the report, several new and existing colleges and universities have begun offering degree programmes in various disciplines as of this year. For example, the newly opened Dilla College offers programmes in medical science as well as teachers' training in eight subjects, Bahir Dar College in four engineering departments as well as teachers training in over eight subjects; Makalle University in two engineering departments; Alemaya University in medical science and teacher's training in various subjects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several MPs asked various questions which the MP answered elaborately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked on whether or not there was any development in the Ethio-Sudanese relations and on allegations of occasional skirmish between armies of the two countries, Ato Meles said the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our relations with the Sudanese government has shown no progress over the months. It's as worse as it was since recent times. As to the skirmish, it's simply a lie. All the vociferating and the call for an army moblizations, all the beating of war drums and all the accusations on the part of the Sudanese government are mere propaganda to get domestic support by externalizing internal problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to our position we don't want to shoot a single bullet no matter how fierce the provocation may be. We've had enough shooting for years and our major, perhaps the only, preoccupation is ploughing the land and harvesting maize. To put it succinctly, the Sudanese government won't invade us because it very well knows its military capacity, and we'll not provoke the Sudanese government because it's against our principle of promoting fraternal relations with our neighbours and because the time now is for harvesting food rains and not for shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As to our solidarity with the generous and hospitable people of the Sudan, it will remain intact for ever. It's not for diplomacy's sake that we often describe the Sudanese people as generous, innocent and hospitable. it's because we know them closer for a long time. if any one portrays the people of Sudan as bad, that person must by very bad himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why he often deprives the &quot;free press&quot; of their rights to attend his press conferences, Ato Meles said that to attend a premier or presidential press conference is an invitation and not a right. And that invitation is extended to qualified and accredited journalists and not to &quot;journalists&quot; who write fictitious reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the criterion to get that chance is one and only one: to stop lying,&quot; he underscored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But one thing the so-called free press don't seem to know about this government is that no foreign government, no matter how powerful it may be and no matter how it generously assists Ethiopia, can force us against our conviction. it may kill us by virtue of its military might but it can never force us to do things against our will. thus, it's high time that these people realize that appealing to Embassies now and then is a futile exercise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the progress of the case of his ex-deputy and Defence Minister Tamirat Layne, who was deposed from office on charges of corruption, Ato Meles said that the investigation has been finalized and that the case will be referred to the court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - Were internal revenue generation the only criter ion for having a state, Yobe state would, at best, qualify for a local government area. Of the N1.86 billion the six-year-old state intends to spend this year, it hopes to generate a paltry N50 million internally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is approximately the amount the Lagos State government wants to generate in two days to fund its N12.8 billion budget. While announcing the Yobe State budget in Damaturu, the state capital, John Ben-Kalio, the state administrator said the state would be relying on both the Federation Account and value added tax to the tune of N1.489 billion. Since the financial base of the state is so weak that it can barely breath on its own for weeks, the state will be doing what even the federal government shies away from: take external loans to the tune of N168 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pathetic as the Yobe State case is, the state is certainly not alone. Borno State which sired Yobe State in 1991 will equally need the federal might to survive. Of the N2.62 billion budget which Victor Ozodinobi announced January 24 before he was kicked out last week as state administrator, the state will only cough out N423 million. Ekiti, the four-month-old state also fits the bill as a parasitic state. Its N1.6 billion maiden budget will almost completely be financed outside, as the state says it will be able to cough out N 9 million internally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is less than what the state will get from VAT alone. Bauchi, Zamfara, Katsina, Taraba and Cross River states also have varying degrees of dependence on the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in sharp contrast to some states that, though would need money from the federally collected revenue, have succeeded in raising substantial funds from within. For instance, of the N4.5 billion Delta State has budgeted, it hopes to generate N1.9 billion internally. This is higher than the N1.53 billion it is getting from statutory earnings. VAT and capital receipts take care of the balance. Ogun State is in this club too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is generating internally N1.5 billion, the exact amount it will get from federal allocation. So also is Akwa Ibom State. Of the N2.83 billion budgetted, its share of the federation account is N1.79 billion. But by far, and by the internal reliance criterion, Lagos is the only state that does not need the federal might to function as a state. Of the N12.8 billion budgeted, Lagos will receive just N1.7 billion as statutory allocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, it is so far the only state that hopes to have a budget surplus.  While it is spending N12.8 billion, its total revenue for the year as announced by Mohammed Marwa, the state administrator, is put at N15.5 billion, a surplus of N2.7 billion.)((cf0</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another characteristic of the state budgets is the attempt to ba lance recurrent with capital expenditure. On this score, most states have a fairly balanced budget compared to what obtained in years past when a chunk of state finances went into recurrent spending. For instance, Oyo State is voting over N3 billion of th e N5.6 billion budget on capital expenditure. Yobe votes over a billion of its N1.9 billion on capital projects, just as Bayelsa is putting in N1.17 billion of its N1.8 billion budget on capital expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plateau State is spending N1.4 billion of its N2.2 billion budget on capital projects. Other states with a near-balance spending between recurrent and capital projections include Lagos, Borno, Enugu, Cross River, Sokoto, Bauchi, Zamfara, Edo, Katsina, Delta, Taraba and Niger states. But there are except ions. Akwa Ibom is one. It is voting a hefty N2.2 billion of its N2.8 billion budget on recurrent expenditure. This is made up of N1.27 billion on personnel, N487 million on overhead and N445 million on pension, gratuity, debt, etc. Despite its low level of development, the state is committing just N623 million for capital projects, a further confirmation that it is just a civil service state. Akwa Ibom has a friend in Adamawa state which is spending N1)((cf0 .35 billion of its N1.9 billion budget on recurrent expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In line with federal government directives, as enunciated by Anthony Ani, finance minister, virtually all the states are channelling their resources towards rural transformation. Sokoto, Bayelsa, Abia, Anambra, Enugu, Cross River and Niger states are voting substantially for the provision of basic amenities for rural dwellers. The same with Ogun, Oyo, Taraba, Edo, Delta, Akwa Ibom and Rivers states. These amenities are in the areas of health care, water provision, electrification, road constructi o n and rehabilitation and transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The states are equally complementing federal effort at job creation, poverty alleviation and rural resource expansion aimed at achieving the economic growth and development objectives of the 1997 federal budget. Th i s is to be achieved through agriculture. Almost all the states give premium to agriculture and food production. For instance, Niger State is putting down N100 million for agriculture and rural development; Ogun State is voting N232 million on agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state will be involved in mass production of improved seeds and seedlings. It is also carrying its rural development policy to greater length.  Sam Ewang, a wing commander and state administrator, has created Ogun State Water Corporation and Bureau for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rural Development to handle exclusively rural development matters. Sokoto, Plateau and Enugu States are also participating actively in agricultural development. Enugu State is reactivating oil palm and cashew plantations. The various state agricultural de velopment projects are to be adequately supported to assist in realising the increase in food production programme in the states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Amen Oyakhire, Taraba State administrator: &quot; Considering the fact that there is virtual absence of government in most part s of the state, the 1997 budget is focussed on aggressive rural transformation and the restoration of public confidence in government through the provision of physical infrastructures and essential social services ostensibly aimed at improving the living conditions of our people.&quot; Oyakhire speaks the minds of his counterparts in other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another indication that the states are working in consonance with the federal government's overall objective is shown in the fact that hardly any of them is embarking on any grandiose project. In fact, outside the opening up of the rural areas and provision of badly needed projects in the six new states, hardly any of the states is building new projects. In most cases, the billions of naira voted for capital projects go into the rehabilitation of projects, completion of viable, value-added on-going projects. Even at that, states must be sure that the funds to undertake these are available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prudence, discipline and accountability philosophy at the federal level is trickling down to the states. For instance, the states' financial projections were calculated on actual financial receipts between October 1995 and September 1996 to ensure that the money hoped for would be realisable.  This was meant to forestall the incidence of 1996 where most of the states' projections, especially in the area of internal revenue generation, fell short of actual collectable funds. For instance, while Imo State dreamt that it would generate N6 million in 1996, it actually squeezed N396 million internally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, each of the states has set up a project planning/monitoring committee in deference to the federal directive that all projects under execution must be monitored to ensure that implementation guidelines are adhered to. The states are also overhauling their internal revenue generation mechanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that all the states that have so far released their budgets belong to the billionaire club, will there be any genuine excuse if, by the end of the year, the economic well-being of the citizens has not substantially improved?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - By the time he was summoned to Aso Rock for the second time within weeks to answer charges of financial impropriety, Victor Ozodinobi knew that his days as the Borno State administrator were numbered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After days of uncertainty, the curtain was finally drawn on his brief tenure last Tuesday when he got &quot;the Mohammed Maina treatment.&quot; Maina, a colonel, was in 1991 removed from office as military governor of Borno by former president Ibrahim Babangida. He was promptly replaced by Mohammed Marwa, then a lieutenant colonel and deputy defence attache at the Nigerian Embassy in the United States. Maina was in office for only a couple of months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his part, Ozodinobi, a colonel who has been ordered back to the barracks, was in office for less than six months. He was appointed along with others on August 21 in a mass change of guards that affected all the then 30 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement signed by David Attah, chief press secretary to the head of state, merely informed that Sani Abacha, the head of state had approved the appointment of A. Aniebo, a lieutenant-colonel, as the new military administrator of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alhough Attah's statement gave no reason for the action, Theweek investigations showed that Ozodinobi was booted out because he played into the hands of his powerful adversaries in Borno. Popular with the masses for his anti-corruption stance, the Anambra-born colonel was said to have made enemies of several members of the indigenous elite whose sources of easy w ealth he plugged as soon as he assumed duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what was at first thought to be a smear campaign, Ozodinobi was soon accused of swindling the state by cornering choice and usually inflated contracts for himself and his allies. His waterloo came when his enemies, said to include influential traditional rulers, used some civil servants loyal to them, to obtain vouchers indicating that the erstwhile administrator might have awarded contracts worth over N150 million to himself and his acolytes. The vouchers were promptly forwarded to the presidency along with petitions alleging maladministration on the part of the former administrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worse for Ozodinobi, he had ruffled more than a few feathers while dissolving the state executive council in December. Apart from berating his commissioners for allegedly leaking government secrets at will, Ozodinobi miscalculated when he appointed six di rectors-general from the minority areas hitherto given crumbs during such appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first challenge before Aniebo, the new administrator, is to reconcile Borno citizens with the soldiers serving in the state. The relationship between both camps is frosty and has been further strained by the recent mob action involving students of the Government Day Secondary School located within the barracks of the 231 Tank Battalion, Biu, and some soldiers from the battalion. The disagreement over the outcome of a sporting event between students of GDSS and Government Secondary School, Waka, both in Borno State, had resulted in a fight that claimed the life of Nsuite Wande, a student of GDSS. The deceased was the son of a soldier from the 231 Tank Battalion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 30, some students of GDSS and others believed to be soldiers and colleagues of Wande's father stormed the town at night and went on a rampage to avenge the death of the boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among things destroyed during the riot were the official residence of the principal of Government Science Senior Secondary School which was torched.  The academic block of the school and two cars were also destroyed. The school was the venue of the botched games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ozodinobi, who was the commanding officer of the 231 Tank Battalion before his appointment as administrator, quickly set up a judicial panel to look into the circumstances surrounding the riot and recommend appropriate disciplinary actions for those found guilty of involvement in it. The former administrator was said to be under pressure from Abuja over the outcome of the panel's finding, as Aso Rock was desirous of meting out more serious punishment should the one recommended by the panel be considered inadequate or inappropriate. The panel's report, it was gathered, indicted soldiers from the 231 Tank Battalion as being behind the riot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aniebo will score an early plus if he is able to liaise with the authorities at the battalion to checkmate the unruly ones among the soldiers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - The day would have ended like any other day for the crew of the 15- seater Sky Power Express plane who had planned their itinerary to run through Plateau, Borno and Adamawa states. The aircraft with registration mark SN-AXS and callsign EAN143 was that day chartered by the Central Bank of Nigeria to carry its mail and certain important documents to some major cities in the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first leg of the journey had ended very well as the plane effortlessly discharged the cargo meant for Jos. The pilot therefore took off for Yola enroute Maiduguri.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as fate would have it, majority of the cities in the North-Eastern zone of the country were heavily enveloped by harmattan. The hazy clouds that day made visibility in the air very poor. It was this bad weathe r that the pilot ran into at Maiduguri and he found it difficult to land. The pilot then chose to re-order his itinerary by flying to Yola, which had been scheduled as the last port of call. By the new plan, the pilot intended to land the plane in Yola, offload the documents for the Adamawa State capital, and then head for Kano were he hoped to also deliver some cargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his plan was aborted at the Yola airport by a yet more hazy weather than the situation he had tried to avoid in Maiduguri. Landing in Yola then became difficult as the landing signals were blurred to the pilot. Efforts by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria officials to light up the runway and thereby enhance visibility did not yield any result. With the plane's fuel said to be fast dwindling, the pilot was said to have decided to risk landing despite the poor visibility. )((cf0</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was to end in a crash which claimed the lives of five of the people aboard including Samson Mshelia a group captain and experienced fighter pilot. The group captain was said to have tried to lend a helping hand when the plane was in distress in the air. The decision is believed to be his undoing, as the crash met him in the cockpit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven others were critically wounded and were admitted for treatment at the Springfield Hospital opposite the airport. Three of the survivors were treated and discharged for minor injuries and shock at the Yola Specialist Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plane crash created panic among residents of Jimeta area, who had never before experienc ed such a deafening din as that caused by the crash-landed plane. The Yola airport has been in existence since it served as a landing site for the British colonial regiment in the North. The crash also led to a total blackout in Yola and Jimeta following the serious damage done to NEPA high tension cables by the plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prominent citizens in Adamawa State including Kalu Igboamagh, the military administrator, and his wife, Grace, as well as Aliyu Musdafa, the Lamido Adamawa, have visited survivors of the crash in hospital, while prayers for the repose of the souls of the dead and the speedy recovery of those injured had been held in many religious centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But citizens belatedly await the official statement on the cause of the accident, which is an unfortunate addition to the long list of aviation disasters recorded in the country in the past twelve months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A team of aviation experts has arrived Yola to have an on-the-spot assessment of the crash. So far, the investigating team has recovered the plane's black box. Investigations are still on as the team has been busy taking pictures of the wreckage and inter viewing people in connection with the incident.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - For Abdussalam Sambo, until lately the executive secretary of the National Primary Education Commission, it is not yet time to what he describes as the the unwarranted character assassination&quot; to which Mohammed Liman, the ministe r of education, and Sani Idris, interim administrator of the commission, have subjected him. Not even his detention, at the Kabala Doki police station, Kaduna, has forced him to launch a counter-offensive.  Sambo believes that he will eventually be vindicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Sambo will not challenge Liman's actions, not so Usman Mahmood Abdullahi, director of finance and supplies, Alhassan Abdullahi Iman, deputy director of finance and supplies, and James Ayuba, director of internal audit.  The three men have collectively dragged Liman to the Federal Court, Kaduna, for wrongful suspension from duty. They are urging the court to restrain Liman from further interfering with their conditions of employment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last December 9 the federal high court presided over by Ok echukwu Okeke granted their prayers, pending the determination of the substantive suit.  That notwithstanding, Liman has gone ahead to dismiss the three top officials of the commission, who, in reaction, have filed a contempt suit against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indications are that Idris, the interim administrator of NPEC, sees the sacked officials, particularly Sambo, as being guilty as charged. While recently briefing chairmen of state primary schools education boards, he alleged that Sambo, in brazen disregard of governm e nt regulations on tenders, single-handedly awarded contracts valued at N537,950,040.25 for the printing of continuous assessment booklets and diaries for primary schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To bring home the enormity of Sambo's purported offence, Idris stressed that the dec ision to award the contracts was taken without the approval of the federal executive council, &quot;the only body that can award contracts of this magnitude.&quot; But Sambo's supporters vehemently deny this, claiming that Sambo had Liman's approval before awarding the contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources say that many of the contractors were sent from Abuja by people whose requests Sambo could not refuse. For instance, the contractor who installed the communication equipment at the commission's new headquarters building was said to have been sent by a serving general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another allegation against Sambo is that contrary to government requirement of its agencies, he failed to insure with the National Insurance Company of Nigeria the 587 vehicles he imported for distribution to the local government education authorities under the World Bank-assisted primary education programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former NPEC boss is accused of not only choosing a different insurance firm, but of unilaterally approving the payment of N81,121,243.41 as premium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other alleged sins of Sambo include spending the sum of N70, 8,404.56 to rehabilitate and relocate to the present site of the commission, N62,069, 370.43 in furnishing offices and residential quarters of senior staff of the commission, and N19,114,500 on printing of files for personnel audit without the approval of the relevant authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Idris, the contract for the printing of carbonised forms was the most scandalous. According to him, Sambo not only paid Nicouct Services Nigeria Ltd. the sum of N11,358 ,750 out of the total contract sum of N15,145,000, but also awarded the contract the same day the company submitted its tender.  Also being counted against Sambo is the fact that to publicize the &quot;good work&quot; he was doing, he spent N27,164,124.25 in 1996 alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summary of government's case against Sambo is that primary schools have remained what they were before his appointment, despite the release of about N32 billion to the commission between 1994 and September 1996. According to the findings of the audit panel that probed the commission, more than N1.1 billion was invested in commercial and merchant banks while until this year, government policy was that its agencies should bank with the central bank.  The panel observed that as a result of this practice, the commission was in the habit of releasing funds to state primary education boards late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may well be so. But, according to Sambo's supporters, the question which Liman must answer is, why did he fail to inaugurate the governing board of the commission, which would have served as a check on Sambo ? Why, indeed ?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - Ask any member of the five political parties in Rivers and Bayelsa states and he will tell you that his attention for now is focussed on next month's local government election. But in reality, many top politicians in both states are looking beyond the polls to see how their future ambitions could be realised. The party big-wigs are scheming to ensure that their candidates win the ultimate prize at the state level - the governorship ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Rivers State chapter of the Democratic Party of Nigeria, the State Election Committee headed by G.U. Ake is seen as an instrument set up by a group within the party to ensure that only their favoured candidates secure the party's nod to contest the local government election, with the ultimate aim to smoothen the gubernatorial path of a particular aspirant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ake, deputy chairman of Rivers DPN, is accused of setting rigid standards for chairmanship aspirants in the party. Among the conditions for clearance is that an aspirant's involvement in community development must be visible.  Falling short in this regard, many aspirants have back-pedalled, giving way to stronger politicians whose performances in community development were adjudged good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eager to sweep the polls, the DPN in the state has inaugurated a campaign committee with Uche Secondus as chairman. Secondus told Theweek that the committee's mandate is to mobilise its members and the electorate to vote massively for the DPN. The initiative is being supervised by Peter Odili, controversial national secretary of the party and a governorship aspirant who may end up as the greatest beneficiary of the intra-party schemings.</SPAN></P>

The party leadership is said to have adopted this strategy to curb attempts by some party stalwarts to manipulate the nomination process in favour of certain individuals. In Port Harcourt local government, the GDM has zoned the party chairmanship to Ogbuanabali.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - Will Nigeria really have an alternative government next month? This is a question which Nigerians at home and abroad may have to grapple with for some weeks. The question becomes necessary following the commencement by pro- democracy activists based in Europe and America, of moves to set up a legislative body to make laws for Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bolaji Akinyemi, a prominent member of the external wing of the National Democratic Coalition, had last week disclosed that the coalition in conjunction with the National Liberation Council of Nigeria and about 26 other pro-democracy groups in Nigeria, Europe and the United States would set up a 100-member parliament with full legislative powers on matters affecting the country. Akinyemi said that the assembly, the composition of which remains shadowy, was billed to be inaugurated next month. The former external affairs minister explained that the setting up of the legislative body is borne out of the need for practical steps to be taken to facilitate the end to military governance in Nigeria. &quot;Logic,&quot; he said in a British Broadcasting Corporation interview, &quot;stops at a particular point and practicality had to take over.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akinyemi claimed that an alternative voice of democracy that cannot be located within Nigeria has become inevitable. Without giving a concise working scope of the parliament, he maintained that the touchy issue of the governmental system and, by extension, the mode of constitution Nigeria should operate, would fall under the jurisdiction of the parliament. His words: &quot;Issues to be discussed under the assembly include whether Nigeria should remain a highly centralized or unitary state or remain (a) federal one.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of alternative government was first mooted in 1995. Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka, who left Nigeria in 1994 had in June the following year called on the pro-democracy and human rights activists abroad to set up a government in exile as an alternative to the Sani Abacha regime. As he explained later in an interview with the BBC, the government would be exercising authority on behalf of Moshood Abiola, the detained politician presumed to have won the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential election. Espousing a similar idea, Ralph Obioha, at the time NADECO's Canada and US representative, had declared in September at a forum in Washington that the coalition had accepted the challenge to form a government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that initial enthusiasm, the idea was left to gather dust on the drawing board. In the interim, the pro-democracy movement got a fillip with the setting up of a new body - NALICON - by Soyinka himself in 1995. Also, a radio station whose transmission point was suspected to be in Europe hit the airwaves on June 11 last year to mark the third anniversary of the ill-fated presidential election. Known originally as Radio Democratic International Nigeria, but later re-christened Radio Kudirat in honour of Abiola's assassinated senior wife, the station debuted with interviews with Soyinka and Anthony Enahoro who himself had earlier in the year fled abroad. Like Akinyemi, the veteran nationalist said that the government-in-exile's preoccupation would be to write a new constitution for Nigeria. He pointed out that apart from the 1959 constitution, all other constitutions had been imposed on the country by military regimes. To this end, Enahoro continued, the parliament would seek to restructure Nigeria along the path of a true federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actualisation of the alternative idea may well be an indication that the pro-democracy activists abroad are moving deeper and deeper into the path of confrontation. Akinyemi's BBC appearance came on the heels of an interview granted to The Washington Times by Abacha, in which the general condemned the activities of the pro-democracy groups, describing them as terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said the head of state: &quot;People like Wole Soyinka, they are terrorists.&quot; Abacha, like his lieutenants, indicted the pro-democracy activists for the various bomb blasts that rocked the country in the recent past, wondering why people who want democracy should be sabotaging a democratic process. He further alleged that the activists are being aided by foreign elements including non-governmental organisations. Amidst such labellings, analysts say, NADECO may have stepped up the quest for an alternative government to shake off the negative image being carved out for it by the Abacha regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tunde Babawale, a political science teacher at the University of Lagos, is one of those who think this way. According to him, the pro-democracy activists want to &quot;merely emphasise the fact that there is the need to phase out the crisis through dialogue.&quot; Babawale told Theweek that the reality of the inauguration of the parliament whenever it takes place is an &quot;indication of political instability within the country and therefore would serve as an irritant or pose problems for the military regime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ayo Olanrewaju, a Lagos-based legal practitioner, shares this view. He noted that the proposed parliament would put &quot;heat on the military junta&quot; just as the home-based pro-democracy activists at home are doing. Several attempts made by Theweek to reach NADECO members in Nigeria on the issue last week were not successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, a lot of questions surround the alternative government project.  How effective would the parliament be ? Who will inaugurate the body since Abiola is in detention ? For a body craving for democratic ideals, how democratic and legitimate is such a body? Akinyemi himself provided part of the answer. According to him: &quot;The fact that the new members of the parliament are not elected by universal suffrage does not detract from its legitimacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as Babawale is concerned, the issue of the legality of the parliament should not even arise as the 1979 constitution is there. He asked: &quot;Who says they can't put the 1979 constitution into use ? What is the constitution guiding the military government ?&quot; The University teacher noted that the Abacha regime itself, like other military governments, has been surviving on the basis of an arbitrary suspension of the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A clear battle of wits seems imminent. With Abacha's pregnant statement in The Washington Times interview that whether or not he contests the civilian election is for his military constituency to decide, next month may well be Nigeria's ides of March.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount includes various expenses on security, humanitarian assistance, housing and household equipment, as well as the purchase of agricultural equipment and inputs for the people, according to the plan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that the large part of the amount would come from bilateral and multilateral donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priority action would include Sanitation in the existing camps, national and international solidarity campaigns, setting up small income generating projects, training seminars on tolerance, cohabitation and peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document considers security as a necessary condition for the plan to succeed and calls especially on the ministry of national defence to &quot;organize and ensure security in camps for displaced people and around resettlement sites&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi has about 880,000 displaced people, 480,000 inside the country and 400,000 abroad, according to figures released by the ministry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - The South African Chamber for Agricultural Development in Africa (SACADA) has submitted a request to Mozambique to be involved in wildlife management in the Lugenda Valley in the northernmost provinces of Niassa and Cabo Delgado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area covers some 3,000 hectares. Sacada envisages the involvement of local communities in managing and exploiting the natural resources of the area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are interested in this project. The study the South Africans have presented guarantees the sustainable use of forestry and wildlife resources with the involvement of the local people,&quot; Aires Aly, the Niassa provincial governor, told the Mozambican News Agency, AIM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the national director of forestry and wildlife, Sergio Chitara, was more cautious. He said the Sacada project was &quot;not profound. It's only preliminary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that it would be necessary to provide more detail, and locate the project within the Mozambican government's overall strategy to ensure the correct use of natural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, said Chitara, it was only after the approval of statutes for the Mosagrius Development Corporation, that the Mozambican authorities would be in a position to take a decision on the proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mosagrius Corporation is the vehicle for cooperation between Mozambique and South Africa in the entire agricultural, livestock and forestry area.  Each of the governments will have 50 percent of the shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also hold the land on which all agricultural projects will take place. It will have an initial capital of one million U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Mosagrius programme, South African farmers will farm land in Niassa, particularly in the Lugenda Valley. Hence Sacada's interest in wildlife management in the same area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Mozambican official told AIM that the agreement formalizing the Mosagrius Corporation will be signed within a matter of days. He claimed that, after a year's delay, Sacada has finally reacted to the draft Mosagrius statutes presented by the Mozambican side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to analyze the South African reply before we can sign the document, &quot; the Mozambican said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sacada has blamed the Mozambicans, particularly the Investment Promotion Center, for the delays.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (PANA) - An African minister on Monday in Ouagadougou deplored the high rate of illiteracy in the continent where eight of every 10 inhabitants cannot read or write.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;African countries have the world's highest rates of illiteracy out of whom women and girls are still the major victims,&quot; Burkina Faso's minister of family affairs, and social action, Bana Wandaogo, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If one simply imagines that each illiterate person is 'an assassinated intellectual,' how many of such people will be tomorrow because of illiteracy, &quot; she told about 300 delegates attending a five-day sub-regional summit on female education which began Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to her, the right to education for all was the only remedy to the critical situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She challenged African governments to shake off their indifference to the silent suffering of innocent and vulnerable children, who need to be allowed access to happiness, play, health care, education and adequate food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wandaogo conceded, however, that implementation of the promises African leaders made at the 1990 world summit on children was being hampered by huge external debts, slow economic growth and inadequate investments in human resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also mentioned drought, environmental degradation, the spread of HIV/AIDS, political instability and armed conflicts as factors which have undermined the welfare of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her speech, former French First Lady Anne-Aymone Giscard d'Estaing also deplored the suffering brought on children through violence by adults, in spite of the fact that the 1989 convention on children's rights had been massively ratified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former First Lady, who heads a children's foundation called Fondation Pour l'Enfance, is the co-organizer of the Ouagadougou meeting, together with UNESCO, UNICEF and the Suka Foundation of Chantal Compaore, the spouse of Burkina president, Blaise Compaore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to her, among all the rights contained in the international convention on children's rights, the right to education is the most breached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that women constituted a third of all the world's 883 million illiterates aged above 15 years, and nearly 60 percent of the 129 million uneducated children aged between six and 11 years are girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her keynote opening address, Chantal Compaore urged participants to learn from the experience in children's rights from Africa and other parts of the world so as &quot;to set in motion the stifled hopes of children in our streets, awaken the assassinated intelligence of these illiterate girls and women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of the summit is &quot;Education For All With Priority to Girls and Women&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a follow-up to the April 1993 Pan-African conference on the education of girls. It is the first in a series devoted to the implementation of the international convention on the rights of children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Ecowas (Economic Community of West African States) Ministerial Committee of Nine on Liberia has decided to set up an independent electoral commission for the May 30 elections in the war-torn West African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, to replace the present ad-hoc body, will comprise seven members, three nominated by the faction leaders and four from the civilian population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four would represent labor and trade unions, the coalition of political parties, women and youth organizations. These were part of the decisions reached at the ministerial meeting which ended Friday in Monrovia, the Liberian capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria is the chairman of Ecowas, the 16-member Economic Community of West African States. Its foreign minister, Tom Ikimi, chaired the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a communique released Saturday, the ministers said they would stick by the scheduled elections date, based on the Abuja Peace Accord on Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls are for the parliament, the president and the vice-president for Liberia, which has been embroiled in a six-year-old civil war that has killed at least 150,000 people and made half the country's estimated 2.8 million population refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Ecowas-supervised disarmament is in progress ahead of rehabilitation of combatants and the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministers said the committee agreed that although the time for the election was short, a lot of work was required, contingent on more financial and logistic support to carry through peace programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee also decided to retain a bi-cameral system of parliament for Liberia made up of 64 members of the House of Assembly and 26 senators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members are to be elected on the basis of proportional representation designed to ensure that the outcome reflected an all-inclusive parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of Liberian refugees scattered across West Africa, the council decided that voting must be inside Liberia, while efforts should be made to facilitate the return of refugees outside the country to participate in the registration and electoral processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee is looking to the United Nations to help return the refugees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria has lost over the years some 285,000 square kilometers (110,038 square miles) of its land area to soil erosion, according to the latest data released by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture at the week-end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loss represents slightly less than one third of the country's total land area of 924,000 square kilometers (356,756 square miles)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry's figures showed that gully erosion washed away some 115,000 square kilometers (44,401 square miles) of the land area. Badly hit are the eastern states of Imo, Enugu, Akwa Ibom, Abia, Anambra and the midwestern state of Delta.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wind erosion, ravaging the northern parts of the country, accounted for 65, 000 square kilometers (25,096 square miles) in the loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 71,000 square kilometers ( 27,413 square miles) were lost to sheet erosion, while other forms of erosion accounted for a loss of 34,000 square kilometers (13,127 square miles).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statistics also showed that Nigeria lost annually, an average of 200, 000 hectares ( 409,420 acres) in its forest and woodlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, the ministry said, resulted in a decline from an estimated 14.6 million hectares ( 29.9 million acres) of forest and woodlands in 1981, to 1.  08 million hectares (2.42 acres) in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Anambra State alone, experts estimate that some 305 million naira (3.8 million U.S. dollars) would be needed to control devastating erosion in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state military administrator, Group Capt. Rufai Garba, recently lamented the huge loss of farmlands, houses and other property to erosion scourge in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities in other parts of eastern Nigeria have also raised alarm over the disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the depletion of forest reserves in northern Nigeria is blamed for the high rate of desert encroachment in that Sahelian belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts counsel preventive measures such as intensification of tree planting programme and sustainable consumption as the only way out.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - Over the past several weeks, the Buyoya government has compounded long standing efforts to convince the international community that it has been able to restore peace and the rule of law throughout most of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true that security has improved somewhat in many parts of the country.  The UN now conducts regular assessment missions in northern Bubanza and Cibitoke, areas of the country that, until several months ago, the UN had made off-limits to its staff. However, it is also true that massacres by both sides of the conflict continue. As part of its campaign to convince both Burundians and the wold at large that it has been able to restore order in Burundi, the government has issued separate statements aggressively criticizing both a recent human rights report claiming that 1,100 people had been killed in December and January in Burundi as well as more general comments on the situation in the country made by the European Community's special envoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next meeting of Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee (RSCC), originally scheduled for February 9-10, is now scheduled to be February 12.  Although no new broad exemptions to the sanctions are expected until it is clear that negotiations between the warring factions in Burundi are moving forward, the RSCC is expected to clarify the procedures for the importation of fuel and other exempted supplies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. GENERAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what is the latest crackdown against high-ranking members of the Hutu dominated FRODEBU party, the organization's Secretary General Augustin Nzojibwami was taken into custody February 11. He had been under house arrest for the previous week. Prosecutors have accused Nzojibwami of subversive activities and inciting civil unrest, although the exact charges against him are still unclear. According to local journalists, he has also angered the government by publicly criticizing its policy of regrouping into special camps inhabitants of areas the government has deemed insecure. In November, prosecutors accused National Assembly Speaker Leonce Ngendakumana of having participated in massacres in Bujumbura Rural province in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US State Department says that it has &quot;ample evidence&quot; that foreign troops have crossed into Zaire, but would not comment on which countries or groups were providing support, or to which side of the conflict support was being provided. The US has said that it wants to ensure the territorial integrity of Zaire but does not want to see the involvement of foreign troops fighting on either side of the conflict. In a February 6 statement, the French Foreign Ministry said it shared the US position on foreign intervention in the region. The Zairian government has repeatedly accused Burundi, as well as Uganda and Rwanda, of backing rebels in eastern Zaire.  Burundian Foreign Minister Luc Rukingama, in Brussels to promote his government's policies, said that &quot;Burundi has never sent troops into any neighbouring countries. &quot;We have no interest to infiltrate troops into neighbouring countries,&quot; the minister told a press conference. He added that Burundian troops were too busy at home dealing with &quot;armed Hutu groups and killers&quot; to be involved in Zaire. In a statement last week, Zairian army headquarters in Kinshasa said that Burundian troops were fighting along side rebels in the eastern part of the country. Later, however, an army spokesman said that Zaire had no concrete proof of Burundi's involvement in its domestic crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burundian government has accused members of the international community of intentionally spreading disinformation about the conflict in the country.  In a February 4 statement, government spokesman Pierre Claver Ndayicariye said that for the last several months, Burundi has been witness to &quot;a disinforamtion campaign orchestrated by certain members of the international community who say they have come to promote peace in our country.&quot; The statement added that certain members of the community continued to maintain that the situation in Burundi was continuing to deteriorate while in reality security had improved throughout the country. The statement singled out European Union envoy Aldo Ajello for particular criticism. Following President Buyoya's meeting in Arusha with Ajello and other international mediators, Ajello told reporters that the behaviour of the authorities in Burundi had not encouraged the international community to remove the sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maohamed Sahnoun, the special envoy to the Great Lakes for both the UN and the OAU, is expected to arrive in Burundi February 14. Sahnoun, who will also travel to Kinshasa and Kigali, is charged with restoring peace to the Great Lakes, with special reference to the conflicts in Burundi and Zaire. One of his initial tasks will be to prepare an international conference on the Great Lakes which has the backing of the Security Council. He is due to present his first report by the beginning of March. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, who has been travelling in the Great Lakes since February 6, arrived in Burundi February 10 for two days of meetings with representatives of the Burundian government and international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vatican announced February 9 that Simon Ntamwana, the Bishop of Bujumbura, would be the new Archbishop of Burundi. Burundi has been without an Archbishop since September, 1996 when Archbishop Joachin Ruhuna was assassinated in a road ambush near Giteaga. Sources say that Ntamwana has quietly worked for the past three years to facilitate contacts between both sides of the conflict. Over the past two years, several members of his family have been killed by Tutsi extremists. He also narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in March, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Bank representatives recently visited Burundi to evaluate the status of Bank programs in Burundi. The Bank suspended credit to Burundi in October but continues to finance rehabilitation programs in the health and sanitation sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. SECURITY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few security incidents have been reported in recent weeks, although this may partly be due to the government's attempt to ensure more positive coverage of the situation in the country. Over the reporting period, soldiers clashed with rebels in Gitabla commune, Rutana province. While rebels were based in eastern Zaire, Rutana, and other provinces on the boarder with Tanzania reported fewer security incidents than those provinces in western Burundi. It is unclear if that trend will continue with many of the Hutu rebels who had been in camps in Zaire now in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. AFFECTED POPULATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs and UN agencies involved in the agricultural sector, or those providing support to returnees or displaced populations, have begun coordinated distributions of seeds and agricultural tools to vulnerable groups throughout the country. The distributions, coordinated by FAO, will provide support to 136,000 families in all ll 17 provinces. Hoes, bean seeds and vegetable seeds will be distributed. Of those receiving aid, 40,000 of the recipients are displaced, 34,000 are regrouped, 15,000 are returnees, 5, 000 are dispersed while the remaining are members of other vulnerable groups.  In addition to FAO, those organizations providing assistance in the agricultural sector include: UNHCR, WFP, IFRC, ActionAid, ACF, Care International, CRS, Christian Aid, Dorcas Aid, GTZ, INTERSOS, Oxfam Quebec and World Vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A committee, chaired by FAO, will manage all the participants stocks as a whole. Those organizations which have goods immediately available for distribution will have their goods distributed first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF is working with displaced populations in Rukaramu in rural Bujumbura to examine the feasibility of using baked clay pots in place of jerry cans.  With sanctions limiting the supply of imported jerry cans, substitutes for storing liquids may be increasingly necessary. UNICEF also announced that on February 7 it received 430,000 doses of tetanus vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Rehabilitation announced last week that it has prepared a plan of action for integrating displaced populations into their home communities. Provincial governors and others involved in implementing the plan have been briefed, however, details of the plan were not available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources indicate that there are now over 100,000 displaced in Kayanza province spread among seven camps. Nyarurama, with 20,000 inhabitants is the largest and is in central Kayanza. Many of those displaced in the province were forced to flee their homes after heavy fighting in the province in early December. CRS has said it will consider providing food and non-food relief items to the displaced once they return to their communes of origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. COORDINATION OF HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts are underway to improve the quality and quantity of data on existing displaced sites and of other vulnerable groups. FAO, UNICEF, WFP and DHA have agreed on a new data collection questionnaire which is now being tested at various sites. The form is being used to collect information including the location and date of establishment of site, the category, number and ethnic origin of affected people and the type and scope of assistance provided. The information will be updated as regularly as possible to ensure that trends and conditions of affected populations are monitored closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. EFFECT OF SANCTIONS ON OPERATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Transportation has announced that, effective February 1, humanitarian organizations would no longer have to pay royalties on humanitarian goods imported into Burundi. Air Burundi, the national airline, had demanded that MSF-Belgium pay the company $7,000 in &quot;royalty fees&quot; or be denied the right to bring medical supplies by air into Burundi. The four MSF chapters support health centers and hospitals in eight of the country's fifteen provinces. MSF issued a press statement protesting against the demand for royalties, and warned it would reconsider its support for the country's health care system if it does not receive an exoneration from the fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An FAO study shows a wide variation in changes of prices of agricultural goods and other consumer items since July 1996. The study indicates that prices of most goods have increased, and the prices of some have more than doubled. Peas for example, have increased in price by 200% and salt 100%.  Comparing their price at the pump in July and their current price on the parallel market, the price of diesel has increased by 233% while the price of petrol has gone up by 263%</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Rebel-held Bukavu in eastern Zaire was reported bombed by at least two planes at around 4pm local time today. Several bombs were dropped, some near the city centre and market place, causing an unknown number of casualties. Deaths have been reported but not confirmed. Aid workers are assisting the wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for a halt to the militarisation of Tingi-Tingi camp in eastern Zaire, saying it &quot;puts at risk the lives of innocent refugees and humanitarian workers&quot;. The Secretary- General made the statement after meeting on Friday with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.) The statement said young male refugees were being actively recruited. Kofi Annan called on leaders in the region to &quot;prevail on the protagonists to the conflict to accept a ceasefire and allow time for negotiations to resume.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, expressed concern about the situation in the camp after her visit last week. On Friday, in Kigoma, Tanzania, the High Commissioner said &quot;I appeal to Kabila not to attack Tingi- Tingi&quot;. Mrs Ogata said in a later press conference in Dar es Salaam, that the same airstrip being used for relief supplies was being used for military supplies. News agencies report a senior UNHCR official as saying he had observed refugees unload military hardware. Rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila has issued various contradictory statements regarding Tingi-Tingi over the last week, but today reportedly repeated a previous promise to keep his troops away. CNN has shown pictures from Tingi-Tingi of armed Rwandans, and flights arriving carrying military supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes Region, Martin Griffiths, met with senior representatives of the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire yesterday in rebel-held eastern Zaire. The Humanitarian Coordinator discussed possible repatriation of Rwandan refugees and the extension of the humanitarian programme in rebel-held territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Secretary-General of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) said on Sunday that the OAU was becoming &quot;more and more concerned&quot; over the situation in eastern Zaire. Salim Ahmed Salim was speaking from Brazzaville, Congo, where he had held talks with Congolese President Pacal Lissouba on the Zairean crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The European Union also expressed concern about Tingi-Tingi camp in a statement issued on Friday. The Dutch EU presidency said in the statement that the EU had learnt with great concern from UNHCR that &quot;weapons, ammunition and uniforms have been delivered to the Tingi-Tingi refugee camp&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The militarisation of Tingi-Tingi camps - now holding about 150,000 Rwandans - again raises the issue of seperating armed extremists from legitimate refugees. UN agencies and NGOs have been unable to come up with any decisive proposal on how to segregate the two. Regional leaders and aid organisations warned early on in the eastern Zaire conflict that failure to get to the &quot;root cause&quot; - including the issue of separation - would only exacerbate the crisis. This month there have been renewed calls for an intervention force, or police force, to provide protection for refugees.  Although there have been no reports of fighting in Tingi-Tingi, there is a persistently high death rate amongst refugees because of the disrupted and limited relief efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Four African foreign ministers are due to go to Zaire tomorrow to help mediate in the Great Lakes crisis, reports AFP from South Africa. According to a South African Foreign Ministry spokesman, Pieter Swanepoel, ministers from Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe will spend three days on the mission. The Zaire mission is expected to pave the way for a further regional summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Zairean Minister of Information and Press issued a decree banning private radio and television stations from &quot;producing, broadcasting or relaying political programmes&quot;, reports state-run Zairean radio (15 February).  They are also banned from broadcasting radio and television newscasts and press reviews. The government complained of &quot;enemy propaganda&quot; in announcing the ban. Private papers have openly accused President Mobutu and the government of neglecting the war effort and misappropriating funds, and more recently have carried satirical cartons regarding his prostate cancer.  President Mobutu, presently in his home town Gbadolite, appears to be unmoved by mounting domestic pressure to negotiate with the rebels or resign. Public rallies and demonstrations have also been banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Gabonese radio reported on Sunday (February 16) that Zairean parliamentarian Joseph Oligankoye escaped by river to Brazzaville to escape a government hunt for those who initiated last Monday's partially sucessful &quot; dead day&quot; strike. Two other parliamentarians, Aziz Kundili and Sanga Bongaga, have also reportedly gone underground because of the government crackdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* On Saturday, Mohamed Sahnoun, the Joint OAU/UN Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region, met Mobutu in Gbadolite. UN officials in New York said Sahnoun would convey the UN Secretary-General's concern about the militarisation of Tingi-Tingi to the Kinshasa government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Rwanda, head of the state council court and vice president of the Rwandan supreme court, Vincent Nzazabaganwa, was assassinated on Friday (February 14) night. His wife said he was gunned down in his Kigali home by men in military uniform. Exile opposition group Resistance Forces for Democracy (FRD) said in a press release from Brussels, Febraury 15th, that it had recieved reports of a number of recent assasinations, including Alphonse Marie Nkubito on February 12 (Jurist and magistrate, and head of Rwandan human rights organisation Association Rwandaise de Defense des Droits de l'Homme), Jean Pierre Niyonzima on February 12 (Mayor of Ndusu commune, Ruhengeri), Paul Mbugurije on January 21 (former chief judge at the Local Communal Magistrates Court of Rutongo), Denis Kanyamibwa (civil servant in the Ministry of Finance) and lists eight other un-named people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan human rights organisation ADL (13 February) denounces the killings of 36 people since January 21, and says the increase of murders, illegal arrests and disappearances comes at the same time as the publication of the list of &quot;first category people suspected to be involved in the genocide&quot;. UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda have reported that between December 1996 and January 1997, 227 genocide survivors had been killed in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State-run Radio Rwanda yesterday reported that security forces had shot dead last Thursday the man responsible for the assassination of five UN human rights monitors (February 4). Radio Rwanda said security forces also shot dead one of his accomplices, and another had been detained. Various weapons were recovered, including anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, walkie-talkies and several military uniforms. Security forces also reportedly found a passport of one of the human rights monitors, and personal photographs. Radio Rwanda also reported that security forces killed six out of seven suspects on Friday in Runda commune, Gitarama; arrests continue there, following reports last week of a further four killings of genocide survivors. Genocide survivors have asked the Rwandan government to be re-settled in groups for security reasons; on January 28 the government announced it would undertake a new re-settlement policy to incorporate &quot;group settlements&quot; of houses, farmland and public facilities for 100 to 200 survivor families per settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Former vice-president of the extremist MDR-Power Party, Froduald Karamira, was found guilty on Friday of being a ringleader in the 1994 genocide, and sentanced to death by a Rwandan court. According to Radio Rwanda, the main charges included having supported the Interahamwe militia by arming and training them, having killed or intended to kill named persons, and having incited people to exterminate their neighbours. The court also ordered Karamira to pay 1.1 billion Rwandan francs, and granted him 15 days leave to appeal against the sentence. Karamira, the most senior suspect found guilty in Rwanda, was born a Tutsi but converted by custom to Hutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Friday in a press conference he would discipline UN officials if necessary in response to the highly critical internal report on mismanagement in the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Four top Rwandan massacre suspects transfered from Cameroon to Arusha last month will appear for an initial hearing on Wednesday and Thursday at the Arusha Tribunal. On Thursday, charges will be read to Colonel Theoneste Bagosora. A former senior official at the Ministry of Defence, Bagosora is alleged to have taken control of military and political affairs in Rwanda following the plane crash in which President Habyarimana was killed, 1994.  His lawyers last week requested the tribunal to provide them with findings of the investigations into the plane crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* No statement has been issued to date by the Regional Sanctions Committee, who are reported to have met in Lusaka, Zambia, for two days February 13-14.  Joint OAU/UN Special Representative Mohamed Sahnoun held talks with Burundi leader Pierre Buyoya on Friday and said there was need for a comprehensive aid plan for the region. Ambassador Sahnoun told reporters in Bujumbura he did not immediately envisage an international peacekeeping force being sent to Zaire, but that things could change following talks with other leaders in the region. Ambassador Sahnoun is scheduled to arrive in Kigali, Rwanda, tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Four soldiers in the Burundian army, including a lieutenant, have been given prison sentences of eight to ten years for massacring about forty innocent civilians. The sentences were handed down on Saturday by a military court in a southern town, Bururi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Burundian authorities complained that UN human rights monitors &quot;sent reports only to foreign countries&quot;, reported state-run radio Burundi, February 14th. According to the report, the authorities said the human rights reports were made &quot;without regard for agreements signed with Burundi and that those who wrote the reports seemed to support the killers and failed to acknowledge that peace was slowly returning&quot;. Buyoya recently challenged the international community to send more UN human rights monitors. According to a January 29 report published by the UN Human Rights office in Burundi, Hutu rebels and the Burundi military have killed at least 1,100 people over the two months prior to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Kenya's Mombasa port reported a considerable cargo boost last year, due mainly to food supplies to the Great Lakes region, reports the regional East African weekly newspaper. The volume of Rwandan cargo through the port of Mombasa last year increased by almost 50% over 1995's total. According to the report, Burundi has close to 120,000 tonnes of imports marooned at the port - and much more at the port of Dar es Salaam - because of the effects of regional sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The state-owed Tanzanian newspaper &quot;Sunday News&quot; reported from Kigoma, Tanzania, that 50 Zairean soldiers arrived at the port on Friday; and that 161 heavily armed soldiers surrendered to Tanzanian police on Wednesday. 105 NATO and Chinese-made guns, 19 bombs, a grenade and thousands of rounds of ammunition were reportedly confiscated from the soldiers. Acting Regional Commissioner for Kigoma, Alhaji Ahmed Lugusha, described the new arrivals as crestfallen: &quot;Most of them had talismans tied on their arms and waists, rolls of bhang (cannabis) and some strange potions, strongly suggesting that they believed in witchcraft in their counter-offensive against the rebels&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The office of Kenyan president, Daniel arap Moi, denied this week that it has issued any letters clearing controversial Kenyan billionaire Ketan Somaia of defaulting on a R35-million tender contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supposed letter was used by Mpumalanga Parks Board (MPB) head, Alan Gray, to dismiss concerns regarding Somaia's business dealings in Kenya after he signed a secret 50-year deal with the MPB for exclusive commercial development rights to six state owned game reserves, the Blyde River Canyon, Loskop Dam and Pilgrim's Rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal, between Somaia's Dubai-based Dolphin Group and the MPB, has outraged rural communities, conservationists and land claim activists, who all point out that there are gazetted land claims on core areas of the project and that affected communities have still not been consulted.  The deal was signed secretly on November 1 by Gray but was only publicly announced four weeks later.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repeated requests for copies of the alleged letter to Gray, as well as comment from the MPB on the Kenyan denial were unsuccessful this week.  Kenya's High Commissioner to South Africa, Justice Mudavadi, called Gray's insistence &quot;very strange and surprising&quot; on Wednesday, saying that President Moi would never address another country's officials directly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Protocol demands that my president would only write a letter to his counterpart, President Mandela, and not someone who is a relatively junior official - especially with-out informing my office. I know of no such letter and find this whole thing very strange and surprising,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ketan Somaia himself also refuted the existence of the letter this week, saying that Moi would have no motivation for writing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia however re-iterated that he was innocent of any wrongdoing in Kenya, where he has declined at least three formal requests to testify about the non- delivery of police equipment worth more than R35-million before Kenya's Public Accounts Committee (PAC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did, however, concede for the first time that he was linked to the two London based companies which had defaulted on the 1989 contract and that he still served as their commissioned agent in Kenya.  &quot;But I am not a director or shareholder in either company. I decided not to testify because the formalities of finally delivering on the contract had begun and I therefore felt that there was no need for me to appear before the PAC,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incensed by his refusal to appear and the two companies failure to deliver after receiving payment, the PAC tabled a recommendation before the Kenyan Parliament last month calling for the government to pass a resolution banning it from ever entering into any contracts or other agreements with Somaia or any companies associated with him again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAC chairman, Michael Wamalwa, however, sent a brief letter to Somaia's South African attorney's on December 3 stating that the Kenyan billionaire no longer needed to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second letter, dated January 17, added that Somaia had actually assisted the govern-ment recover 80 percent of the outstanding order by interceding in the matter for the government. The letter also contended that Somaia had submitted evidence proving that he was not connected to the two companies which had defaulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both letters were used by Somaia's SA attorneys, Cliff Decker and Todd, to attempt to prevent the publication of articles by M&amp;G on either Dolphin or Somaia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When M&amp;G attempted to confirm the validity of the letters in Kenya late last week, the PAC reacted with outrage, insisting that Somaia had in no way been cleared of involvement in the debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Committee member Martin Chikuku added that Wamalwa had instead been forced to publicly apologise for issuing the letters and Wamalwa is also, Chikuku said, currently being quizzed on a mysterious 10-million Kenyan Shilling donation to his party's election campaign coffers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were shocked to hear that a letter absolving Somaia had been issued, because there is no way that he has been cleared,&quot; he told M&amp;G.  &quot;The PAC firmly believes that Somaia directly benefited from this episode because if a man has no interest or ownership in a company, then how can he force them to suddenly - after seven years - begin honour-ing their contracts?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wamalwa's election campaign coalition partners, the Democracy Party, also publicly cut ties with him last week after the apology, but retained their links with his party, FORD Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moolman Mentz, a leading member of a Mpumalanga Legislature team which recently returned from an all-expense paid tour of Dolphin's various subsidiary's hotels and lodges in Kenya and Dubai said that he had informally quizzed Somaia on the allegations and had been completely satisfied with the explanations.  He added that he had also been shown official government letters clearing Somaia but declined to specify whether the letters had been from Moi or Wamalwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa is not for sissies. In any case, if you look at the amounts involved, then the alleged misappropriation is like a drop of water in the sea compared to the Kenyan economy - or even the Dolphin economy,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also, all businessmen have at least some deals that go sour and some that work out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mentz repeatedly stressed that the current negative press about Somaia and Dolphin were not in the province's interests that should Dolphin withdraw, the press would be responsible for costing the province at least R55-billion in investment over 50-years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a fallacy to think that the Mpumalanga government will ever subject investors to tender processes or in depth investigations. If we create the perception that investors will be investigated in this manner, it is doubtful that whether (we) will attract any investors at all,&quot; he added.  Conceding that mistakes had been made by the MPB and that communities should have been consulted, Somaia said for the first time on Wednesday that following the public outcry, he was prepared to renegotiate the controversial 39-page contract &quot;in the interests of affected communities, the deal itself and South Africa at large&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Representatives from the Zairean government and the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) have reportedly arrived in South Africa, but the South African government says no details will be released at this stage. In Johannesburg, President Nelson Mandela's official spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, would only say that South Africa's role was to &quot;consult with various parties involved in the conflict&quot;.  Reuters reports South African Director General of Foreign Affairs, Rusty Evans, as saying that there was great reluctance from both parties to acknowledge a willingness to negotiate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* There are at least four initiatives to resolve the Zairean and Great Lakes crises which came to the fore today. They are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; anticipated face-to-face talks today between representatives of the Zairean government and the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) in South Africa, hosted but not brokered by President Nelson Mandela. US embassy officials confirmed that Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, George Moose, and US National Security Council Senior Director for Africa, Susan Rice, were in Cape Town to &quot;bolster the process&quot;, reports Reuters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; a returning mission today of African Foreign Ministers from Kinshasa, who have been mandated by a regional summit (Nairobi II) and a ministerial meeting in Pretoria, South Africa, to follow up on the Great Lakes crisis.  The delegation consisted of Foreign Ministers from Tanzania, Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa, the Secretary-General of the Organisation of African Unity, Salim Ahmed Salim, and representation from Cameroon and Congo. In a joint statement issued today, the delegation said they had discussed the possibility of a &quot;Nairobi III&quot; summit, and had up-dated the Zairean authorities on issues raised in regional summits on territorial integrity, inviolability of national borders, immediate cessation of hostilities, and withdrawal of foreign troops. The statement said the UN-sponsored peace plan could be discussed within the context of an &quot;enlarged regional summit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; the five-point peace plan, endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 1097 (February 18) which is being pursued by Joint OAU/UN Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region, Mohamed Sahnoun, who was in Kigali, Rwanda, today. He is scheduled to pass briefly through Nairobi tonight before flying on to Geneva. The plan calls for: immediate cessation of hostilities; withdrawal of all external forces, including mercenaries; reaffirmation of respect for the national sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Zaire and other States of the Great Lakes region; protection and security of all refugees and displaced persons and facilitation of access to humanitarian assistance; and, rapid and peaceful settlement of the crisis through dialogue, the electoral process and the convening of an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region.  There has been a mixed regional response to the UN peace plan, which has strong international backing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who is in Cape Town, South Africa, has called on parties to the conflict to declare a cease-fire and make preparations for elections in Zaire. Museveni says it was his idea that representatives from the Zairean government and rebels should meet, reports AFP. President Museveni was in Cape Town after holding talks with Presidents Mandela of South Africa, Chissano of Mozambique, Masire of Botswana and Mugabe of Zimbabwe (February 19) on regional issues, including the Zaire crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan praised the efforts by South African President Nelson Mandela to arrange face-to-face talks between Zairean government representatives and the rebel ADFL. He expressed hope that the meeting &quot;would actually take place&quot;. AP reports Western diplomats saying that the South African government had been seeking a role in the crisis for some time; it is the first time Mandela has accepted the mantle of African statesman in a conflict outside South African borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo told Reuters on Wednesday that he was &quot;unaware&quot; of any emissary sent by President Mobutu to meet the rebel leader. Kengo wa Dondo has been resolutely opposed to negotiations with the rebels. Diplomatic sources anticipate Honore Ngbanda - a close security advisor to President Mobutu - will attend the talks. South African newspapers have reported that Ngbanda is in Cape Town in preparation for talks. The representative of the ADFL reportedly left by private plane from Kigali for Cape Town on Wednesday night, but it is now thought unlikely that Laurent- Desire Kabila will himself represent the ADFL in the talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Chairman of the Regional Sanctions Co-ordinating Committee (RSCC) confirmed in writing yesterday that the RSCC meeting in Lusaka on 14 February 1997 approved requests for &quot;defined&quot; fuel importation to Burundi for the use of UN agencies and NGOs. The Committee approved diesel, petrol and Jet A-1 fuel supplies amounting to 485,950 litres per month. The Committee said importation would have to be done &quot;strictly through Dar es Salaam, Tanzania&quot;.  No other expansion of exemptions has been granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Thirteen people were killed when gunmen attacked a town in southwestern Burundi on Monday night, state-run Burundi radio reported on Tuesday. Most of those killed were women and children. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said about 50 gunmen entered Mugara town late on Monday when most of the male residents were out on a security patrol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* On Tuesday, United Sates State Department spokesman Glyn Davis condemned Zairean government air raids on rebel-held centres. In a news briefing, Davis condemned air raids and other acts of violence saying it would only serve to perpetuate the conflict, reports Reuters. The death toll from air-raids in Bukavu has risen to 19; Reuters says more bodies have been pulled from the rubble since the original death toll of nine on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Rwanda, three people were shot dead in Kibuye prefecture, commune Mabanza, on February 17, after a group of 30 armed men stopped two public service vehicles. According to sources in Rwanda, people from the vehicles were separated, Tutsi from Hutu. Three Tutsis were killed. The vehicles were burnt and money stolen from travelling traders; a driver was wounded.  Unconfirmed reports from the prefecture said the group of uniformed armed men said they were fighting for &quot;a takeover&quot; and announced the names of two people they were targetting in the military and the local administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Rwandan government has responded to an Amnesty International (AI) report (February 19) saying its allegations are &quot;unfounded&quot; and questioning its research methods. The AI statement placed most of the blame for recent killings on human rights violations by the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA). IPS quotes political advisor to the Rwandan government, Claude Dusaidi saying AI was &quot;on record as defending genocide criminals&quot; - a reference to the recent report released by London-based African Rights critisising AI for calling a man charged with rape, murder and mutilation, a &quot;prisoner of conscience&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Lieutenant-Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva, former commander of military operations in Rwanda's Gisenyi prefecture, and Ferdinand Nahimana, former director of Radio Television des Milles Collines, pleaded not guilty to all charges against them in the Arusha International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda yesterday. Nsengiyumva is said to have presided over a meeting in Gisenyi prefecture, during which he ordered the killing of civilians. Nahimana is, among other counts, charged with having control over broadcasts designed to &quot; achieve inter-ethnic hatred and encourage the population to kill and commit other acts of violence&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - &quot;The exceptional situation in the country requires the adoption of specially adapted measures to satisfy the need for justice of the people of Rwanda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These words, encapsulated in Rwanda's newly promulgated Organic Law (or Genocide Law), illustrate the necessity to show Rwandans in particular, and the world in general, that the architects of the April-July 1994 genocide cannot go unpunished. Two and half years after the mass slaughter in which at least 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus died, the beginning of 1997 finally witnessed the start of trials of those suspected to have taken part in the Rwandan genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parallel trials are underway, both in Rwanda and in Arusha, Tanzania, where the UN International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) is based. The scope and mandate of the two systems vary enormously. The ICTR, with a budget of $36 million for 1996, has indicted 21 people. Thirteen are in detention (11 in Arusha, one in Switzerland and one in the USA), the others are still at large. Rwanda's jails and detention centres, meanwhile, are crammed with some 90,000 detainees, of whom about 2,000 are on a preliminary official list of &quot; Category 1&quot; accused as provided for in the Organic Law (Footnote 1). If found guilty, these defendants face the death penalty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda's Directeur de Cabinet in the Ministry of Justice, Gerald Gahima, points out that his country's justice system had to be started from scratch after the war. According to some estimates, the sheer number of detainees in Rwanda means it would theoretically take about 200 years to judge them all.  Rwanda has indicated that prisoners on the Category 1 list will go to trial.  It is hoped many others will come forward under a &quot;Confession and Guilty Plea&quot; procedure contained in the Organic Law, according to which self-confession could result in reduced penalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But although Category 1 defendants have the right to confess and plead guilty, the death penalty to which they are liable is mandatory and must be pronounced by the court. The UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) says the &quot;Confession and Guilty Plea&quot; measure marks a radical innovation in criminal procedure as hitherto followed in Rwanda. A defendant who wishes to plead guilty must describe in detail all the offences committed, the date, time and scene of each criminal act and the names of victims and witnesses if known. S/he must also furnish any further information which may aid the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time will tell whether this procedure is effective and workable. Rwandan officials have gone to South Africa to look into the workings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission there and it is likely that once the trials have been underway for a length of time, a similar mechanism will be set up in Kigali. The South African Truth Commission is empowered to grant reparations to victims of atrocities as well as an amnesty or indemnity from prosecution for perpetrators who confess their crimes. In the meantime, Rwanda appears to be steaming ahead with its trials, which began on 27 December 1996. As of 16 February, 12 genocide cases had been tried, with 11 Category One defendants given death sentences and one Catergory Two defendant given life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda, fiercely critical of the ICTR, is bitter that the international court does not have a mandate to impose the death penalty, yet it is judging some of the alleged ringleaders of the genocide. &quot;It would be better for the ICTR to disband completely and the money used for rehabilitation schemes such as helping widows and orphans in our country,&quot; Gahima believes. He explains the rapidity of the trials by the fact that Rwanda's legal system is &quot; different&quot;. Witnesses are not cross-examined, having made their statement in writing beforehand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gahima also rejects international criticism that defendants have no time to prepare their cases nor access to legal representation. He says Rwanda has no resources for providing defence lawyers but if foreign groups want to become involved they can operate in complete freedom. &quot;Why should Rwanda delay its trials just because there are no defence lawyers?&quot; he says. &quot;This means that thousands of people would go unpunished for the crimes they have committed and it would send the wrong signal to the people.&quot; For the same reason, Rwanda is unable to provide witness protection, an issue which human rights monitors say must be resolved following numerous instances of murder and attacks on vulnerable groups such as genocide survivors and judicial personnel. Many witnesses have refused to testify out of fear or have been forced to move for their own security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the first cases in Kibungo, Kigali and Byumba last year in which the first two (unrepresented) defendants were sentenced to death (there is a 15- day appeal procedure), Rwanda seems to have to taken some of the criticism on board to a certain extent and foreign lawyers have now been invited to represent the accused. A case in point is that of one of the most notorious defendants undergoing trial in Kigali. Froduald Karamira, a former politician and businessman, was arrested at Addis Ababa airport and extradited to Rwanda last June while trying to flee during a stopover of a flight bringing him back from India. Allegedly one of the chief instigators of the genocide in the Kigali area, he was represented by a Beninois lawyer provided by the independent jurists' association, Avocats Sans Frontieres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-day trial, which had been adjourned and resumed on 29 January 1997 to a packed courtroom, was highly emotionally charged. Despite a pronouncement by the judge that displays of jeering, clapping or laughing were forbidden, this went unchecked by the court. The trial itself was surprising with the defence lawyer finally announcing he was delivering his client to the will of the Rwandan people, and that Karamira should ask their forgiveness. He asked for Karamira to be spared the death penalty, while the defendant himself told the court that if his death would help bring about national reconciliation then so be it. Karamira was convicted and sentenced to death on February 14 and given 15 days to appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coupled with the emotion of the trials, are the sheer physical restrictions of the courtrooms. Rwanda says the courts of first instance, where the genocide trials are being heard, have been sufficiently improved to enable the cases to go ahead. But the fact remains that the courtrooms were never intended to deal with cases of this magnitude and they remain small, cramped and uncomfortable, lacking in ventilation and amenities. Seating is provided by low benches, occupied for the most part by lawyers, journalists, civil damages claimants, human rights monitors and diplomatic representatives. Any standing room is taken up by members of the public. Often, the trials continue throughout the day without a break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trials in Rwanda beg the question of whether fair justice can be meted out by a court essentially made up of lawyers and magistrates (predominantly of one ethnic group) without recourse to a jury. This is an issue of grave concern to HRFOR which is closely monitoring the progress of justice in Rwanda. While welcoming the start of the trials, HRFOR expressed anxiety over the lack of legal representation both for defendants and civil claimants who may not know the extent of their rights, as well as other fair trial guarantees. HRFOR has also pointed out that Rwanda is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and was therefore bound by article 14 which entitles a defendant &quot;to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence and to communicate with counsel of his own choosing . . . &quot; HRFOR admits it has little influence over the course of events. An HRFOR official stressed it was up to the international community, especially donor countries, to bring pressure to bear on the Rwandan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government response is still awaited to a project proposal put forward by Rwandan and foreign lawyers concerning legal representation for civil claimants and defendants, in which it is stressed that counsel must be available to instruct them of possible avenues of appeal. To this end, the lawyers suggested creating a Legal Representation Agency as a central body to harness resources aimed at providing legal counsel, acting independently of the government. Foreign lawyers would be recruited to train Rwandan legal practitioners, drawn mainly from law graduates and students. The proposal, at an estimated cost of $1,744,500, pointed out that any attempts to provide counsel for defendants must be accompanied by a public awareness campaign to sensitise people to the right to defence and representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda itself instituted screening commissions known as Commissions de Triage, favoured in theory by human rights monitors. The commissions were an attempt to avoid summary justice by examining the cases of detainees at prefectural and commune level. Although the inspector of judicial police, IPJ, is responsible for judicial investigations, the government was forced to revise the composition of the commissions to include the prosecutor as well as representatives of the RPA, the gendarmerie, and intelligence services.  This too backfired, however, as there was rarely a quorum and decisions were pronounced invalid. Released suspects were rearrested. The commissions were initially scrapped, but have just been given another lease of life by the UN Development Programme in Kigali which is helping to relaunch them as &quot; Commissions de Triage Specialisees&quot;. UNDP was previously involved in providing support to the commissions in the form of equipment, vehicles and computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICTR, established by Security Council Resolution 955 (Footnote 2) on 8 November 1994, has come under strong international criticism for being slow and ineffective. In a press briefing last September, outgoing Prosecutor, Judge Richard Goldstone, pointed out that the main problems had been starting up, lack of secure funding and bureaucratic tussles. Recruitment had to be carried out through the United Nations, he said, and qualified staff were mostly unwilling to work in Arusha and in Kigali, where the Prosecutor's Office is situated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tribunal is still under-staffed, resources are scant (the press room has just one telephone) and Arusha is an unlikely venue for an international tribunal because of poor communications and complicated logistics. However, Judge Goldstone stressed that the Security Council had taken an important step from the perspective of international humanitarian law in setting up the Tribunal. He commended the Council for making &quot;the very brave link&quot; between restoring peace and restoring justice. As a judicial institution, the Tribunal is independent of any nation or group, including the Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite many setbacks, and a highly critical recent UN report on its management, the ICTR - whose six judges currently have a four year term from June 1995 - has an important role to play in enforcing international law and rendering fair justice. Its Statute guarantees that defendants are innocent until proven guilty. They have the right to legal assistance and the right against self-incrimination. Individuals cannot be tried in absentia, neither can they be sentenced to death. The Tribunal believes it is of the utmost importance to demonstrate equitable treatment to both the defence and the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resolution 978 (Footnote 3) of 27 February 1995 calls on UN member states to arrest and detain suspects on their territory and the Tribunal is mandated to take precedence over national courts, which has led to accusations by Rwanda of invasion of its national sovereignty. The Rwandan government has also criticised the Tribunal for not making its own indictments, alleging these have been carried out at the request of other countries. A statement by Avocats Sans Frontieres called for extending the ICTR mandate to include the possibility of ruling on claims for damages sought by genocide victims. The statement voiced concern that the mandate was restricted to judging the events which actually took place and not the widely-supported theory that the genocide had been planned long before the massacres occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thirst for vengeance in Rwanda is understandable, as is the feeling of frustration that those considered to be the main inciters of the massacres will never die for their crimes. It will be difficult for genocide survivors to reconcile this with statements that impunity must be eradicated, when they feel that at the very worst these &quot;big fish&quot; will get life imprisonment.  Because of this, upholding the credibility of the ICTR to those most involved - the Rwandans - will be very difficult. As the trial of the first defendant Jean-Paul Akayesu, the former mayor of Taba commune in Gitarama prefecture, resumed on 9 January this year, Rwanda had already convicted two people to death. The Akayesu trial is expected to last some eight weeks during which 31 witnesses, who can be cross-examined, are set to give evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the appearance of witnesses for the first time in Arusha, the importance of security has increased several-fold. To this effect, a witness protection unit has been established within the ICTR charged with upholding the security measures agreed by the court. These include using pseudonyms when referring to witnesses to conceal their identity, forbidding the filming, sketching or photographing of witnesses while on the premises of the ICTR and excluding any identifying data from public court records. The issue of protecting witnesses is very sensitive and ICTR officials are not keen to elaborate on the measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A growing number of attacks and murders in Taba commune as the date of the Akayesu trial approached, illustrates the crucial need for witness protection.  According to the local authorities, in one murder incident, the victim, a shopkeeper, had given testimony to local judicial officials and the ICTR.  Other potential witnesses have been intimidated to the point that they are no longer willing to give evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major concern now is that the mass return of refugees from Tanzania and Zaire, including ex-FAR/Interahamwe infiltrators and genocide suspects, may undermine attempts to redress the legal system. In 1996, an estimated 227 genocide survivors were killed, most of them in the volatile western prefectures bordering Zaire. Human rights monitors found that most of those responsible for the killings were ex-FAR/Interahamwe or other insurgents opposed to the government. Following the November-December arrival of over a million refugees from Zaire and Tanzania, HRFOR received reports that returnees were implicated in such attacks. Rwanda's emergent legal process could be thrown into jeopardy if killings of genocide survivors spiral out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda recognises, however, that it cannot continue throwing people into jail withourb trial. Since the mass return there has been an inevitable increase in arrests: 5,000 according to the Rwandan government, 7,000 according to HRFOR. Many people have turned themselves in for their own protection. Additionally, a large number of arrests were arbitrarily carried out when returnees arrived in their communes, HRFOR said. Prison conditions have been described as appalling and HRFOR says it has noticed a deterioration in the ill-treatment of detainees. While also expressing outrage over the extra-judicial executions of four genocide suspects by members of the RPA in December, HRFOR has welcomed the trial of an RPA officer implicated in the April 1995 Kibeho camp killings, as a step in the right direction for Rwandan justice. Lt.Col Fred Ibingira, who commanded troops sent in to close the camp, was found guilty of failing to protect the lives of civilians. The Military Court sentenced him to 18 month's imprisonment but given the time spent in pre-trial custody he was considered to have served his term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elimination of impunity is essential to ensure that the cycle of genocide is broken in Rwanda. National reconciliation will only be brought about when justice is seen to be done. In this context, the ongoing trials in Arusha and Rwanda must be supported. Rwanda has to find a balance between satisfying the demands of its people for speedy justice and demonstrating fair procedures to the outside world. The ICTR must not be allowed to procrastinate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While doubting that the main architects of the genocide feel any remorse for their actions, many Tutsis accept that they have to live side by side with their Hutu neighbours again, despite feelings of suspicion and mistrust.  The tentative steps towards national reconciliation and rehabilitation must be respected and sensitively handled. Also, how long will it take for Rwandans to feel vindicated while many of the truly &quot;big fish&quot; are still at large, escaping justice? The Rwandan genocide was one of the worst instances of crimes against humanity this century and the international community has a duty in helping bring the perpetrators to justice and maintaining assistance and observation of the trials, whose success is vital if peace and stability is ever to return to the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Footnotes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Organic Law of 30 August 1996 was promulgated to close the gap in Rwandan legislation which had no specific provision for punishing genocide and crimes against humanity. The law is limited to events that occurred between 1 October 1990 and 31 December 1994. People accused of genocide are classified according to four categories: Category 1 is sub- divided into four groups comprising a) the planners, organisers, instigators, supervisors and leaders of genocide or a crime against humanity b) people in positions of authority at national, prefectural, communal, sector or cellule level, or in a political party, the army, religious organisations or in a militia who perpetrated or fostered such crimes c) notorious murderers who by virtue of the zeal or excessive malice with which they committed atrocities, distinguished themselves in their areas of residence or wherever they passed d) persons who committed acts of sexual torture. Category 2 is made up of persons whose criminal acts or whose acts of criminal participation place them among perpetrators, conspirators or accomplices of intentional homicide or serious assault against person, causing his/her death. Category 3 is classified as people whose criminal acts or acts of criminal participation make them guilty of other serious assaults against the person. Category 4 comprises people who committed offences against property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (PANA) - Slavery in Africa supposedly ended when Mauritania officially proscribed the trade in humans around 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the belief by African states that all forms of the practice have ended on the continent may be flawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Classical slavery of people in chains has ended but new forms of servitude have emerged, mostly affecting children,&quot; says Cleophas Mally, the director of Wao-Afrique in Lome, Togo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency's brief is to stop child exploitation and promote peace in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the new forms of slavery in Africa manifest themselves in early and forced marriages, exploitation of child labor, the mortgaging of children by their indebted parents and the female genital mutilation of young girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although Africans now refuse to admit the existence of the problem, we in Togo have witnessed the illegal repatriation of young girls to middle revenue countries such as Gabon and Cameroon,&quot; Mally told PANA in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is attending a sub-regional meeting on children's rights, education and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brokers are usually Togolese women living in Gabon. They discuss with the girls' parents and promise a better life for their children when they are employed as maids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Knowing very well that these girls' parents are far away, their employers flagrantly violate their rights. Some of them even transform the girls into prostitutes,&quot; Mally said. Other, he said, tell parent that they are taking their daughters to neighbouring Benin as maids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then, unknown to the parents, some of the girls end up as slaves in Lebanon,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mally said before he left Lome Friday, two Beninese women were being questioned by police for attempting to smuggle out three school girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women had approached a school teacher for the purpose of obtaining one of her pupils. The teacher leaked the affair to Wao-Afrique which, in turn, alerted the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under questioning it became clear that the Beninese women had sought to obtain permits of safe passage for three girls,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mally said Wao-Afrique does not know how many girls have been forced into slavery, &quot;but we are seeking the services of a consultant to unravel the network of children traffickers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mally says Wao-Afrique will begin to pressure legislators for them to pass legislation protecting children's rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency also wants the speedy rate ratification of the 1989 convention of child labor by countries where it has chapters: Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Niger, Senegal and Togo. Its Burundi and Rwanda chapters have been closed due to the ethnic-related mayhem which started in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However Mally said, &quot;We also managed to convince the Banjul-based African Human and People's Rights Commission to accept in principle that new forms of slavery have emerged. Preparation are a foot for a seminar on the problem, to be organized by the Inter-African Human Rights Union.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flooding prompted the air force to join South Africa's in rescue operations in the affected areas, after an appeal for help Friday by Mozambican Foreign Minister Leonardo Siamo.</SPAN></P>

They are giving food aid to the affected people with the help of the Air Force of Zimbabwe which should, by the end of the week, have distributed at least 40 tons of food aid to the Mozambicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwean rescue team is led by Sqd. Ldr. Mike Dhabha. it has been struggling to provide aid to affected people because it is having to travel around Mozambique without maps and having to use mountains as well as other prominent physical features as route markers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dhabha said the continuous rains were also a major drawback to their efforts as more people were being trapped from time to time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to move fast because there might be a bigger disaster looming with the opening up of the flooding Cahora Bassa Dam which is full to capacity,&quot; he said. &quot;All that water will come along this place into the Zambezi and then to the Indian ocean and that would really be a big disaster,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tambara villagers told the Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency, Ziana, they were thankful to Zimbabwe for the aid as Mozambique was one of the poorest African nations and lacked the capacity to deal with such disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are struggling because of these rains and not even a single plane from our government has been able to reach us,&quot; said Kuluzado Semuneti at the sight of Zimbabwe helicopters. He said the villagers feared the outbreak of diseases which would lead to more deaths. Provincial residents are surviving on sweet potatoes, bananas and fish which were being thrown to the shores by the continuous rains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Air Force has extended its rescue operations in to Mozambique's second largest city, Beira. The city has been cut off from the rest of the country, forcing thousands of residents fleeing their homes after heavy flooding in Manica and Sofala provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Floods have also swept through parts of Malawi where thousands are reportedly homeless, prompting President Bakili Muluzi to declare a national disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mutare-Beira road, from the Zimbabwe border town to the Mozambican port city, has also been cut off by the flooded Pungwe River. It has also left thousands of people homeless and INL002 from SSS.064 (970220-18:00) QN PANAINL .PANADKR MSG063G/02E PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PAN(2) destroyed at least 8,000 hectares of cropland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In three weeks of non-stop rains in Zambia's Southern Province, at least 3, 000 people have been left homeless and maize stalks worth 25,000 U.S. dollars washed away by torrential rains. Villagers have been forced to live with breast height waters in their homes and and hundreds of cattle have drowned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No official figures for deaths or injures have been made public, so far.  However, a village headman in New Kazungula District, Richard Mampwe, told a government team that some people may have died because some villagers without canoes had been stranded in their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in a very desperate situation. All our crops are gone and some of our villages are collapsing because of these rains,&quot; a resident, Richard Syalumba, was quoted as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last two days, 300 people in Kafue, south of the Lusaka, the Zambian capital, have also been left homeless after their houses collapsed following torrential rains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like other Southern African countries, Zambia, which experienced a severe drought in the 1993-1994 season, has been inundated with rain which has submerged and destroyed some maize fields. Maize is the stable for most of the subregion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, described in 1993 as the worst performer among emerging indices, was last year placed fourth among the 25 countries listed in the economist magazine's emerging markets table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market was only exceeded by Hungary, Russia and Venezuela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's key industrial index, which this year surpassed the 10,000 mark for the first time in the history of the stockmarket, in 1996 rose by 121 percent, an increase of 89.5 percent in United States dollar terms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It exceeded all of the leading stockmarkets in the world which collectively grew in us dollar terms with the exception of Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volumes in 1996 were also significantly higher with 722.6 million shares (up 78.6 percent on 1995) trading for zimdollars 2.5 billion (about USD 226 million) up 96.6 percent compared with the volume in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winners outstripped losers by 54 to 19, with some of the smaller cap companies showing remarkable gains as well as solid performances from some of the heavyweights such as Edgars which rose 237.8 percent; Barclays 185.7 percent; Delta, 143.6 percent; TSL 127.7 percent; Hippo Valley estates 83 percent; and Portland Holdings which rose by 66.7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten best performing counters in 1996 were CIH followed by Zimpapers, Tedco, Chemco, Meikles, Clan, Ariston, African Distillers, UDC and Zimbabwe Sugar Refineries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falcon warrants topped the list of 10 worst performers, which also included Bicc Cafca, Art, Mhangura Copper Mines, National Foods, Bindura, Falgold, Falcon, and Flexible Packaging preferences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign investors continued to be very active in the market, with the total combined purchases and sales for 1996 amounting to ZD 1.62 billion (about USD 147 million), resulting in a net inflow of ZD 70.2 million (about USD 6.3 million) despite some profit taking towards the end of the year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Provisional estimates show that the Ghana's economy grew by 5.2 per cent in 1996, slightly better than the projected five percent growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Finance Kwame Peprah, who announced this in Parliament while presenting the 1997 budget, said Wednesday this was accounted for by a 4 percent growth in agriculture, 4.2 per cent growth in the industrial sector and 6.3 per cent growth in the services sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said inflation dropped from 70.8 percent in December 1995 to 32.6 per cent in December 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provisional out-turn for 1996 recorded a deficit of 142 billion cedis (81 million U.S. dollars), equivalent to about 1 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This compared with a projected surplus of 158.7 billion cedis or 1.5 of GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said receipts were 2,268.5 billion cedis (1.29 billion dollars) while expenditures were 2,410.5 billion cedis (1.37 billion dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peprah said the deficit was caused by the &quot;many challenges&quot; in managing the fiscal programme during the year under review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said new salary levels negotiated led to a higher than programmed wage bill while the non-disbursement or programmed foreign inflows of 60 million dollars presented obstacles to the achievement of the projected surplus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a tendency for the donor community and investors alike to adopt a wait-and-see attitude in an election year,&quot; he said. &quot;This appears to have happened last year and had a telling effect on revenues and receipts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the sectoral performances, he said the crops and livestock sub-sector grew by 6 percent while there were improved growth rates in the forestry, logging and fishing sub-sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the manufacturing sector grew by 3.3 percent led by a recovery in beverage production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the supply of potable water to the rural areas, and the rehabilitation of water supply systems in some urban centers coupled with the provision of rural electrification, had led to a continued growth in the electricity and water sub-sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Road construction by government and activities of private real estate developers and individuals resulted amounted in a 6.1 percent growth for the construction sub-sector. Mining and quarrying grew by 4.2 per cent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town Cape Town's Olympic plan is &quot;very well thought out&quot;, showing &quot; impressive depth of analysis and planning&quot;, the International Olympic Committee concludes in a detailed and positive assessment of the bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial, transport and accommodation plans are singled out for praise, and though the report highlights the &quot;serious crime situation facing the country&quot;, it notes that &quot;through co-operation involving all responsible parties, significant plans and a detailed strategy have been developed in order to reduce crime and increase the level of safety and security&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These comments are contained in the evaluation commission's report on Cape Town's bid, due to be released today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial news agency reports summarising IOC assessments of all 11 bidding cities gave a more negative impression, and this was rebutted today by Bid Company chief executive Chris Ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the report was encouraging because &quot;there are no major negatives and many compliments&quot;. The assessment contained some errors which the Bid Company had until next Friday to clarify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of these was a reference to a rand figure misconstrued as a dollar figure which led the evaluation commission to believe that revenue items &quot; appear to be on the high side&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highlights of the report are that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The overall plan &quot;is very well thought out, making particular use of the expertise of the business community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* There is &quot;an impressive depth of analysis and planning which even could be improved more by closer co-operation with sports experts&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Plans for the Olympic Village are &quot;good generally&quot;, the rowing course being a &quot;very good facility&quot; which would leave a &quot;great legacy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The environmental programme &quot;sets ambitious goals and covers a wide range of issues&quot;, would involve &quot;a high degree of public participation and close co- operation between the Olympic organisers, NGOs and communities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Transport infrastructure and plans &quot;are thorough and detailed&quot;, demonstrating &quot;an impressive awareness of Olympic needs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The financial plan &quot;demonstrates professional involvement and an in-depth approach, providing ample reserves...thus demonstrating a basically conservative approach&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Guarantees are in general &quot;detailed and precise&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ball said he believed Cape Town would rank &quot;a confident fourth&quot; in the shortlist to be announced on March 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correspondent Gary Lemke reports that National Olympic Committee of South Africa chairman Sam Ramsamy dispelled fears that the bid could be knocked off course by the IOC's concerns about crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are aware of the strengths and weaknesses in the Cape Town bid and we are confident that we will overcome those weaknesses and turn them into strengths,&quot; said Mr Ramsamy today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are aware of the crime the IOC is referring to and we have structures in place to rectify the situation. We have plenty of time on our side to turn things around and I'm not particularly concerned about the details mentioned in the report.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Italo-Ethiopian Scenario, 1935</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia, the victor of the battle of Adwa in 1896, was by the early twentieth century the only state in Africa to have survived the European Scramble for the continent. The country was, however, dangerously situated between two Italian coastal colonies, Eritrea and Somalia. These territories could scarcely be developed in isolation from the Ethiopian hinterland, or expanded other than at Ethiopia's expense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adwa had been a turning point in the history of Ethio-Italian relations.  Italy, prior to the battle, had sought to gain control of Ethiopia, first through Article 17 of the Wechale Treaty, and later through military action.  After the battle the Italians turned, no less assiduously, to economic penetration. Such Italian ambitions had been accepted, as we have seen, by Ethiopia's two colonial neighbours, Britain and France, who, by the Tripartite Convention of 1906, had recognised an Italian economic sphere of influence linking Eritrea and Somalia, west of Addis Ababa. The French, who regarded Ethiopia as important for the prosperity of their Somaliland protectorate, and wished to be in good relations with Ethiopia's ruler, later veered away from the 1906 formula as far as Italy's sphere of influence was concerned. The British, on the other hand, continued as late as 1925 to accept the principle of an Italian sphere of influence over most of Ethiopia in exchange for Italy's support for a proposed British dam at Lake Tana.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rise of Fascism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy's colonial ambitions in Africa were almost inevitably affected by Benito Mussolini's seizure of power in 1922, and the resultant emergence in Rome of a militaristic, and intensely chauvinist, regime. It was only a matter of time before the fascist state would shift Italian policy once more from economic to military penetration, and call on the people of Italy to &quot; revenge Adwa&quot;, by embarking on a new war of conquest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations between the two countries were, however, at first superficially cordial. When Ras Tafari visited Rome in 1924 he was warmly welcomed by Mussolini. The fascist dictator, as his wife Donna Rachele recalls, then foresaw a &quot;great future for Italy in Abyssinia&quot;, and conceived the idea of &quot; developing Abyssinia with Italian labour&quot;. He found his Ethiopian visitor &quot;a clever and cultured man&quot;, with whom he believed he could 'get on very well'.  With this in mind the Duce sponsored the 1928 Treaty of Friendship and Arbitration in the hope of achieving rapid Italian economic penetration through the port of Asab and a proposed Italian- road to Dase. When, however, it became apparent that the Ethiopian Government would not accept any infringement of its sovereignty, the Italian fascists turned their thoughts from peaceful pressure to outright war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Bono</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first steps for the new invasion were taken by Marshal Emilio De Bono, an elderly fascist holding the post of Minister of the Colonies. On 22 January 1930 he wrote a confidential letter to the President of the Italian Council of Ministers, asking for a major increase in the budget for the Italian colonies bordering Ethiopia. It would be &quot;harmful to embark on large expenditure&quot;, and &quot;ridiculous to speak of the Romanity of the Empire&quot;, he added, &quot;if expansion (his emphasis) beyond the confines of the Fatherland was not considered possible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of a military operation was warmly accepted by Mussolini, who argued that war could rejuvenate the Italian people, and be an objective in itself. Accordingly, in the Spring of 1932, he despatched De Bono to Eritrea &quot; to see how matters stood there&quot;. On the minister's return the two fascist leaders agreed that their country's &quot;colonial future must be sought in East Africa&quot;, where Italy had a &quot;hinterland&quot; i.e. Ethiopia, &quot;which could be profitably exploited&quot; De Bono thereupon drew up a &quot;definite programme&quot; in relation to the &quot;possibilities of war&quot; which, he later recalled, &quot;had to be regarded not only as possible, but as always increasingly probable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Bono's Revelations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Bono, in 1932-3, wrote memorandum after memorandum requesting increased military personnel and supplies for Eritrea and Somalia, and had several secret conversations on Ethiopia with his fascist master. Discussing his own attitude in 1933, he recalls: &quot;It had been my proudest dream to end my public career as a soldier on public service. Of course, it was not yet possible to say in 1933 - the year in which we began to consider what practical steps must be taken in the event of war with Ethiopia - whether there would or would not be a war in that country; but I made up my mind to lose no time, and one day I said to the Duce: 'Listen: if there is to be a war down there - and you think me worthy of it, and capable - you ought to grant me the honour of conducting the campaign'. The Duce looked at me hard, and at once replied: 'Surely!' 'You don't think me too old', I added. 'No', he replied, 'because we mustn't lose time'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From that moment&quot;, De Bono continues, &quot;the Duce was definitely of the opinion that the matter would have to be settled no later than 1936, and he told me as much. I confined myself to replying: 'Very good!' - without expressing the faintest doubt as to the possibility that this could be achieved (De Bono's emphasis)...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the autumn of 1933. The Duce had spoken to no one of the coming operations in East Africa; only he and I knew what was going to happen, and no indiscretion occurred by which the news could reach the public&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fascist strategy from 1933 onwards was based, De Bono explains, very largely on political subversion in Ethiopia, designed at achieving the country's complete disintegration. He informed the Duce that this would &quot;not be a very difficult task&quot;, provided they worked &quot;well on political lines&quot;, and that disintegration 'could be regarded as certain after a military victory on our part'&quot;. Mussolini, he adds, &quot;thought as I did, and ordered me 'to go full speed ahead', I must be ready as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Money (De Bono said) will be needed, Chief; lots of money'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'There will be no lack of money', the Duce replied&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political Subversion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italian agents were thereafter actively engaged in the attempted subversion of Ethiopian chiefs, and nobles, who were given lavish bribes. Action was also taken to forment ethnic tension, particularly in militarily strategic areas in the north and south of the country, notably in eastern Wallo, Ogaden and Hararge. Emperor Haile Sellassie commented at the time that he knew that many of his chiefs were accepting Italian money, but was confident that when the testing time came they would not betray Ethiopia. Later he declared, with unusual bitterness, in his Autobiography, that the Italians had &quot;always been the bane of the Ethiopian people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Changing Stance of France</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rise of Hitler and nazi Germany's attempt to overturn the paramount world position of Britain and France, the victors of World War I, or &quot; satisfied powers&quot; as he called them, had important implications for Ethiopia.  The French, and to a lesser extent the British, came to see &quot;dissatisfied&quot; nazi Germany as a potential threat to their hegemony. They therefore became increasingly reluctant to take any stand against Mussolini, lest it drove him into the hands of the Germans, to whom he was, however, already linked by a common militaristic, and &quot;fascist&quot;doctrine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such thinking led to a major re-orientation on the part of France. Hitherto, as we have seen, she had regarded Ethiopia as a valuable 'hinterland' for Jibuti, and had supported Ethiopian independence against the predatory pressures of Italy, and to a lesser extent Britain. The French Government, becoming increasingly concerned with the situation in Europe, now, however, changed its policy. To please Mussolini, it began to withdraw opposition to Italian expansion in Ethiopia, and proposed that Italy in return should waive its interests in the French colony of Tunisia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Yohannes Asrat's ambition in life is to build a large sports centre where street children especially can develop their talent. For Yohannes, the main coach at the gymnasium at the IBEX Hotel recreation centre, it is a constant irritation to do nothing but walk past highly talented youngsters on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yohannes has been at his present post since 1993 and feels that Ethiopians are beginning to take exercise seriously. If you look at the way everyone follows sports events in this country, he remarked, you can see that the interest is there. However, the lack of proper facilities have put a damper on things for some time. That is not to say that everything is perfect now.  Proper facilities are still hard to come by, but people are queuing up to use what is available. &quot;A lot of people come at first because the doctors have told them they need to lose weight&quot; he noted, &quot; But once they see the result, they are quick to press friends to join.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent rise in interest in exercise, especially by the older generation is evident to all, but to experts such as Yohannes they highlight the pressing need for centres that are not likely to be built in the near future.  These constraints were always on his mind during his many years' involvement in the country's sport scene. From 1988-1992 Yohannes was head of culture and sports affairs desk and bureau at the office of the council of ministers.  Before then, he worked in the commission for physical culture and sports affairs as physical culture and mass sports chief expert and mass sport and physical fitness trainer. He also acted as trainer for an adult women's group in the former Y.M.C.A. Though some may argue that mass sport is nothing but socialistic propaganda, Yohannes firmly believes he was not wasting his time and remembers those years with some fondness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many complain that physical education classes are not what they used to be.  &quot;It would not be fair to compare sport periods when I was in school with the present situation. The student teacher ratio was good then and facilities were readily available. It was no wonder that students could make the national team.&quot; Yohannes did try to do something about the present situation when he worked at the ministry of education as physical education and sports expert as well as physical education and sports curriculum producer, programmer, co-ordinator and chief expert. It is not only the congestion of schools that is a problem, but the total disregard given to sport by some schools. &quot;I have seen buildings erected in the middle of playing fields,&quot; Yohannes exclaimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yohannes was born in 1944 in Gondar. In 1957 he received his eighth grade certificate and was placed in the Harar Teachers' Training Institute. &quot;I wanted to join the technical school and go on to study maybe engineering,&quot; he recalled. Four years later he graduated from the institute and taught at the Amgageorgis Elementary School. He had always had a passion for sports and in the two years he spent at the school, Yohannes did his best to get the children to participate. &quot;There were many balls just sitting in storage so I decided to put up a net in the playground and train the kids in my spare time.  &quot; In 1964 he decided to join the Addis Ababa University and study for a diploma in physical education, health and recreation. Upon receiving the diploma in 1966, Yohannes joined a junior high school in Sebeta area as physical education and academic teacher. A year later he left the school to study for his degree in school administration and supervision from the Addis Ababa University. Some of the credits from his diploma course were counted in his favour and Yohannes managed to get his degree in three years and join the ministry of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1979 Yohannes left for what was then East Germany to get his Masters in general physical education, sports management and planning. The lessons were all given in German and at first Yohannes found the language hard. &quot;There were many instances in the first couple of months when I was ready to quit and come back home. But the teachers were very helpful and by following their suggestions I began to feel more comfortable with the language,&quot; he said. It was not just a third language and a Masters degree that Yohannes picked up in Germany. His two years stay there had a profound impact on his attitude to life, particularly in the way he handles problems. For Yohannes, destiny is not what is dished out to us, but what we make of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yohannes Asrat is a widower and has three children. His hobbies include reading anything he can get his hands on, especially materials dealing with sports.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - A new draft proclamation concerning a 'road fund' to act as a financial source for the maintenance of roads and road safety was discussed at a public meeting Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government English daily quoted the general manager of the Ethiopian Roads Authority Ato Tesfamichael Nahu-Senai as saying that the country's road network was the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of the road fund rests on the principle that users should pay for services. Other sources will include budget allocated by the government, road maintenance fuel levy, annual vehicle licence renewal fee based on axle load, overloading fine. A road Board accountable to the prime minister's office will be set up made up of federal, regional government, and road users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ato Tesfamichael, 95 per cent of the freight and 97 per cent of the public transport rely on surface transportation network. The government is negotiating with creditors a ten-year prospective plan costing 24 billion birr for the expansion and maintenance of the country's roads.  Around 900,000,000 birr out of the total cost is expected to be covered by the government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Completed infrastructure improvement project undertaken jointly by CARE Ethiopia, the residents of Kebele 18, and Region 14 was inaugurated in an elaborate ceremony Saturday 15 February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kebele residents covered 30,000 birr out of the project's total cost of 1,022,07.52 birr. The tasks accomplished are impressive by any standard, and as Mr. Ian Mclsaac, vice chairman of CARE noted, it was, &quot;an example of commitment and dedication of people.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new roads are a great improvement from the old muddy and rocky ones Mr.  Robin Needham, country director of CARE Ethiopia pointed out, adding that petty crimes was reported to have dropped and a sense of community developed.  &quot;Every time I come,&quot; he said, &quot;I am constantly surprised and impressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activities accomplished were:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stone paved road ways --2076 linear mts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">road construction with select material -- l 584 linear mts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rain water drainage ditch -- 2128 meters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">retaining walls -- 31 m cubed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">small vehicular culverts -- 14 PCs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pipe culverts -- 12 PCs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">foot crossings -- 49 PCs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bridges -- 1 Pc</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manholes/catch pits -- 12 PCs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pedestrian bridge -- PCs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 454 residents found employment with the Community Infrastructure Improvement/Urban Food-For-Work project (CII/UFFW) and indirectly benefited some 2724, a press release from CARE Ethiopia stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is good news for a community that has seventy-five per cent of its population earning under 250 birr a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those who worked on the project for the past eleven months is Retta, 21, who has been unemployed for the last three years. The fifth out of ten children, he is the only one to have finished high school. &quot;I wanted to study medicine,&quot; he sadly recalled, but his exam results were not good enough for university -- so he was forced to go looking for odd jobs. The family only had two meagre sources of income -- his late father's pension, and what his mother got working as a day labourer for the municipality. Retta was seriously contemplating joining a neighbourhood gang when the CII/UFFW project was initiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Involvement in the project has done wonders for Retta's financial and psychological well-being. But when asked about his future plans, his face looked bleak and he could only answer that he would have to go back to looking for odd jobs again. The majority of the families in the kebele are headed by women, mostly widows of soldiers. The CII/UFFW project has meant a lot to them. The wide roads mean that the fire brigade and ambulance can be called in. The income from working on the project has meant a better standard of living. &quot;We have been eating well this eleven months,&quot; one woman said, &quot; but we don't know what we will do now that it is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Community Infrastructure Improvement/Urban Food-For-Work program has been undertaken in 28 kebeles in Addis Ababa out of which 23 are competed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - We have no official statistics but there is a consensus that the value of exports has been declining; foreign investment is negligible; foreign reserves have also been going down. Foreign exchange in Ethiopia is still an extremely scarce resource.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all this, there is some good news.  As our economic correspondent reports, the world coffee price is on the rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, coffee is trading at 160 US cents per pound compared to 120 US cents per pound a few months ago. Even with the 33 per cent increase, the earnings from coffee exports will not cover all our requirements of foreign currency. In fact, coffee is the most important single export commodity. In 1996, sixty-two per cent of our total export earnings was from coffee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In THE EAST ASIAN MIRACLE, macroeconomic stability and rapid export growth were two key elements in starting the virtuous circle of high rates of accumulation, efficient allocation, and strong productivity growth that formed the basis for their success. Governments achieved macroeconomic stability by adhering to orthodox policy prescriptions -- in particular, by holding budget deficits to levels that could be prudently financed. They achieved rapid export growth through an export push -- a combination of orthodox, market-oriented mechanisms, many linked to macroeconomic stability, and complementary pro-export incentives. It is not easy to achieve what the East Asians have achieved, but let us try.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Addis Ababa Chamber of Commerce (AACC) will be holding an election for president, vice president, and board members at its 20th general assembly Thursday next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole affair is scheduled to be opened by Ato Kassahun Ayele, minister of trade and industry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the minister and other invited guests have left, the chamber gets down to serious business as the AACC President, Ato Woubishet Workalemaw will give the annual report for the just ended Ethiopian year. The chamber has been involved in a dispute with Addis Ababa administration for the last couple of months over increases in rent of around 27,000 business premises. At a press conference held last week, Ato Woubishet stated the election will not mean a slackening in the chamber's effort for a resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The external auditor's report reveals an unexplained discrepancy in the Ethiopian years 1984, 1985 and 1986 between the sum supposed to be collected from the membership fees and what was actually put into the bank. According to the bookkeeping system of the chamber, membership dues are recorded from the member's list, and not when the actual amount is settled. Therefore, the auditors said that they could not tell whether the 7,644,729 birr membership dues at the end of the last budget year had been collected or not. Overall though, the report stated that the chamber's book showed that its income has consistantly been above its expense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - World Coffee prices have rebounded strongly in recent weeks.  Currently, the price of coffee on the New York commodities market is rising to the US cents 160/pound mark as compared to an average price of around 120 US cents/ pound a few months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several reasons are put forward for the current upsurge in world coffee prices, including a strike by dockworkers in Colombia, a major coffee producing country; a cut in export volume (about 1.3 million bags) agreed by the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) at their meeting in Rio de Janeiro in late January 1997; fast rising world demand which is expected to reach some 100 million bags this year; and reported damage to Brazil's 1996 coffee crop.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics on world coffee in recent weeks include the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1996/97 total world coffee production -- 97.26 million bags (bag=60kg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1995/96 total world coffee production -- 88.12 million bags</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1996/97 world production of unwashed arabicas -- 26.65 million bags</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1996/97 production of other mild coffees -- 25.35 million bags</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1996/97 World Robusta coffee production -- 31.83 million bags</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York March position on Feb. 4, 1997 -- US cents 144.25 per pound</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London March contract on Feb. 4, 1997 -- US dollar 1535 per tonne</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cut in coffee export volume agreed by ACPC -- 1.3 million bags</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ceiling for coffee exports set for Jan-June, 1997 before cut -- 26.28 million bags</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coffee export cut requested by African producers -- 2.5 million bags</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1996/97 Brazil's coffee production -- 17-21 million bags</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1995/96 Brazil coffee production -- 27 million bags</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estimated world coffee consumption for 1996/97 -- 100 million bags</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peak coffee price in 1994 -- US dollars 4000 per tonne</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Average coffee price in 1995/96 -- US dollars 1650 per tonne</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World coffee prices are expected to continue their upward movement on the strength of a very buoyant world demand for the commodity and the additional factors mentioned above. So, all this is good news for Ethiopia where coffee remains the most important single export commodity, accounting for over 62 percent of total export earnings in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provided coffee shipments are maintained at average levels, Ethiopia could obtain additional foreign exchange of anything between 350-500 million birr as a result of the current and expected future rise in world coffee prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This additional injection of purchasing power into the economy may be expected to have several first-round effects, including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* an increase in gross foreign reserves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a rise in broad money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* triggering inflationary pressures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* an increase in government revenue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second-round effect would tend to absorb the inflationary pressures caused by the monetary expansion through increased physical availabilities via imports. But this would at the same time reduce the rise in foreign reserves, the extent of the reduction being determined by the elasticity of demand for imports with respect to income, which in Ethiopia's case is believed to be fairly high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, all of the extra income from coffee could be spent on imports. Add to this the recent rising demand for foreign exchange which is likely to be partly underpinned by the expected improvement in the implementation of central government, regional and private-sector investment projects, which evidently require imported components and inputs. This would tend to exert pressure on the country's foreign reserves, causing the birr to depreciate further on the auction market unless donor governments and international organizations come to the rescue by replenishing the dwindling &quot; gold kitty&quot; with additional grants and confessional loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban on franco valuta imports (imports brought in with own foreign exchange) has slowed down the rise in official imports which can now be imported only by duly licensed and tax-paying importers who must also comply with requirements prescribed for participation in the weekly foreign exchange auction market, a far cry from the highly liberal franco valuta system where everybody who could obtain foreign exchange from sources other than the domestic banking system was able to import goods from abroad, and at a much faster pace than the letter-of- credit system is ever likely to match in the foreseeable future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the slowdown in the rate of import growth caused largely by administrative means is currently showing up as pent-up import demand, reflected not only in the continuous depreciation of the birr which now stands at 6.65 birr to the US dollar, but also on the forex black market where the exchange rate has been inching upwards, albeit ever sluggishly towards the 7.15 birr US dollar level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) may relieve the pressure on foreign exchange by supplying more of it on its auction market than the weekly 17 million US dollars it is now putting up for sale, but this can be done only as a temporary measure so long as the replenishment of the foreign reserve pouch fails to keep up with the increasing dollop of foreign exchange being auctioned off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concern about the continuous depreciation of the birr could become more agonizing when one realizes four worrying, recent developments: first, domestic credit expansion is currently accelerating so much that contrary to the situation only one or two months ago, excess domestic liquidity in the banking system has now been virtually wiped out and at least part of the incremental credit is likely to end up as letters of credit demanding foreign exchange; second, trends in the export sector have not been positive to the extent the pressure on forex would necessitate; third, the expected rise in foreign investment is still a long way from being realized in any perceptible way; fourth, as a result, the country is gradually getting &quot;hooked&quot; on foreign loans and grants to alleviate its basically chronic balance-of- payments constraints, which addiction would soon show up in the form of an increasing external debt burden, which would in turn continue to show up in another variant of the addiction, namely a constant craving for debt relief.  How could this vicious circle be broken?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let the government bureaucracy do what is rightfully its job, but let it refrain from unnecessarily interfering with the workings of the market, like, for example, making farmers produce maize nobody wants to buy, and at great cost, too! Let the bureaucracy first do its rightful job well enough, including getting its policies on land and nationalized properties right. The market should then be trusted to reallocate resources more towards the export sector, given the current exchange rate and other incentives, so that gradually the economy may be weaned away from drip-feeding by donor governments and international organizations. In the meantime, care should be taken not to be deceived by the emerging coffee boom into believing that the buoyancy the economy is expected to show as a result is the fruit of our industry and diligence, not just the same old, transient windfall that recurs every now and then on the upswing of the world coffee cycle!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The sad news came February 16 announcing the death of Eugene Chiavaroli, the representative for PACT Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his early career with USAID, Mr. Chiavaroli spent a large part in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He served as the USAID Affairs Officer in Nigeria, and as Mission Director in Mali. In 1994, Mr. Chiavaroli was the recipient for the Equal Opportunity Award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chiavaroli accompanied his wife, Arlene Jacquette, on her assignment to Ethiopia as the Public Relations Officer for the US Information Agency (USIA).  It is in this country that he became the representative for the newly- established PACT (Participating Agencies Collaborating Together) two years ago. PACT Ethiopia said Mr. Chiavaroli has personally been enthusiastic in bringing NGOs and communities together to cooperate in promoting their objectives. Mr. Chiavaroli was a strong supporter of Ethiopia and a close friend of Addis Tribune. Heartfelt condolences go out to Arlene Jacquette and family.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Nick Price had his first victory in 15 months last weekend, and he's hoping it will be the first of many this year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE'S a new lady in Nick Price's life. A fat one. And she has much to do with the Zimbabwean's changing fortune in tournament play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new fat lady is a derivative of the &quot;fat lady&quot; putter he used to such effect in his great years of 1993-4 when he grabbed the first of his three victories in the majors and swept virtually all before him taking over the world's number one spot from Greg Norman on the Sony rankings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that Price really takes much account of the rankings as a guideline to play. &quot;I think the time span is too long,&quot; is his thinking on the issue. &quot;The game is too immediate for that. It's how you are playing now that really counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even when I was world number one, I didn't think about it too much. I mean, what am I now? Around 20?&quot; When he was hastily told he was at 12, he grinned broadly. &quot;There you are. See what I mean?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then take Tiger Woods. He's one of the best players in the world right now and what is he? Down around 40 or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Price is unconcerned about where the world rankings place him, he is deadly serious about getting back to winning tournaments again. He showed this to telling effect by taking the field apart in the chaotic Dimension Data Pro-am at Sun City last week. And the new putter, though an important element, is just a part of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A very important part admittedly. &quot;It started coming back in Phoenix three weeks ago,&quot; he said. Price finished third there and followed that with a second place behind the elegant Fijian Vijay Singh in the South African Open at Glendower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm starting to get the line and pace back,&quot; he said. &quot;It's when you can roll in those 20-footers that you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly he knew in the Dimension Data when the last putt for a final round 69 and tournament score of 20-under went in as the gathering black of the African night began to finally cloak the Pilansberg hills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At that stage it didn't matter to me,&quot; said Price, grinning. &quot;I could see the hole perfectly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is certainly an exaggeration. In a lightning-bedevilled event that stretched into the gloom, Price was not a totally happy man at the end even with a winner's cheque of nearly half a million rand in his account amd a stretch of 15 months without a win behind him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, somthing will have to be done to the format at the Sun City tournament, which mixes professionals and amateurs over four days of tournament play. Price, inherant gentleman that he is, hinted at this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tempo of play could have been faster,&quot; was his cryptic assessment.  Inded. It took a shade over three hours for Price and Ireland's Padraigh Harrington to complete the first nine of a final day where weather was always going to be a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harrington suffered from the amateurs walking on his line and slowing play up to a crawl, and dropped shots on both the finishing holes in the half- light of encroaching nightfall as he and Price raced to the final green, hurrying the amateurs along. But then came the moment when the final putt - and night - fell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Price had broken his drought and was looking towards getting back on the winning trail in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is obviously a matter of concern to the American-based star. &quot;I know the critics will say that the win didn't come in the States,&quot; he said. &quot;But a win is a win anywhere, especially in a field of this strength. I think the way I am playing right now would have given me a chance to win anywhere in the world.&quot; Just so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is the old fire back in his eyes: Price has, for all the world, the cold-eyed glint of a gunslinger out on the course, a direct contrast to the easy amiability he invariably displays once he has packed his clubs away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One other major factor in Price taking a trophy for the first time since the Zimbabwe Open back in 1995 is that he has shaken off the nagging sinus problems which sapped his energy and concentration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really had a lousy year last year,&quot; he said. Another reminder of that was the hand-written message Price carried on the brim of his peaked cap. &quot;Hi Squeak&quot; it read, a message to his caddy Squeaky who was diagnosed as having cancer last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps that setback to the man who has partnered him for a major part of his career has also made Price even more determined than ever. &quot;My focus this year is definitely on the majors,&quot; said Price after leaving David Frost a distant eight shots behind at Sun City. &quot;If there is a major I would like to win it is the Masters. But I'll take any one I can get.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with the help of a fat lady totally in tune and a growing confidence, who would bet against Price grabbing a handful this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the Australian batting gets better in the run-up to the first Test, the need for more than one of South Africa's specialist batsmen to make big scores increases</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Australians will always be this country's biggest rivals on the cricket field. There is, quite simply, no side the South Africans want to beat more - coach Bob Woolmer has spelt this out more than once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, with the first Test at the Wanderers a little under a week away, Woolmer will be steeling himself and his side for the looming three-Test series. Woolmer and captain Hansie Cronje have a number of problems in getting the balance right against a side whose recent record is less than the Aussie public would like but which has been given an opportunity to bat themselves into form.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is one of those ironies of modern professional sport that it is often better to play away from home than to perform in your own back yard.  Certainly this must be true for Mark Taylor's tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, they may not be the first choice as crowd favourites and their reputation for turning sledging at the crease into an art form has not always endeared them to our packed terraces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then there is a distinct feeling that Taylor has done much to blunt the harsher points of Australian play and there is no Merv Hughes to wave a threatening bat at the local yobs on this tour. Even the ultra-competitive Shane Warne is showing a clean-cut image and saying some diplomatic things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We shall have to see if all this continues once the last of the warm-up games - a one- dayer against a Transvaal Invitation XI at the Soweto Oval next Tuesday - is out of the way and the real stuff begins in earnest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With doubts over the match fitness of Brian McMillan and the growing confidence of the Australians at the crease, Woolmer will have to do some hasty rethinking. If the South Africans could not regularly blunt the front end of a weakened Indian attack in winning both the Test and one-day series just completed, there will be more than a few headaches in the weeks to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a case of not having more than one of the top order firing at once.  Any combination of Andrew Hudson, Gary Kirsten, Adam Bacher, Daryll Cullinan and Jacques Kallis are capable of getting lots of runs on the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But too often it has been left to one of them - and too often for comfort a batsman like McMillan or Lance Klusener lower down the order - to do so.  Cricket is, as Cronje is so fond of saying, a team game. It means everyone has to contribute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are tending to leave too much to our bowlers and placing a huge reliance on the aggression and speed of our fielders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, while on the subject of fielders, Jonty Rhodes must again be strongly in the frame for a Test recall. True, he does not bowl, but anyone who could have come close to that full-blooded cut from Sachin Tendulkar, let alone take what must be the most spectacular catch for several decades, while beginning to find the runs coming again at the same time, deserves careful consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For it is all about runs on the board. Australian captain Taylor has started getting them again after a miserable run with the bat in the Frank Worrall Trophy series against the enigmatic West Indians. He has had none of the barracking of the Aussie crowds or been pilloried in the press and this has surely done much for his peace of mind and confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Waugh's century against Boland this week and the runs gathered in quick time by Matthew Hayden and Matthew Elliot means that the Australians have the nucleus of a batting order that runs deep and strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor is also happy with the pace and bounce of the wickets the tourists have played on thus far, something the Indians never truly came to terms with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It promises to be an interesting series between the old rivals and provide a far better benchmark of this country's position in the overall order of Test cricket than the series against the disarrayed Indians or any artificial rankings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, no matter which side eventually prevails, it will be a tough few weeks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - When viewed from a distance, with his chronically arthritic right knee and a hairline that is receding faster than the tide at Timaru beach, it is possible that he has become shrouded in middle age, that quite suddenly he has been mugged by Methuselah. It is only when one gets much closer, and sees those still youthful, handsome features that one remembers Martin Crowe is still only 34.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowe was at Lancaster Park last week, along with Sir Richard Hadlee, both on day- release from the Pantheon. The greatest batsman and the greatest bowler in New Zealand's history were overseeing preparations for the third Test against England, which New Zealand lost thus losing the series 2-0.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowe was one of the great batsmen of the modern era, with 5 394 runs from 74 Tests, 17 hundreds and an average of 46,10. Massive natural talent was forged with a painstaking technique to make his batting sometimes appear perfect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Wellington, where they lost by an innings and 68 runs, New Zealand's batsmen batted less like rabbits than victims of myxomatosis. So in the very English city of Christchurc (a place known for its weeping willows, please note) it seemed reasonable to ask whether he was frustrated not to be playing at an age when some batsmen are still approaching their peak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he seemed rather relieved it was all over. There are some sportsmen for whom the search for perfection becomes a tortured narcissism; Carl Lewis is one, John McEnroe another. It is a category that also houses Crowe, essentially an unselfish team player who allowed himself to become self-exiled from the dressing room by his search for batting sublimity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a time, about 1987 and 1988, when my intensity and intolerance of other players stopped me enjoying the game. I was playing for Somerset and New Zealand, teams not endowed with a great deal of batting talent. At Somerset there was the additional pressure of coming to the club after they had got rid of Viv Richards and Joel Garner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I drew on all my mental and physical resources to ensure I didn't fail (he scored six centuries in the sonorous Somerset summer of 1987).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you are under that sort of pressure something cracks. My cracks started to appear with my inability to relax with the rest of the team.&quot; It had all felt so different in Crowe's previous season at Taunton, in 1984.  Then he was hero- worshipped by the young players n the staff, even though he was only 21. He was the founder and guru of the Nags Club, where the country's youngsters would meet excitedly to discuss the game, ambition and idealism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowe was brought up in an affluent suburb of Auckland, where he now lives, running his sports consultancy business, Winning Ways, between stints on Sky TV. Even as a boy his confidence earned him the nickname Hogan, after the TV comedy show Hogan's Heroes. He was clearly more gifted than his elder brother Jeff and from an early age he would play Test cricket and wanted to be compared with the likes of Hammond and Richards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By nature an introvert but in lifestyle an extrovert, he did not sit easily among such great New Zealand sporting heroes as John Walker, Colin Meads and Hadlee. At one time his unpopularity with the press reached such a level that there was a claim of homosexuality and another that he was suffering from Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tough times are still here. Last year his marriage collapsed as irrevocably as his right knee. &quot;I took a bit of a hammering in 1996. It was the year my marriage failed and also when I finally decided to pack it in as a player. I gave it my best shot. But I'm busy. I set up and run Cricket Max.&quot; This is a hectic, half- day game consisting of two innings a side, each lasting just 10 overs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Then I have my TV work, my consultancy and my work with the current New Zealand players which I feel is very important. Before the Wellington Test the batsmen looked pretty good with their technique in the nets. They seemed to know how to 'leave' the ball. But they just seemed to panic in those two hours on the first day. They chased everything that was wide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Possibly they felt they would rather be fielding than batting in that tricky period, but their anxiety levels really kicked in. Experience is a big factor. These days we don't have those players showing the new guys how to hang in there. We have aproblem here. We're doing well at youth and development level but cricket in this country has become diluted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lot of touch rugby being played in the summer and the rugby season itself is longer. Soccer is also being played in the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This means that club cricket and the core of the game is not as strong as it was in the 1980s. Also, in the Eighties, we had five members of the New Zealand team playing in England's county championship, Richard and myself, John Wright, Geoff Howarth and Glenn Turner. Now there is only Chris Cairns at Notts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The championship helps develop a player's professionalism. The senior players are not there at the moment. We have a new brand of player who has to get his advice from his coach, or from advisors like Richard and myself.  Stephen Fleming is only 23 and has played just a handful of Tests, with a single hundred, but he is now viewed as our senior batsman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is worth remembering that countries such as New Zealand and Pakistan always struggled to beat England until the likes of Parker, Turner, Hadlee and Crowe, Imran, Zaheer and Sadiq started to play regular county cricket.  Last week Crowe and Hadlee were not on the field but shuffling about, hands in pockets. The world felt a duller place.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In 1963, Ken Tyrrell received a life- changing phone call. &quot; I was running what was then a Formula Junior team, before the name was changed to Formula Three, so I was always looking for likely drivers. The track manager at Goodwood called me up one day and said: 'There's a young Scotsman going round here in an old sports car who's pretty bloody good.' His name was Stewart, and he came down and had a test drive. It was the first time he'd ever driven a single-seater, and he was quite exceptional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The partnership between Jackie Stewart and Ken Tyrrell blossomed into one of the great double acts of Grand Prix racing. When Stewart retired in 1973 he had won three world championships, one in a Matra run by Tyrrell, and two in Tyrrell's own cars, while Tyrrell took the constructors' championship in 1971.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the 1997 Formula One (F1)season roars into life in Melbourne next month, Tyrrell and Stewart will both be there, but for the first time they'll be battling head-to-head as bosses of their respective teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stewart, now 57, has decided the time is right to take the plunge into the rarefied world of state-of-the-art aerodynamics and computer design, a place where you need the backing of a super-rich multi-national coalition merely to get to the starting grid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Stewart has eight years' experience of helping his son to guide Paul Stewart Racing to a dominant position in the British Formula Vauxhall and Formula Three championships, designing, building and racing a new Formula One car is like taking a leap into hyperspace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've had a lot of people saying 'why take the risk of destroying your reputation?'&quot; Stewart reflects, radiating energy and briskness despite the fact that it's dark, foggy and 7.15 in the morning. His chauffeur-driven journey from Sunningdale - where his house straddles the fairway of Wentworth golf course - to his team's factory in Milton Keynes is a rare period of calm in his insane schedule, so he often uses it for interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't see it as a risk at all. I see it as another business. I've done other things and they've been logically and carefully planned and executed. I don't expect automatic success, but we'll work at it like everybody has to work at every new business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, former F1 driver turned TV commentator John Watson says: &quot;This is the most difficult challenge that Jackie Stewart has ever had to face in his entire career, because he can't control every aspect of it, whereas as a driver you can control what you're doing pretty much. Paul Stewart Racing will buy a car from a manufacturer, and if a part doesn't arrive they give the manufacturer a bollocking. But Stewart Grand Prix is the team, the manufacturer and the customer, and that is what makes F1 so much more difficult. You have to make a huge commitment but there's no guarantee of any reward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stewart is as clinically logical in business as he was in the cockpit, and calculated the odds carefully. He knew Paul Stewart Racing gave him a solid platform. He knew his own reputation as a figurehead of the sport and as a roving ambassador for assorted prestigious companies, including Rolex and M&quot; et &amp; Chandon, was a major asset. In particular, his 32-year relationship with Ford as adviser and product-tester has now translated into an exclusive five- year deal whereby the company is supplying Stewart Grand Prix with their new V10 engine, plus a mass of additional technical support. And, having led a charmed life in a lethal sport, maybe Jackie just felt lucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody assumes Formula One is so different today, but it was different at the end of World War II,&quot; he argues. &quot;When Ferrari and Maserati started in the late Forties and early Fifties, everybody said, my God, aren't these sophisticated cars?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then, when the rear-engined Lotus arrived everybody said boy, a big technological leap. When we saw the pre-war Mercedes- Benzes and Auto-Unions, those cars were spaceships, and so are today's. But they were no more spaceships than when I drove a Matra MS80 in 1969 and won the world championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was designed by a nuclear physicist and another man who had never tackled motor racing in his life, a total boffin. It's just evolution and progress, and Grand Prix motor racing has always been the sharp end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So sharp, indeed, that Stewart has survived virtually alone of his generation of drivers. With Jim Clark and Graham Hill, Stewart participated in a decade of British dominance of motor racing from the early Sixties to the early Seventies, and the trio were close friends as well as fierce competitors. But while today's F1 drivers know they will probably emerge from their careers in one piece, Stewart's generation faced odds that a Battle of Britain fighter pilot might have balked at. It was Stewart who single- mindedly began the campaign to improve track and driver safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pall that fell on the motor racing community that weekend in Imola in 1994 when Senna and Ratzenberger died was extraordinary,&quot; he says. &quot;It was because it had been 12 years since a driver had died in a Grand Prix. People had not been exposed to the shock and the grief and the emotional destruction.  In 1968, I saw that every single month for four consecutive months. In many cases, I had to assist in having the body taken back to wherever it had to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's drivers, God be thanked, have not had much experience of that. Nor have they packed the case, as my wife Helen had to do, of people who had died that afternoon, and whose wife somebody had to care for and move out of that hotel room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet he still recalls his racing heyday as a unique and thrilling period. He climbed to the pinnacle of his profession while Carnaby Street swung, and Britain baked in the white heat of Harold Wilson's technological revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stewart retired on the weekend of the last race of 1973, at Watkins Glen.  It would have been his 100th Grand Prix, but when his team-mate Fran ois Cevert was killed in qualifying, he decided enough was enough. He had already clinched that year's championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many drivers, racing is all they can do, but he climbed out of the cockpit and straight into the next phase of his career. A dyslexia sufferer who began his career as a teenager pumping petrol at the family garage in Dumbarton, he found that his racing prowess had made him a global citizen, accepted by politicians, royalty, tycoons and showbiz stars. He was far- sighted enough to exploit his advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stewart has claimed that he will be happy if his team scores one or two points in its first season, but not everyone believes him. &quot;That's like Schumacher saying he doesn't think he can win the championship this year, isn't it?&quot; says Ken Tyrrell. &quot;It's a bit of an exaggeration.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Overconfidence will probably be the biggest threat to South African representatives Orlando Pirates, Jomo Cosmos and Bush Bucks when they launch their African club competition campaigns. Pirates have been paired with Rovers of Lesotho in the Champions League, Cosmos tackle Eleven Men in Flight of Swaziland in the Cup-winners Cup and Bush Bucks face Centre Chiefs of Botswana in the CAF Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Buccanners will be making their third consecutive appearance in the leading event, which they surprisingly won in 1995 with victories over clubs from Swaziland, Nigeria, Gabon, Uganda and Ivory Coast. Last year, Pirates proved too strong for teams from Reunion and Zambia before bowing to Nigerian outfit Shooting Stars in a fiercely-contested quarter-final settled by a penalty shootout.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stars went on to lose the final against Egyptian giants Zamalek following another shootout, which indicates just how little separates the top clubs on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key figure in the Nigerian line-up, utility player Sam Pam, joined Pirates this week to bolster a squad poised to make another strong challenge in a cup carrying prize money for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of staging the 33-year-old competition entirely on a home-and-away knockout basis, only the preliminary, first and second rounds will be played in this manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the eight quarter-finalists emerge in late May following the second round, they will be divided into two groups of four with each club playing its opponents twice, once at home and once away with three points for a win and one for a draw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sides heading the groups qualify for the decider, which is scheduled for two legs, a formula also used in South America to determine the most powerful club on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teams will received an unknown amount for every point won in the mini- league phase and if Pirates can confirm their status as a major continental force by going all the way to the final, they stand to collect about R2- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rovers staged a remarkable preliminary- round recovery to book a place among the last 32, walloping Telecom Wanderers from Malawi 5-1 in Maseru after losing the first leg by a solitary goal. It was a rare success at international level for the tiny mountain kingdom and should serve as a warning to the men in black and white that reputations alone do not win matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pirates must be warm favourites to advance, however, with a team that appears to revel in the cut and thrust of cup football and became champions by defeating ASEC 1-0 before 50 000 fanatical Ivorian supporters. Strength in the face of adversity proved a critical factor in Abidjan and goalkeeper Williams Okpara, defenders Phiri Tsotetsi and Gavin Lane, midfielders John Moeti, Dumisa Ngobe and Brendon Silent and forward Jerry Sikhosana are still there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabonese defender Guy-Roger Nzeng and Pam have added some international flavour to a team now guided by former Peruvian World Cup player and Bafana Bafana coach Augusto Palacios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosmos may be one of the cinderella clubs in the national championship with few big- name players and disappointing support since ending a nomadic existence and moving east to PAM Brink Stadium in Springs. However, opponents could underestimate the Ezenkosi at their peril as the club owned and coached by Jomo Sono made a sensational Cup-winners Cup debut when South Africa first entered the competition four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victories over teams from Swaziland, Madagascar, Burundi and the vastly experienced Daring Club Motema Pembe of Zaire propelled the outsiders into the semi-finals, where they finally met their match. Wealthy and packed with national stars, Africa Sports National came south from the Ivory Coast to Thohoyandou where they recovered from the shock of an early Cosmos goal to force a draw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosmos made a disastrous start to the return match at the same ground where Pirates were to conquer Africa, conceding a couple of early goals and despite the valiant efforts of a then emerging Mark Fish, Africa Sports romped to a four-goal triumph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven Men in Flight will have home advantage first as they attempt to atone for a dismal previous showing against South African opposition in which they crashed 5- 0 to Pirates two years ago. Cosmos may lack household names, but Burundian Aime Kitenge can be an inspirational goalkeeper and central defender Andrew Raputla is worth a place in the national squad, according to former star Sono.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Midfielder Vusi Mncwanga added to a growing reputation by scoring twice at home to Amazulu last weekend and Mozambican Manuel &quot;Tico Tico&quot; Bucuane has been finding the net with increasing frequency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush Bucks from Umtata may be newcomers to continental fare, but technical adviser Marthias Mwenda once coached the Malawi national team and his knowledge should prove precious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading scorer Wilfred Mugeyi and brother William, a defender who has scored more Castle Premiership goals than most forwards, have represented Zimbabwe at competitive level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Centre Chiefs' only previous excursion into Africa ended abruptly four years ago when they lost 6-0 on goal aggregate to Power Dynamos of Zamiba, and while the margin may be closer next month, another early exit seems likely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The resignation of Springbok coach Andre Markgraaff is bound to affect the players, which is good news for South Africa's opponents in the tough season ahead</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS the dust rises in ever thickening clouds to turn whatever hint there was of transparency in South African rugby into an even murkier soup, it is well to study what the implications of the resignation of coach Andre Markgraaff are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man who arrived amid a howl of controversy and left with a tear-stained whimper of self-pity, has done the game in this country a vast disservice. He has lost this country its most successful and popular captain in Francois Pienaar, been instrumental in the resignation of an honourable and respected manager in Morne du Plessis, insisted on selecting hooker Jan Tromp for the national side despite the outrage of the majority of the country's citizens about elevating a man jailed for killing a black teenager to Test status, and been behind some highly questionable squad selections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this, Markgraaff has lost a Sanzar series, given the All Blacks their first series victory on a tour of South Africa, and then come out on top in tours to the Argentine, France and in the single Test against Wales.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of this is a matter of record. So, it would seem, in the light of his hasty, self-imposed exile from the game, is his espousal of the kind of racist thinking which has continued to tarnish South African rugby's image in the post-apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is still the ministerial probe into the inner workings of the game at top level to come and, in the light of South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) president Louis Luyt's cover-up of the tape, this takes on an urgency that overrides any reluctance of Sarfu to become willing participants in this fact-finding mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than at any time in the past, Sports Minister Steve Tshwete's insistence on opening the closed doors of rugby administration assumes added importance. For, at present, the image of transparency in rugby is roughly akin to a sneak kick in the head in the nether regions of a loose scrum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worst of it all though is that it reflects badly on the players, who face a season of Super 12, Currie Cup, the World Cup Sevens in Hong Kong, as well as the tri-nation series against New Zealand and Australia and a tour by the British Lions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Markgraaff's indiscretions and Sarfu's reluctance to deal with them in public has done is make the going for anyone taking over the Springbok coaching reins extremely difficult, and make a job which should be the premier position in this country one that has been severely tainted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole affair is bound to affect the players in some way. Even if it is only from the point of view of the bulk of this country's citizens and their perceptions of a game that was, after all, designed to be played by gentlemen and their sons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if, as Markgraaff continues to contend, the recording by Griqua captain Andre Bester was an attempt at blackmail, why was the whole issue not taken to the courts immediately? Certainly, if these allegations are ever tested before law, it would give rise to a re-examination of all the aspects of contracts between players and unions, and a formalisation and standardisation of the manner in which these are conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, it is well to recall the wrangling which has accompanied James Small - himself a casualty of Markgraaff's ire during last season's Springbok selections - and his desire to settle in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of the contracted players from the victorious 1995 World Cup squad - only Chester Williams opted out of the lucrative cash deal and remained a free agent - Small is paid in part by Sarfu and in part by the union he plays for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It meant that Natal were quite within their rights to hold him to the contract he had with them and demand compensation from Western Province for the services of one of their biggest draw-cards. But there is confusion surrounding the R250 000 cap Sarfu imposed on player transfers and then withdrew in favour of a system of repayment for player movements which has still to be formalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is nothing basically wrong with a transfer fee as a business agreement. But it does tend to leave the players shackled to a province not necessarily of their choice. It also raises the argument of whether a player can really be made to play. Form and fitness are, after all, things that the player himself provides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Cup contracts were hastily signed by Sarfu at a time when professionalism was still a banned entity in world rugby and, indeed, that haste has led to agreements which, while they ushered in payment for players at a level never dreamt of as little as five years ago, must be considered suspect in many respects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief of these is the amount the players were granted on a three-year basis.  It is no revelation that some of the World Cup squad have failed to repay this bounty and are not even considered for their provincial teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the aspect of Pienaar, Joel Stransky and Rudolph Straueli -to name just three - who have opted to give up their Sarfu contracts and head for the real money overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of this must be seen in the light of current players in the Springbok side who were not included in the World Cup largesse, earning less than their squad counterparts who, in some cases, cannot even make the Springbok bench.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is with this legacy of murkiness in thought patterns that pervades from payments to attitudes that South Africa's top players go into another tough season of provincial and international competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The All Blacks and Wallabies must be chuckling into their beer. Fran Cotton, who manages the Lions 23 years after playing in the all-conquering touring side under Willie-John McBride, must be positively delighted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then, though the players will undoubtedly take the brunt of all the controversy and underhand manoeuvring, it was surely time that rugby was cleaned out top to bottom anyway.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Holy hormones! The Preacher's Wife has Whitney Houston renouncing sex in the bid for sainthood. JOHNATHAN ROMNEY is not happy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE are many things to respect Whitney Houston for: Like the fact that her song I Will Always Love You is the number one favourite to be played at funerals; or her glacial composure when being propositioned by Serge Gainsbourg on French TV. But despite The Bodyguard and Waiting To Exhale - and the fact that Screen International has listed her as Hollywood's most powerful female star - it's hard to see her as a movie personality. Perhaps it's because Whitney Houston is a brand name first and foremost - a name that figures in every easy-listening CD collection. She's a brand name, not as in Sony or DreamWorks, but as in Badedas - the relaxant queen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's nothing mythical about Whitney, for all the Metropolis robo-goddess drag she sported in The Bodyguard. Madonna was clearly destined for celluloid, but as a pop star Whitney has always aspired to the cosy approachability of the chat-show queen or fitness-video host. In The Preacher's Wife, she's gone one step further in domestication - here she's seen taking the kids to school, negotiating with the child- minder, making testy breakfast-time banter with her husband. She's become the black American answer to supermum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Preacher's Wife is the Christmas movie that got away, now reaching South Africa like the last of the microwaved turkey. If you're allergic to comfort and joy, be warned: glad tidings are all you'll get from this unapologetic religious feelgood film - Songs of Praise with the best rhythm section Disney money can buy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on the 1947 Cary Grant comedy The Bishop's Wife, Penny Marshall's film has Denzel Washington as a beaming, dapperly raincoated angel sent to bring good cheer to Courtney Vance, the beleaguered black pastor of a black community under threat from mean-spirited property developer Gregory Hines.  Whitney, the preacher's wife, does all she can to whip her man out of the doldrums, mainly by getting her gospel choir to pump up the decibels for Jesus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Vance is unimpressed by Washington's super-smooth gaucheness, and Houston all too impressed; before long she's feeling undomestic urges and singing torch songs at the local nightspot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The image of black America here is so cosy it makes The Cosby Show look like gritty urban reportage. The script pays lip- service to the realities of modern American life - crumbling communities, crime, absent fathers - but they seem like timid borrowings from John Singleton films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Preacher's Wife promotes sexlessness as a cardinal virtue. Houston wears one of those dinky little knitted hats that unfailingly signals a sex- free zone. Even when she's supposedly feeling passionate stirrings in a clinging evening dress, her nightclub song is adulterated with a Hollywood Bowlful of artificial sweetener. The film is a reminder of how Hollywood still can't encompass black sexuality. Even when you have a hot-date billing like Houston and Washington, they can't exchange more than a peck because he's an angel. And she can't be getting up to anything steamy with Vance: he's a preacher, and besides, how could anything untoward take place within holy wedlock?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's no surprise that when she sings along with the children's Nativity play at the end, she stands in as the Virgin Mary. No amount of cleavage- flashing on the cover of Premiere magazine can taint her angelic image now.  The whole film could be seen as a damage-limitation exercise on the part of a star whose own marriage has been tainted by shady rumour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, sugar-coated and mendacious as it is, I have a terrible feeling that there's nothing remotely cynical about this film. Director Penny Marshall was responsible for the rousing team-spirit-and-personal- redemption exercises like A League of Their Own and Awakenings. Only a director with a genuinely pure heart would have countenanced the moment when Washington's handshake is described as &quot;kinda like springtime and Mom's home-cooking rolled into one&quot;.  Only Courtney Vance comes away with any credit here, looking deeply unimpressed - like a man who's about to quit the cloth and hit the bottle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Preacher's Wife will go on circuit nationwide this Friday, February 21</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - HOW many white middle class males in their 50s living in a retirement village - &quot;where no-one buys art&quot; - are painting berry- brown, sherry-brown bodies to inspire a sensual dialogue in post-apartheid South Africa? Well, Terrence Patrick is one. This artist does not simply yearn for reconciliation but for a Versoening (reconciliation), based on sensuality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Patrick reveals black people as beautiful, and as &quot;sensual beings&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He paints black nudes surrounded by pasty- faced males; curious onlookers with black marble eyes. So Monet's Olympia goes black; while an onlooker, a white priest, calmly sips his Earl Grey tea. He watches; she reflects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent painting, The Source, is about such sexuality. Because Patrick feels it's time we reinvented our symbolic mother. So he confronts this issue in a populist way through cartoonish images smacking of Beryl Cooke's rosy- cheeked caricatures, with the men very much Doubting Thomases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick also paints the open palm and uses the symbol of money as he feels that's what's being offered to lure black people into the system. &quot;Money is the peace offering. So we reveal our world of money and we let you into it.  So we have this juggling of values between the psychological framework of Western man against tribal Africa. No wonder we're all so confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Art, for Patrick, is confronting the significance of the new. He wants to reveal different emotional states in one painting - the confusion and the seduction. He admits he doesn't expect to earn money from his current exhibition. &quot;But I'm very fluent at the moment. I've searched inside for many years for what I want to say. It's very rewarding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Die Versoening is on at Pietermaritzburg's Tatham Art Gallery until February 23. It shares the space with works by Reshada Crouse</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Have you heard? DID you hear Radio 702's John Robbie and Dan Moyane on the Markgraaff debacle on Tuesday morning? Compelling radio, it had Springbok rugby coach Andre Markgraaff deeply uncomfortable on the day of his fall from grace. He also kept calling Dan &quot;John&quot;, which Dan charitably interpreted as nerves, noting that the reverse naming confusion has happened in other tense interviews. By Tuesday evening, Markgraaff had announced his resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharp as nails, nicely sceptical and right on the story, Dan and John are great to wake up to.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the rest of the day, the station keeps the pace, with John Berks, Jenny Crwys-Williams, Barry Ronge and Chris Gibbons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the only two gripes one hears about 702 (on shortwave) are that it is a touch hyperactive and it overdoes crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the first, well, yes, it does sometimes sound like a little Valium could be in order. But then it wouldn't be lively and energising, would it? If you like things a bit calmer, there's always SAfm. So there you go - two English, news and issues oriented channels, fine tuned enough to match your mood swings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for crime. Difficult one that. There is, after all, a huge problem in the country, which can be solved by quadrupling the police force and increasing their pay. Then you put them on the beat, on foot, in groups of not less than three, as is done in Paris, where these groups of gendarmes are everywhere. In the meantime, why should 702 stop nagging?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday morning had John Berks tackling rape in the lead-up to the march on the Union Buildings, which turned out a damp squib. Jenny Crwys- Williams reacted in the afternoon by suggesting that 702 put its weight behind a properly organised and publicised march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berks handled the morning with sensitivity, rejecting outright those crazily xenophobic callers who blamed rape on foreigners. Where he hilariously broke down, though, was in announcing a new show, Mail &amp; Guardian literary editor Shaun de Waal's Not All Straight Talking, from 9pm to midnight on Friday. It tackles gay issues, he told us, &quot;so if you're slightly bent ... Oops, now I've asked for it. Now I'm in trouble!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not All Straight Talking has been on air only twice so far. The first show threw open the lines on the question of &quot;do we have the right to exist as a separate programme?&quot; as well as the language issue (moffie/fag/dyke and so on) ; the second on the issue of coming out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the first radio station to have a programme such as this,&quot; says De Waal. &quot;Gay issues usually come up in a 'problem' category, so this is a way of normalising it. I'd like to move away from gay issues eventually and do programmes about whatever, through gay eyes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, we all need a break from serious issues too, and the station certainly provides plenty of that, what with Jenny and Barry's lighthearted afternoon hour, John and Dan's morning banter and an evening programme on sexual problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio 702 has reorganised the Age of Aquarius Saturday night material. Now there's Alternative Talk from 7 to10pm, which discusses things like diet, metaphysics, exercise, meditation, health and so on, while 702 Looks Ahead at 10pm is the pure prediction stuff, using astrology, tarot cards, psychics, whatever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weekday evening programmes include Jon Qwelane's show on Monday night, great for its high-profile guests and challenging perspectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the public accusing the judicial system of protecting criminals, he had to again make the point that, in fact, it protects the accused and that everyone is innocent until proved guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also legal and medical advice shows at night. On weekends, it's pets, property, gardening and spiritual issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you can spend your weekends working on your garden, spending quality time with your pets and/or children, and pondering the meaning of it all on Sunday night, I'd say life is probably just as it should be.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - SWAPNA PRABHAKARAN saw the Bolshoi Ballet in action, and was not overawed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT was only to be expected that the rich and famous would swoop down onto the Civic Theatre to attend the premiere of the Bolshoi Ballet. And they were there early, decked out in their finery and guzzling gin and tonics before the doors opened. Most seemed to be hardened veterans of dance- watching, chatting amicably about this or the other ballet they had seen, and the upcoming Dance Umbrella.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With tickets costing a lot, it was small wonder that only the very glittering of glitterati could afford to be there. Before the curtain rose, Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo emerged from backstage, beaming at the audience. He said he was sure we would all enjoy the performance, and he believed it would &quot;undoubtedly inspire a lot of our youth out on to the stage&quot; , which was ironic, considering precious few of the people there could be labelled youthful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I welcome you and you will have the opportunity to judge the ballet for yourself,&quot; Nzo concluded before handing the microphone to a tall Russian man, who may have been the artistic director of the ballet, Vyatcheslav Gordeyev.  He announced that this was the first Bolshoi performance ever in Africa. &quot;And it is here in the new democratic South Africa they will perform, for all the countries in Africa.&quot; But around me all I heard was English and Afrikaans.  There wasn't a dark face in the audience that I could see, apart from the minister, and mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon the over-familiar strains of Act II of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake seeped out of the sound system, adding to a strange sensation of watching a simulacrum or a giant televised replay of the actual dance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps this was because for the first few minutes all the dancers were just a few notes off-time with the music, giving their precision footing and dynamic grace a stilted and under-rehearsed feeling. The first natural musical pause happened and the dancers halted for a second, visibly disconcerted when no one applauded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then everything fell into place, almost by mutual agreement. The dancers settled into the performance and the audience suspended their disbelief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After interval the enthusiastic academy graduates took the stage and their exuberance was infectious. These dancers were less experienced than the professionals of the first half, but decidedly more entertaining. Gentle dying swans had been replaced by high-kicking, wild and colourful adaptations of Eastern European folk dances, and the tannies in the front row were clapping along with the music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most popular item of the night was the rather sensual pas de deux - billed as &quot;brilliant and pure technical bravura&quot; in the programme notes. These two got no less than six curtain calls by the end of the evening, when everyone rose to give the honorary standing ovation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long applause followed, with little girls carrying bouquets of flowers to the ballerinas and director, Sofia Golovkina. It was all lovely to look at, but not really a gesture of shared artistry between the two countries. Sadly, it was somewhat under-representative, hollow and insubstantial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bolshoi Ballet will be performing at the Nico Malan Opera House in Cape Town from February 25 to 28</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - OPERA has long had the unfortunate stigma of being perceived as an inaccessible European holy cow. True, some of its origins can be traced back to the late 16th century in Italy, to a group of learned poets and musicians known as the Florentine Camerata, but it has come a long way since then. In the course of history it has shrugged off the &quot;Italian&quot; label, as Richard Wagner demonstrated with his Music Dramas, or more recently Karlheinz Stockhausen with his Licht Music Ceremonies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The formality and strict demarcation of artistic genres in traditional European art forms such as dance, singing, playing an instrument and acting, do not exist in Africa. Some ethnomusicologists might be up in arms about this, but take a Xhosa example such as ukombhela, a delicate yet sombre singing style in the lower register usually performed by a group of middle- aged women. It is accompanied by subtle dance movements and slow clapping, often in a totally different metre from the singing. This might seem like a postcard from the local curio shop, but that is the way things are in villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their song the women would usually sing of some historical tragedy. They would be in costume and adorned in beads that signify their status in the community and have their faces painted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what most Africans find appealing about opera. Disregarding the formalities of recitative and da cap arias, it stands as the only European art form that comes close to this African model of music-making - a synthesis of various art forms with singing as the unifier. Scholars in African music point out that not only is singing predominant in African music in general, but that south of the Limpopo there is a marked scarcity of instrumental music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a BBC radio interview two years ago, Dr Andrew Tracey, director of the International Library of African Music in Grahamstown and a world authority on the subject, even went a step further and said that the bass drum was introduced into Zulu music by the British Army towards the end of the previous century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A talented contingent of black local opera singers, among them the versatile diva Sibongile Khumalo, Linda Bukhosini, Bongani Thembe, Raphael Vilikazi, Abel Motsoadi and Sibongile Mngoma, have established themselves as competent artists in a medium that at surface level seems foreign and far removed from the dusty streets of the townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Cape-based opera singer, whose pupils are a success in major European opera houses, attributes the success of most of these singers to what he calls an &quot;incredible sonority&quot; in the voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is quick to point out, however, that the voice is only an instrument and is not the only make-up of a singer. Composers like Richard Strauss demand a great deal of musicality from their singers, so singers need to have a firm musical background which, unfortunately, cannot be acquired at 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is why he believes music education is important in the child's formative years at school; a necessary foundation for future growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a process that is long overdue, hampered by the nature of politics in the country and the short-sightedness of cultural purism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The road ahead doesn't look an easier one either, but Africans are sure to make their mark in opera, and celebrate together with the rest of the world in the common language of the human race - music.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - GLYNIS O'HARA speaks to the versatile Sibongile Mngoma, a young soprano who is riding the wave of opera in South Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUPERLATIVES fly for Sibongile Mngoma (25), the soprano whose voice has overwhelmed critics, conductors and the public. &quot;I think she's great,&quot; says Robert Maxym, freelance American conductor and musician resident in South Africa. &quot;She's young, talented, enthusiastic, dramatic and has tremendous possibilities. I wish I'd had sopranos like her in the hundreds of performances I conducted in Europe, but I didn't.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think she's perhaps the most exciting female voice since her aunt, Sibongile Khumalo, came on the scene,&quot; says Paul Boekkooi, classical music writer for The Star. &quot;There are some women who are really good in certain roles, but this voice is versatile. She can sing anything well, from German lieder to gospel to Gershwin. So often, attempts to cross over from classical to popular are unsuccessful, but she can do it. She's a very big new talent.  If she can do what she's doing at 25, she'll be amazing at 40.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Cock, conductor of the beleaguered National Symphony Orchestra adds: &quot;She's one of the biggest talents around. Every time I hear her she improves.  She's got real potential. She also has a sense of presence on the stage and is very sussed about business arrangements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she hears praise like this, she laughs and responds: &quot;This is unreal.  I'm still waiting for someone to pinch me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibongile has already performed in Opera Afrika's Carmen in Durban, in Enoch Prophet of God, Porgy and Bess and sung on the soon-to-be-released recording of uShaka, among other projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her next performance will be on March 16, a recital at Des and Dawn Lindberg's soir'e in Houghton. Then, on March 18, she opens in an Andre Lloyd- Webber show at the Civic, with Juanita Kruger and AJ van der Merwe, plus a chorus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 25, Sibongile is doing a Sunday morning recital for Pact, covering everything from spirituals to songs from the musicals to arias from La Boh me and Carmen. She's so busy though, that when I speak of this concert she admits she had completely forgotten it and takes down the details for her diary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She works full-time in education, as the cultural officer at Wits Technikon, based on a campus near SABC headquarters, as she feels &quot;you need to help out in whatever way you can. The people in this country need the education badly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, on top of juggling her fast-rising, increasingly demanding singing career. And she's a single mother of an almost-two toddler. No wonder she sounds exhausted whenever you get through on the phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God I'm tired. My brain's not functioning,&quot; is virtually all she says on meeting you. A slip of a girl at five foot, she's dressed in a floor-length navy blue floral printed dress, wearing gold earrings and is the epitome of casual elegance, however over-extended she is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More and more black classical talent is emerging in South Africa, often from one of two family axes. One revolves around Professor Xhabi Mngoma's family - Sibongile Mngoma's grandfather and Sibongile Khumalo's father - former head of the music department of the University of Zululand. The other revolves around violinist Michael Masote, who runs a school in Soweto and who trained relatives and friends in the Soweto String Quartet and countless others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two groups idea is true to a certain extent,&quot; says Sibongile, &quot; although we have overlapped as well, for example in the Soweto Symphony Orchestra ... But I think those two hubs of activity have just been exposed more, there have been other efforts ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Classical music is absolutely spreading in the townships. It's a pity that just at this point, the government is critical of its funding. There's no justification for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was ironic, she said, that threats to the National Symphony Orchestra and the arts councils were coming just as so many people who were not Eurocentric were getting interested in classical music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also, the NSO used to use the Linder and the City Hall. Now they're involved in community projects like the massed choir festival, and they play in Soweto regularly. To take it away now makes no sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd argue for solid funding of classical music, it seems crazy to lose the opera department at Pact. Jo'burg doesn't even have opera or ballet. Why not, when there's so much interest? The closing down of opera schools, like in Pretoria, is not on. At Wits there's pressure too and it's unnecessary ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mngoma trained at the University of Cape Town's opera school with Sarita Stern, who's still her teacher - &quot;we fly up and down for training&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like her aunt, she also sings jazz, even though she was initially told at the opera school that she had to choose between the two forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But fate took over and I had to go and sing at the Dock Road venue to fill in for someone, so I did both. It was with the consent of teachers: you had to get permission to do anything commercial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a winner of the Standard Bank Young Artist's award, she gets to perform on the Main Festival in July this year. &quot;We're looking at a concert of across- the-board material. We'll be using a string quartet with piano and jazz- band- type percussion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing her voice as heavy lyric, she says her favourite roles now are Micaela in Carmen and Mimi in La Boh me. &quot;But I'd like to do everything, although I can't yet because I'm too young. I'm in an odd position - I'm too old for teenage parts and too young for some of the roles I want!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't do Madame Butterfly yet. It's a very heavy role, requiring a mature sound and a mature body as well. I'm not yet at a level where I can attack the heavy stuff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I couldn't do Norma either. Possibly in another five years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wouldn't it be wonderful to have a South African opera star on the international stage, rivalling great memories like Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland, and simultaneously bringing tears to the eyes of onse Mimi and arts supporter Deputy President Thabo Mbeki? Of course it would.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But let's not frighten Sibongile with too much expectation. Let's just revel in what we have now, which is fabulous.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - IF you're one of the millions of South Africans who tunes in to any of an ever- growing number of music radio stations each day, it's unlikely that many of the sexy, soothing, lively or witty DJ voices you hear belong to a woman. Or when you get down in the club of your choice, check out the DJ booth: it's equally unlikely the DJ is a sister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you do hear a woman presenter on air she's most likely the newsreader.  Some people, like Radio Metro producer Christina Scott, feel women are pressed into news and then not easily deployed elsewhere.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metro and 5fm, two of the country's most popular radio stations, are hardly leading the way when it comes to empowering (read employing) women as DJs.  5fm's Michelle Constant, like every other female DJ the Mail &amp; Guardian approached, certainly doesn't think there are enough women DJs. 5fm has three: Constant, Cleone Cassidy and Ursula Stapelveldt. But they all have only weekend slots. Metro has only one woman DJ, Ethel Malindi, and she's on at the weekend between midnight and 3am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Naughton, who works in community radio, says that the scarcity of women's voices in commercial and public broadcasting means that women's issues are not adequately dealt with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community radio fares better than commercial radio, though it still has a long way to go. The Voice of Soweto Community Station has nine men and seven women presenters, as well as a female station manager and sports editor - though this is unusual. Voice of Soweto also gets more applications from women for DJ jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, 5fm station manager Anthony Duke says the ratio of audition tapes the station gets is around 50:1 male to female. Research commissioned by 5fm shows most respondents felt the typical DJ was male. Some felt the male voice transmits better than &quot;the high pitched female voice&quot; - research, he says, that does not guide the station's selection criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do believe they're still holding the women back,&quot; says Constant. There is no reason Cassidy - who plays mainstream music - should not have an afternoon slot during the week. Constant believes station managers are not &quot; 100% behind putting women in primary radio slots&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott's view is that the lack of women presenters has become a blind spot: &quot; People in power tend not to push very hard - they're sensitive about racial issues but not about sexual issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio Metro station manager Zolisile Mapipa says it's important that radio becomes more representative, but that his station has only one female DJ because &quot;they're very hard to come by&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe it,&quot; Scott says. She notes that when Lawrence Dube was on leave the standard procedure was to replace him with a man instead of a woman, though the male replacements were often below par. &quot;There are lots of capable women out there ... and within the station.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shado Twala, an extremely popular DJ at Metro and 702 between 1986 and 1993, is now part of a consortium trying to get a licence for Jazz FM. She calls the claims of a lack of capable women &quot;bullshit&quot; and questions why, if this is indeed the case, women aren't being nurtured and trained. She says she has seen men rise to high positions women could have filled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That broadcasting has always been male- dominated was mentioned by many of those interviewed. The opening of the airwaves in 1995 and the advent of community stations has begun to open up a few spaces for women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unusually for a community, public or commercial broadcaster, Voice of Soweto's station manager is a woman - Nkuli Kgotsisile. Male chief executive Mpumi Dakile acknowledges that Voice of Soweto has &quot;a higher intake of women than any other station because &quot;we took a decision to employ capable - not token - women&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frances Green, a trainer at the Community Radio Training Project, addresses issues of ownership and control when she says it is &quot;highly unusual to find women on station management committees&quot;, which results in more men getting jobs and being sent on training courses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stereotype of women being incapable also plagues DJs. Most of those the M&amp;G spoke to said women had constantly to prove they were as good as their male counterparts. And they are also subject to the other sins of a sexist society - like on-air sexist jokes, and that Cassidy was stalked at one stage.  Twala says of her one-time late-night slots that &quot;people would see me as a sex object and want to talk dirty&quot;. And what about the rumours of a station manager being fired for &quot;casting couch&quot; tactics?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stereotypes also affect programming - Twala says women are often relegated to mid- morning slots dealing with children's issues and the like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some other ways forward. Twala thinks women need to continue working their way up. Nothing will change until those in the stations and public register their discontent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mapipa was right when he said: &quot;It will only be when we deliver that people will know we're serious about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'THERE are women pilots and women lawyers, so why no women DJs?&quot; asks one of South Africa's biggest male DJs on the kwaito scene, Oscar Warona. He's never met a woman DJ, and thinks women either don't have the confidence or the commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it isn't only the kwaito scene that lacks women DJs. Vicki Edwards, a British garage/house DJ who plays at Krypton and Decadance, says she has been shocked by how few female club DJs there are in South Africa. In the 12 years she's been in the field, she says, the number of women club DJs in the United Kingdom has grown so much that their presence has become commonplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicky Blumenfeld is a DJ at Tandoor, and plays a range of acid jazz , funk, R&amp;B and Soul African and Latin American music. She started club DJing five years ago, and says she's never had problems from fellow DJs but has had problems with men in the audience who &quot;aren't used to the idea of women at the controls&quot;. She has noticed a slight increase over the last year in women DJs playing hip-hop and kwaito.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But do women DJs bring anything new to club DJing? Blumenfeld says the Valentine's Day session at Tandoor, where there were four women DJs, was an example of &quot;wonderful, gentle energy, so the place can be packed, but not the same level of aggression&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both have found that some do not take them seriously. Edwards told of a rave where the organisers set up a &quot;women's room&quot; - &quot;It was all just a gimmick, a tiny room, crappy sound equipment.&quot; Many people still assume women can't deal with technology - or that &quot;you're sleeping with the promoter&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The obvious angle from which one could approach this review would be to focus on the fact that this was Prophets of da City's first live performance (at the Best Bay Educare Centre in Lentegeur, Mitchell's Plain, Cape Town) since their return to South Africa. The venue that the Prophets chose would not have been the choice of the average performer who, by assumption, would like to promote him/herself as well as make a buck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These observations are linked because, as it turned out, the concert was not actually about the Prophets, but about the community from which they came.  Similarly, this article is not actually about Prophets of da City. It's really about reciprocity in hip-hop subculture, and its commitment to upliftment, aspects that have been overlooked in the wake of gangsta rap.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rhyme Unit Feed The Needy Organisation (RUFTNO), chaired by singer/composer Deen Louw, achieved more than merely raising funds for their cause. They managed to create a nurturing performance space for children and young adults. The Prophets recently joined RUFTNO, which started as a feeding scheme in 1991 and only accepted donations in kind, in order to ensure that hip-hop's commitment to black upliftment moves far beyond the stage or record sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concert itself seems to have been geared toward encouraging as many children as possible to celebrate at any level. Teeny boppers participated in a modelling competition, and in dancing and singing, as well as rap acts.  Among these acts young rappers Four Feet Deep, consisting of two girls and three boys, were unbelievably schmoove. The older rappers included the highly performative and charming Devious, the socially conscious shy guy Q-Rock and the duo Doogie with their innovative call and response set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What held these rappers and singers such as Penny and Salome Damonse back somewhat was not, importantly, their lack of professionalism, but the technology available. Unlike the more established performers such as the Prophets or Deen Louw, these performers used audio cassettes of varying quality as backing tracks. Getting the sound just right was often a problem for the engineer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ready D of POC came in handy here as he was the DJ for the Azanian B-boyz's dance act and is currently mentoring the Brasse vannie Kaap's DJ. The Azanian B-Boyz were also helped along by POC's Ramone, and Ready D works closely with the Brasse. Ready D also provided a demonstration that had the crowd storming the turntables in nanoseconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it turns out, Brasse Vannie Kaap, Deen Louw, Skeem, Ishmael, Four Feet Deep and the Azanian B-Boys are all under the management of Lance Stehr, winner of the Midem Best Video Award for POC's Understand Where I'm Coming From. According to Deen Louw, they will release albums under the Polygram label. The first album to be released is POC's Ghetto Code. All these performers are therefore receiving the benefit of POC's success overseas as well as their professional expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concert turned out to be quite flexible as performers who were not on the programme were encouraged to take centre stage as well. This is the sort of spirit that pervaded the whole concert. The Brasse Vannie Kaap came in with their combination of feelgood and hard-core rhymes. Once their rof en onbeskof (rough and impolite) Afrikaans set had everyone in the mood for much more, POC's professional and highly entertaining set had everyone up on their feet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Call her a big fish voraciously feeding off South Africa's art plankton. Call her a prophetess and profiteer in one. Call her a superbitch and nurturing matriarch in the same breath. Call her, even, the Mother Teresa of the cultural church. In fact call her virtually anything at all. Just don't call Linda Givon the high priestess of South African contemporary art.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a really horrible description of me and totally untrue,&quot; says the woman who for 30 years has been regarded as the biggest fish in the glass bowl commonly known as the South African art gallery circuit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even though it likens her to a cultish power monger and brings to mind comparisons with her American counterpart, Mary Boone, who in the 1980s was the undisputed queen of New York's Soho art scene, the epithet is not entirely inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, from relatively modest beginnings &quot;in a tiny black corner&quot; Givon went on to represent the brightest stars in the local art firmament. She closed her gallery doors temporarily last year - at a time when the face of local visual arts was looking decidely downcast - partly because she felt it was &quot;morally reprehensible for galleries to hold exhibitions and force artists into debt without the guarantee of selling their work to a depressed market&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now she has returned to relaunch her new gallery (the lease expired on the old one) in a suitably cavernous and stylishly industrial space in the suburbs, with exposed roof rafters and flexible partitions designed in the equally suitable minimalist Soho-style. And - given the huge overheads she must be carrying and the arbitrary returns of her products - she clearly isn't in this for the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm fortunate in that I've never had to depend on the gallery for my economic survival,&quot; she says. &quot;But I just can't see myself retiring quietly.  Mind you, I've learnt to be less of a Leo and more of a lamb. I'm too old to be a trendsetter, but I'm still open enough to anything new. Relaunching the Goodman is a challenge to my intellect, a wonderful opportunity to choreograph a new presentation of art and a new perception of South African art - not in terms of its national status but its international status.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She adds: &quot;In this country there is such a penile assertiveness and a fixation on physical prowess at the expense of the spiritual. Our macho sports heroes who make it internationally are treated like gods, but I've yet to see President Mandela publicly acknowledge the artists who achieve this status. Art is the bloodstream of a nation. If you cut off its supply the country goes gangrenous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one fell swoop Goodman has manifested the dual personae that have helped sustain her reign: the cannily expedient businesswoman who can read the signs of the times in much the same way that namesake Linda Goodman, the astrologist, studies sun signs; and the genuine art altruist, passionately promoting the work of artists in whom she believes, irrespective of fashion or financial risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pick of her crop are on display in Lift Off, the Goodman's inaugural show. It is an impressive and unashamedly aesthetic exhibition by artists of undisputed maturity. It also offers more a consolidation of past concerns than a portent of future directions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of particular note are works by Penny Siopis and Kendell Geers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former's Reconnaissance: 1900 to 1997 is an installation consisting of bits and pieces of personal and public history, tender memories and painful inner conflicts. In many respects it is a quieter, 3-D version of Melancholia - Siopis's painterly masterpiece produced in the mid-1980s which is now owned by Johannesburg Art Gallery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the wall facing the installation are a series of &quot;still lifes&quot;, also harking back to Siopis's earlier output, with their skin-like strokes depicting fragmented religious relics. Siopis has rendered them as fetish objects of nostalgia, desire and abuse in a poignant treatise on excess and abjection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geers's installation offers a more clinical study on the vagaries of political, cultural, social and personal classification. Divided into three components, it consists of anonymous multi- racial mug shots, photostatted and enlarged, with the words &quot;murderer/rapist/terrorist&quot; branded on the foreheads of each face. Hanging on the opposite wall appears to be a series of abstract works that, on closer examination, are finger- and handprints - de- invidualised, decontextualised and also anonymous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next to these is a print by Picasso displayed wrong-side-up. It was owned by Givon's mother, whose surname - Finger - has provided Geers with an ingenious pun (Finger Print). The glass surface of the work has been &quot;dusted for prints&quot; that leave smudge marks on the otherwise pristine surface. This work raises questions relating to issues of authorship, the mark of the artist, and the signs of identification, stigma and stereotypes that dominate and determine our lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking at the Goodman Gallery as a sign of the times, it is clear that while its glow has mellowed, its sun has far from set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lift Off is on at the Goodman Gallery until Saturday February 22</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Gallo Africa Limited is talking to Tusk Records about a takeover. A buyout of Tusk would give Gallo the largest share of the music market in South Africa, says Johnathan Park of the Association of the South African Music Industry (Asami). &quot;But we're talking 0,5 to 2% here - not a huge lead, but a lead nevertheless. It would probably sustain it for the next 12 months.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Oldfield, managing director of Tusk, and Alan Cherry, managing director at Gallo, have confirmed that the two companies are in negotiations, but say nothing is signed yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gallo is no longer a major player,&quot; says Parks. &quot;Its market share has dropped to single figures since it lost the international Sony label. That's why it's interested in Tusk, which is doing extremely well.&quot; The South African market is currently dominated by Polygram, Sony, Tusk and EMI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are having discussions with Gallo,&quot; says Oldfield, &quot;but the rumours are out of control as nothing has yet been signed. I hope we will reach an agreement soon. It's an attractive target for investors because it's the last local company representing a major international label, Warner Brothers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Warner Brothers label has such artists as Madonna, Phil Collins and Simply Red. It is, says an observer, &quot;a fantastic catalogue, and that's the major attraction for Gallo&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gallo, which used to own the licence to press and distribute Sony (which has Michael Jackson and others), lost the label as companies started coming back into the country and setting up their own outfits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sony built new offices on Jan Smuts Avenue and started up its own local recording division with some former Gallo staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The buyout might mean that Tusk's publishing arm would be swallowed up by Gallo publishing,&quot; said the observer. Also, Gallo is part of the CNA group and has a finger in the pie of most major retailers and owns a portion of CDT, the factory manufacturing CDs. So it could help jack up Tusk's distribution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Controversial film-maker Larry Clark is coming to SA to promote his film, Kids, reports CHARL BLIGNAUT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'DAD, I've never seen anything like that before.&quot; So said photographer and film- maker Larry Clark's 12-year-old son after watching the premiere of his photographer father's debut movie Kids. Hardly surprising, considering Kids is one of the most original and contentious movies of the Nineties - dealing as it does with adolescent sex, HIV, drugs and random violence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telling the tale of a gang of New York skateboarders, the movie follows the sexual exploits of an HIV-positive teenage boy as he fulfils his mission to deflower virgins. Most critics have hailed it as an elegiac masterpiece that faces teenage realities while others have dissed it as a sordid, unwholesome tale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Kids, originally banned in South Africa and only unbanned on appeal with a no- under-16 age restriction, is about to open here. And Clark will arrive in Johannesburg this Saturday for the premiere on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking over the phone this week from New York, he says he is excited about coming to Africa for the first time. He intends staying for a week, also visiting Cape Town and Durban. And he's bringing his son, who has never been out of the States, with him. His son was, in some ways, a catalyst for the film. Clark started skateboarding with him and got to know the group of kids he was to base the movie on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he met cult director Gus van Sant (My Own Private Idaho, Drugstore Cowboy, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues) at a California exhibition of his controversial sex and drugs photographs, Van Sant told Clark that he was an admirer of his work. Clark expressed his interest in making a film and Van Sant offered to produce it. Kids premiered at the Sundance Festival in 1995 and was bought for South African distribution by Anant Singh's Videovision in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been all over the world with the film,&quot; said Clark this week, &quot;but I hadn't planned on travelling with it any more.&quot; But he jumped at the opportunity to see a country he's always been interested in; to spend some valuable time with his son and go on safari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He regards the South African banning as &quot;kinda funny that they banned a good film&quot;. In response to the movie being used in other countries as an educational piece for teenagers, he says he didn't set out to make a &quot;message&quot; movie, but rather a &quot;set of images&quot;. Still, he identifies a moral core in the film and feels it is useful to confront people with the realities of growing up in the Nineties. Lobbied for by various anti-censorship groups and the Society for Family Health, Kids has become a cause c'l bre in South Africa and is expected to engender much debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kids opens on circuit in South Africa on Friday February 28</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Been round the world and back and still haven't found what you were looking for? Either you're caught up in a U2 song, or you've been trying to use search engines on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final part of our series on finding information on the Internet, we revisit some of the Web-wide search engines we have looked at in the past, and highlight the new arrivals that are attempting to improve on the old- timers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now, we know that Alta Vista (http://www.altavista.digital.com) may be the most powerful search engine on the Web, but also that it is one of the most blunt. Since we last examined it (Web Feet, May 3 1996), it has acquired a new function, namely LiveTopics, which allows you to narrow down search parameters considerably. Even here, though, you may find that you spend more time honing your search than actually searching.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big new kid on the block since we last tackled this topic is HotBot (http://www.hotbot.com), the search engine created by Wired magazine and Inktomi. Its one major plus over Alta Vista, where your results are displayed 10 at a time, is the choice of displaying results 10, 25, 50, 75 or 100 at a time, so you don't spend more time clicking through search screens than you do to get to the useful search results. It allows you to limit your search via a drop-down menu, but the options are hardly helpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excite (http://www.excite.com/) has revamped its commercial offerings dramatically during the past year by offering Web sites the ability to use an Excite search engine for users to explore just those specific sites. Excite has gone a step further, however, with the launch of a news searching service called Newstracker (http://nt.excite.com), which searches the archives of more than 300 online publications. The drawback is that some search results emerge from the occasional subscriber-only newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flaw in all of this remains the fact that search engines are designed only to find pages that are already linked to pages that are already linked to ... you get the drift?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To quote a new service on the Web: &quot;The vast majority of information available in digital form does not reside directly on the World Wide Web. It is found in hidden databases that cannot be seen or searched by other Internet search engines ... This universe of databases is called the Invisible Web.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome, then, to AT1, Your Guide to the Invisible Web (http://www.at1.com/) . Besides reaching the databases the other engines can't find, AT1 is the first of the search engines to offer a search agent - a technology of the future that, in this case, enables you to assign &quot;agents&quot; to monitor news group (Usenet discussion forums) postings for key words or phrases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - BROADCAST RESOURCES (BR), the network programming services arm of Primedia Broadcasting, is reassessing its role in the market with rumours persisting that the network may even shut shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resources managing director Chris Gibbons this week said the network is &quot; reconfigurating&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BR is operating at a loss and the market it was planning to cater for, when it was established in late 1994, is &quot;not developing the way we anticipated&quot;, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbons refused to put a price tag on how much money has been pumped into the operation, but said &quot;several millions of rands&quot; has been ploughed into the network during the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the network is still making a loss having lost its only two commercial radio clients: Highveld Stereo and Radio KFM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highveld terminated BR's services shortly after its sale to Africa on Air was finalised. Primedia owns 40% of Highveld Stereo via the Africa on Air consortium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Highveld Stereo felt we offered too much national and international news and were not meeting their needs,&quot; Gibbons says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds that the current broadcasting market does not favour networks such as BR because the emerging commercial radio stations are eager to devise unique news formats without any outside network influences. The trend among radio stations, says Gibbons, is to focus on local news which is forcing BR to revisit its product mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After ditching BR, Highveld Stereo began using the services of BR's rival - Network Radio Services (NRS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owned by Sapa, NRS was formed in 1995 and has successfully made an inroad into an otherwise impenetrable market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NRS chief executive James Lorimer argues that there is a place in the market for networks, but admits that the market is &quot;tough&quot; and &quot;constantly changing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbons argues that the developing broadcasting market is causing &quot;some concern&quot; for BR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No finality can be reached until the Independent Broadcasting Authority has issued its final number of radio licences, but we feel that at this stage a degree of caution is required,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Gibbons is confident that the market will use syndicated network material in one or other format, the industry was not yet ready for network feeds. &quot;Abroad you will find that most radio stations use networks late at night to take the heat off their resources,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BR provides news and sports to about 30 community radio stations, while NRS has 44 community radio stations to which it feeds bulletins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of the tailored package varies, with BR and NRS charging about R150 000 per annum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Die Burger and Beeld appear to have shifted their support away from the NP, reflecting a wider rift in the Afrikaner community. Gustav Thiel and Jacquie Golding-Duffy report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT has long been a truism that no National Party leader has survived an attack by Die Burger. As the editorial onslaught against former president and NP leader FW de Klerk continues, it remains to be seen whether the principle holds true</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the attacks on De Klerk by the Afrikaans language press expose the worsening broedertwis (fight among brothers) in the party and increasing divisions among party supporters, they are also highlighting the widening gulf between the two mainstream Afrikaans language dailies themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though their editors deny it, Die Burger and Beeld, both Nasionale Pers (Naspers) newspapers, are growing apart, following their readers as they retreat into two camps: the more conservative old guard NP and the new, more liberal NP.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither paper lends the NP the kind of support the party enjoyed in the past, to some extent a reflection of readers' growing disillusionment with the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Die Burger editor Ebbe Dommisse this week conceded that his paper was once the &quot;official mouthpiece of the party in the Cape Province&quot;. With its stalwart support of Afrikaner nationalism, the newspaper enjoyed a close relationship with the NP from the early days when former editor DF Malan, who became prime minister in 1948, nurtured the bond between the newspaper and NP politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practice is no longer condoned, says Dommisse, adding that neither Die Burger nor Beeld officially support any party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will, however, support certain principles of various parties from time to time and will judge this according to the merit of each case. We are independent newspapers and thus owe no allegiance to any political party,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dommisse's view is echoed by Naspers's executive chair Ton Vosloo, who has been quoted as saying that the newspaper group has adopted a &quot;value approach&quot; towards party politics, and that Afrikaans newspapers have learnt that being too close to a political organisation was no longer &quot;expedient&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editorial staff members, however, are regularly reminded in internal correspondence that &quot;Die Burger should do everything in its power to prevent the African National Congress from making South Africa a one party state&quot; - an admonishment that springs not from loyalty to the NP but a general fear of what the future may bring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mainstream Afrikaans language newspapers have been shying away from the NP for a while now with some moving to the right of the party and others to the left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sunday paper Rapport (owned by Perskor and Naspers) has always been seen as the most conservative of the three Afrikaans mainstream broadsheets, Beeld as by far the most liberal. Die Burger is somewhere between the two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harald Pakendorf, former editor of the now-defunct Die Vaderland, says that while Die Burger has always been closely aligned to the NP, it &quot;has of late become less vociferously NP&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakendorf says it is clear that Die Burger is shifting away from being an NP mouthpiece, reflecting the loss of faith by its NP-supporting Afrikaner readers. But &quot;despite its move away from the NP, it continues to fight the ANC,&quot; Pakendorf says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beeld editor Johan de Wet denied that Beeld and Die Burger are divided about continued support of De Klerk as leader of the NP. The most recent debate about the future of De Klerk started after a speech he made in London at a conference of Andersen Consulting about &quot;the management of change&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Die Burger published the complete speech on February 5 and said it contained an explanation by De Klerk about how he &quot;relinquished power in South Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Die Burger editor Dommisse's editorial read: &quot;The speech was upsetting, to put it mildly, possibly more so for the followers than for the leader who seemed pained by it ... If De Klerk had delivered the speech, where he acknowledges relinquishing the Afrikaners' right to sovereignty, at the time of the negotiations, it should be doubted whether he would have received a mandate to continue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In apparent response, Beeld published the following: &quot;Plans to continue white supremacy at Kempton Park could not succeed ... Beeld believes the time is ripe for Afrikaners to change gear and to move forward into the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper also said political power was something of the past for the Afrikaner, but that this did not mean the Afrikaner people should feel like strangers in their own country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although both papers deny it on the record, sources in both newsrooms believe Beeld's hoofredaksie (editorial management) supports De Klerk's continued leadership; while Die Burger favours Western Cape NP leader Hernus Kriel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, sources claim that this could lead to a major rift in Naspers ranks, although Dommisse remains adamant that mutual respect for editorial integrity between the papers would preclude any rift.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Egoli has become a hit with Afrikaans-speaking viewers - it features high on the &quot;Top Twenty&quot; list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in comparison with March last year, shortly after the relaunch of the SABC, when Egoli was 16th on the &quot;Top Twenty&quot; list. This indicates a heavier patronage of M-Net than previously.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egoli, in fact, achieves higher ratings than the Afrikaans news. However, audience ratings for Egoli in the Afrikaans market have dropped. In 1995, Egoli achieved 15,4 ratings, this is now down to q12 ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the ratings for individual shows are down, advertisers have to start dealing with smaller currencies created by fragmentation. Previously there was only one main channel which delivered to Afrikaans audiences, namely TV1, and to a lesser extent CCV. One could then expect to achieve ratings of 20 for Frasier, 19 for the Afrikaans news or even 18,3 for Win &amp; Spin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the available SABC audience is now being split across three channels providing delivery of 9,6 for Frasier, 11,5 for the news in Afrikaans and 9,6 for Win &amp; Spin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is that the market can now choose. The available audience may be spread across three channels, but the total available audience has not decreased that much over the last couple of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the number of hours audiences spend in front of television seems to have declined. Nguni- and Sotho-speaking adults in the first week of January spent a daily average of two hours and nine minutes in front of the television set with 77% of the total number of adults watching any channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC 2 scored highest with 71% of all adults watching television. In particular, Afrikaans and English adults spend a daily average of two hours three minutes watching television, with 61% of these viewers glued to SABC 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEDIA IN BRIEF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosmopolitan's July to December 1996 Audit Bureau Circulation figures show a 4% increase on its last audit, as well as an increase of 9 000 copies sold in the past 18 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a market with increasing competition and generally decreasing circulations, we are delighted to be one of the very few mainstream magazines showing an increase,&quot; says Cosmopolitan editor Vanessa Raphaely. &quot;Cosmo's performance is all the more pleasing bearing in mind that new competitors have been launched and that more mature brands have been pursuing aggressive advertising and circulation boosting strategies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE SABC has forged new markets in African countries and the Caribbean via its programme sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public broadcaster recently sold programmes to Zambia, Zimbabwe and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamaica has bought Suburban Bliss, Generations and African Focus, among others. Trinidad and Tobago are also broadcasting some of our local dramas.  Even the United States, France and Germany have imported SABC programmes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Newspaper houses are planning to spend close to a million in an attempt to scupper the government's crackdown on tobacco advertising, reports Jacquie Golding-Duffy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAJOR newspaper houses are planning to spend close to R1-million to fight the government's crackdown on lucrative tobacco advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents in the Mail &amp; Guardian's possession show that nearly half of the proposed amount will be spent on outside consultants, who will be expected to lobby in government corridors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper companies, joined by advertising agencies in the plan, say the proposals are driven by their constitutional right to freedom of commercial speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government will find it increasingly difficult to push through its planned restrictions on the advertising of liquor, tobacco and milk substitutes if the industries approve the proposal to initiate the campaign.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Print Media Association (PMA), an umbrella body consisting of various magazine and newspaper affiliates, recently set up the Media Industry Committee on the Freedom of Commercial Speech. This committee was established:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* in the short term, to delay tobacco legislation and create the basis for ongoing consultation; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* in the long term, to create a platform for regular consultation (with the government) on matters affecting what the industry sees as its commercial interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some time the PMA has had a committee to fight against restrictions on tobacco advertising. But, following the association's congress last year, the new committee was convened and broadened its brief to be the &quot;defence of freedom of commercial speech&quot;, rather than be product specific. This newly formed committee got support from clients and media owners including the International Advertising Association and the Public Relations Institute of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also has observer status for some media industry stakeholders, including the Freedom of Expression Institute, the South African National Editors' Forum and the National Association of Broadcasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We work from a couple of premises including that if it is legal to produce something, then it should be legal to promote it,&quot; said Neil Jacobsohn, chair of the committee and Times Media Limited's deputy chief operating officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the committee's chief focus is to engage the government on a consultative basis and prevent groups with a common goal of freedom of commercial speech from duplicating efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobsohn recently sent a document to the various general managers and chief executives at Independent Newspapers, Perskor and Nasionale Media, among others, in a bid to lobby support for the planned year-long campaign to fight the government restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobsohn said this week that consultants had been hired to devise a freedom of commercial speech strategy and present it to the media and advertising industries. The presentation to industry players took place on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With legislation restricting tobacco and liquor advertising imminent, newspaper houses feel they have the right to defend their commercial interests. Cigarette advertising remains one of the major sources of ad revenue and was worth close to R180-million in the past year. According to the All Media and Product Survey, adspend on tobacco and related products for the year ended July 1996 across the entire industry was R176-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this, Jacobsohn says, the committee is not a tobacco lobby but is dealing with the &quot;principles&quot; of commercial speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are therefore not accepting funding from any tobacco or liquor body. We are not pretending that we do not have a vested interest, but at the same time it is legitimate for us to defend our commercial enterprises,&quot; Jacobsohn says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't tell you what steps we are embarking on, but I can confirm that consultants have been hired and they will be presenting us with a report.  Assuming the plan devised by the consultants is accepted, we will be presenting it to the Marketing Industry Trust,&quot; said Jacobsohn, adding that the envisaged year-long campaign could be estimated at about R1- million. He argued that the consultants fee will be a &quot;mere fraction of this cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For God's sake do not write a story saying we are hiring consultants at a cost of R1- million,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the documents show that more than half of the R900 000 needed for the campaign will be spent on consultants. Sent to various newspaper stables, the documents also outline the proposed budget for the campaign, which is summarised at the back of the memorandum for the perusal of industry players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobsohn details, among other things, that strategic consultants O2 (Dr Thomas Oosthuizen and colleagues) will assist with preparing a strategic plan.  About R460 000 is expected to go to consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consultant and full-time manager of the committee Graham Langmead receives R144 000 per annum, plus out-of-pocket expenses and incidentals (R56 000). A consultancy fee to O2 for strategy, lobbying and overseeing of programming is given at R260 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobsohn notes in the memo that the consultancy fees to Langmead and O2 &quot; may seem high&quot;, adding: &quot;But this will be a tremendous time-intensive campaign in terms of personal meetings, lobbying, etcetera, for the next 12 months and I believe that will earn their fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None of the PMA members, fully employed as we all are by our own companies, have the necessary time to dedicate to this critical campaign. Hence full- time consultants are essential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobsohn is cautious to add that incidentals and out-of-pocket expenses by consultants will be scrutinised and approved by the committee before payment is made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time the document was sent by Jacobsohn, it had the full support of the Association of Marketeers and the Association of Advertising Agencies (AAA). However, a mandate was still needed from the PMA and its affiliate, the National Press Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PMA assistant general manager Estelle du Toit says she would &quot;hate to shoot the proposal down&quot; and refused to say anything that would &quot;jeopardise&quot; the planned move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But The Star's general manager Graham King was not convinced that the exorbitant fees proposed for the consultants can be justified. &quot;The Independent group is not in favour of how the budget is being structured. We believe it can be improved,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Langmead said he could not expand on any of the proposals as it would be &quot; morally wrong&quot; to do so before informing stakeholders of the details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chair of the Marketing Industry Trust and the AAA, John Little, says he is unaware of the proposed budget and has to wait for it to be presented to him for approval. The trust has to be approached for funds. The funds will be drawn from the 0,65% advertising levy included in media rates, which, in turn is collected by the South African Advertising Research Foundation on all display advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This levy is then handed to the trust, which will allocate money to the foundation and to the Advertising Standards Authority. &quot;If there are funds remaining, and the committee that is applying for funds is confident that its initiatives will benefit the industry, then a portion of the funds will be allocated to that committee,&quot; Little said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the mining industry, the proof of the pudding is in productivity. And in an industry where production hit a 40-year low last year, the story of a newly qualified miner at Gengold's Beatrix mine is inspiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 24-shift month he achieved a face advance - the rate at which a mine develops - of 30m when the industry average for the same period is just 10m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half South Africa's gold reserves have been mined since gold was discovered in 1886, and much of the rest requires deep mining to retrieve.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The strength of hard-rock mining is in the people and they are the key to increasing productivity,&quot; says Gengold's managing director Tom Dale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gengold is spending between R50-million and R60-million a year on a programme to train a new generation of miners. Apartheid job reservation on the mines meant that black miners could not get blasting certificates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gengold's education project is open to all miners and offers them adult basic education up to standard seven, from where they are offered the chance to study full- time towards a blasting certificate. The adult basic education requirement is essential as a study by the mining house conducted three years ago found that 95% of its black employees were functionally illiterate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure commitment from workers, attendance at the adult basic education programme is voluntary and must be taken after hours. But the programme is free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think we can double labour productivity with this programme,&quot; says Dale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every four months, 80 qualified new miners hit the rock-face on Gengold's mines. The group estimated that it needs 1 000 miners to meet its productivity targets and that the entire project will be completed in two years' time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all miners who enter the literacy project will end up as qualified miners with blasting certificates. But their standard seven certificates do fit into the National Qualifications Framework, which makes for greater portability across other industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dale says the &quot;higher density of educated, trained miners&quot; will also reduce the number of accidents on mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JCI's Randfontein mine is pioneering a similar change in labour practices.  Joint decision-making underground has seen face advance treble. In a survey of workers at Randfontein, 83 of the 93 sampled said they preferred the new underground method of work; 92 out of 98 said they felt they were involved in decision-making. Workers said better bonuses, team-work and multi- skilling were all important pluses to the new ways of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analyst Dennis Tucker of the firm Fleming Martin Securities says JCI is &quot; altering management and working practices that are more than 100 years old - and that's something special&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglogold is also looking to its workforce to keep its mines profitable.  Together with new deep-mining technology and mineral- rights swaps, improved production is vital to the country's richest gold-mining company. For the first time, Anglogold has set productivity targets for miners. On average, the company wants a 16% hike in production for this year. The targets have been set by the National Union of Mineworkers and management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglogold's chief executive Bobby Godsell says: &quot;We have for the very first time set public labour productivity improvement targets. It's probably the most vital aspect of our business. We can't determine the gold price, we can't determine the grade of gold in the ground but we can manage the efficiency with which we get it out of the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Productivity targets carry bonuses when workers meet or exceed them. Mining houses say that many miners take home anything between double and five times their wages. The union was not available to confirm or comment on productivity bonuses or changed work methods on gold mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But researcher Pete Lewis, who works for the Industrial Health and Research Group, warns that there is a &quot;direct conflict between productivity bonuses and health and safety&quot;. Most productivity bonus agreements have built-in safety clauses that penalise unsafe work practices. Lewis says this may lead to underground accidents being concealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randgold's results for the last quarter outshone other mining houses. The mining house was not available for comment on its new work practices, though an analysis of the company's results suggests it is opting for flattened management structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group is also reaping the benefits of a project to reduce the number of lost blasts - unproductive blasting practices. Buffels mine, for example, has reduced lost blasts by 98%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fleming's Tucker has been tracking the changing work practices across the gold- mining industry and calls them &quot;brilliant&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says: &quot;At last miners are being offered some dignity by multi-skilling and training.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - With market sentiment on its side, now would be a good time for South Africa to act on exchange controls, a US economist tells Madeleine Wackernagel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE subject on everybody's lips at this year's Soci't' G'n'rale Frankel Pollack investment conference was exchange controls. But the governor of the Reserve Bank wasn't talking, and neither was the finance minister, except to reiterate their commitment to a gradual relaxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that anybody, realistically, expected a sudden capitulation to market pressure for a &quot;big bang&quot;. David Hale, one of several overseas speakers, even went so far as to concede that while foreign investors may desire it, they weren't insistent on it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The markets can live without a big bang as long as some targets are set, soon. And we must see some progress soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sentiment towards South Africa has turned around in the past four months, so now would be a good time to issue policy details, while the markets are still benign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most developing economies have some form of controls but the obvious gap in this country is an opportunity for the corporate sector to invest abroad.  There is a great bank of capital here waiting to go somewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hale, global economic strategist and senior vice-president of Zurich Kemper Investments, Chicago, and no stranger to these shores, believes the rand stands out as a good currency right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interest rates in the United States and Europe are very low, which immediately makes the South African market more attractive. That could, of course, change if wage pressures become too great in the US, and the Federal Reserve Board decides to lift rates in a bid to dampen inflationary pressures, but such a move won't come as a great shock. It will have been discounted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd rather invest in rand-denominated bonds at this stage than in a higher- yield Russian bond, for example. The rand market is very attractive, and though I'm a speculator by instinct, sky-high yields have a tendency to collapse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One cloud hanging over South Africa's prospects is the gold price and the perceived threat of gold sales by European central banks in anticipation of achieving European monetary union (Emu) in time for January 1 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even this fear could well prove unfounded, says Hale. &quot;Emu is looking increasingly shaky. I believe there is a 50% chance of the whole thing collapsing, which would give the gold price an immediate boost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In times of turmoil, gold is the traditional safe haven. This time will be no different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cracks have certainly begun to appear in the Emu edifice, despite assurances by Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Jacques Chirac of France that the foundations are in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The European Union is suffering from high unemployment because of rigid labour markets, burdensome levels of taxation, and a general lack of micro- economic flexibility, which raise disturbing questions about whether Europe is an optimal currency area. So it is not difficult to construct scenarios whereby Emu is postponed for several years or self- destructs because of rising unemployment in the early part of the next century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In either case, bullion could rally sharply as fears of central bank sales recede,&quot; says Hale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if Emu is successful and European central banks do sell down their holdings, gold need not necessarily pay the price. The Asian central banks are potential customers for excess supplies as their holdings of bullion are insignificant compared with their large stocks of foreign currency reserves.  An obvious candidate is the People's Republic of China, with more than $110- billion of forex reserves invested mainly in dollar securities, which it may consider diversifying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Hale: &quot;It is unlikely that with China emerging as a major economic and military rival to the US in Asia it would want to keep its foreign reserves almost entirely in US Treasury securities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the South African economy becomes less dependent on gold for export earnings, other markets have to be investigated. On this topic Hale is adamant: the trade liberalisation policies embarked upon in the past few years have to be continued and expanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The private and public sectors must work with the unions, much as happened in Australia in the 1980s, when it realised growth was lagging well behind that of the Asian tigers. The labour government of the time embarked on a programme of financial deregulation and tariff abolition while also negotiating a series of wage/price accords with the trade unions to keep the process on track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Australian example is one South Africa should study closely because it demonstrates the importance of trade liberalisation to promote micro-economic reform in a country with a large natural resource endowment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this context, rapid implementation of the government's growth, employment and redistribution strategy is crucial, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no quick-fix solutions to South Africa's socio-economic problems, &quot; says Hale. &quot;I'm impressed that the government has managed popular expectations so far, but without short-term tensions, such as Budget cuts, there will be no long-term solutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africa's fastest-growing farmworkers' union - the South African Agricultural Plantation and Allied Workers Union (Saapawu) - is meeting on Friday, February 21, in its first-ever congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the top of its agenda is a plan to counter the South African Agricultural Union's (SAAU) lobby against the Security of Tenure Bill.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union representative Dickson Motha says: &quot;We have a problem with evictions and we are going to respond to the SAAU.&quot; The union also plans to begin lobbying against the continued use of child labour in the agricultural industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saapawu is affiliated to the Congress of South African Trade Unions and in the past two years has collected a paid-up membership of 33 000 workers. &quot;The figure is below expectations but there were many retrenchments during last season's drought,&quot; says Motha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been no easy task organising in the industry, where a lack of resources makes it very difficult to build up membership as unionists often don't have access to transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Canham of the Farmworkers Research and Resource Project says that farms are not like factories. Trade unions in that sector need to organise very differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Work and living conditions, for example, are equally important,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds that trade unions need to begin working out methods of increasing membership on small farms because &quot;the majority of farms have less than 10 workers, whereas unions concentrate on farms with more than 20 workers&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Controversy surrounds the proposed Bill to convert the Development Bank of South Africa into a company, writes Lynda Loxton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW parliamentary finance committee chairman Sipho Mpahlwa had a baptism of fire this week when the committee once again flexed its muscles and refused to rubber stamp an important Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appointed on February 17, Mpahlwa almost immediately had to cope with a crisis that saw the Finance Department's director general, Maria Ramos, rush down to Cape Town in a vain bid to soothe the committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday the committee refused to approve a Bill aimed at giving the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) legal status and convert it into a company as it felt that all the interested parties had not been consulted and it did not want to approve the Bill in haste only to repent later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, it asked the DBSA and the Finance Department to resolve differences concerning the planned change with interested parties and report back as soon as possible.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If these differences could not be resolved, public hearings would be held, possibly on March 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramos said this would have no effect on the government's full support for the DBSA, which taps about R1-billion from the financial market each year to fund infrastructure projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rejection of the Bill followed objections from several organisations hastily consulted on Tuesday night after minority parties in the committee had expressed reservations about several aspects of the Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formed in 1983 through a treaty between the former South African government and its so- called black homelands, the DBSA was thrown into a legal limbo following the adoption of the new Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DBSA chief executive Dr Ian Goldin told the committee that the Bill would give the bank legal status and provide it with a share capital of R5-billion, of which R2-billion would be held by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would help the bank retain its AAA rating in the face of the withdrawal of government guarantees and allow it to continue to provide low- interest loans to high-risk infrastructure projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldin said its AAA rating was also important as the bank had not received any government funding since 1994 and about 75% of its funding came from the financial markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramos told the committee that after extensive consultation with interested parties, it had been decided that the bank should be converted into a company and should concentrate on providing concessional finance for infrastructure projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Party and Inkatha Freedom Front committee members questioned the fact that the DBSA was not formally being turned into a bank and therefore made subject to all the necessary financial controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also wanted to know whether all the interested parties that could be affected by the bank becoming a company had been consulted and if it would not, in fact, pose unfair competition to commercial banks and other government financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Congress committee members were concerned about who had been consulted about the Bill and faxes were hastily sent to organisations such as the Council of South African Banks, the Registrar of Companies, the Department of Trade and Industry and its business finance house, Khula Enterprise Finance Limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, committee members were dismayed to receive faxes from some of these saying they had not been consulted about the final draft of the Bill, believed it would give the bank an unfair advantage or would give it powers to encroach on their territories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some committee members who had not attended Tuesday's meetings expressed misgivings that converting the bank into a company could open the way for &quot; privatisation by stealth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramos admitted that the Bill had only been published on January 24 and that some interested parties might not have had time to study it. But she said they had all been broadly consulted about the Bill and its aims, which had formed part of the transformation of the bank in the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said it had been decided after taking legal advice that it would be best to convert the bank into a company, along the lines of the Industrial Development Corporation, rather than a bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would not be a deposit-taking institution, but would raise funds in the market for infrastructure projects that other banks regarded as too risky to support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was true that the bank had in the past granted loans for other projects but this had been because of its historic role of funding the former homelands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It, therefore, had loans that supported small business, but these would be transferred to Khula. It also had land acquisition loans, and these would be transferred to the Land Bank when it had completed its restructuring process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank was not involved in housing loans and would leave these to the National Housing Finance Corporation. &quot;It is not the objective of the DBSA to compete in any way with the private sector,&quot; Ramos said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said it was also not the aim to open up the way for the privatisation of the bank and it would be a statutory body subject to the control of Parliament.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Bullish on the rand -- * THE rand was trading slightly firmer to the dollar at R4,4670 in an active week of trade. The currency reached a high of R4,38 before losing some of its gains as the dollar strengthened. Dealers are bullish about the currency in the short-term, but say foreign investors will be keeping a close eye on local developments. The rand was also trading weaker against sterling, costing R7,23. The R150 long bond was two points stronger at 14,71%.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downturn on Wall Street</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A SUDDEN late sell-off mid-week saw prices on Wall Street turn down. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 47,33 points to close at 7 020,13.  Analysts said computerised selling contributed to the sharpness of the decline, compounded by investor concern that a downward correction may be in the offing from the inflated levels of the past several months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Record US trade gap</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* THE United States trade deficit surged to $114,2-billion last year, the worst performance since 1988, as the gap with China hit a record and the price of crude oil rose to the highest level in six years. The Commerce Department said the deficit in goods and services for all of 1996 was up 8,7%.  The US's trade deficit stood at $38,8-billion in 1992 and has risen every year that President Bill Clinton has been in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomson sell-off</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* RELAUNCHING the troubled privatisation of electronics and defence firm Thomson CSF, the French government said it will again try to sell the company to one buyer. The Finance Ministry said the sale would include a set of unspecified conditions. These will seek to avoid the problems of the first attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telecom for sale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* FRANCE'S partial privatisation of France Telecom will begin on May 20 with the planned sale of 20% of the company's capital. The government has said the sale, expected to be the largest share offer in French history, will raise about 25-billion francs, preparing the phone company to compete after the European-mandated telephone deregulation in 1998.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South African companies are under pressure to take a stand on the Swazi strike, reports Max Gebhardt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH AFRICA'S Transport and General Workers Union has vowed to intensify its campaign against South African companies invested in Swaziland as the Swazi general strike moves into its fourth week. The union will meet shop stewards next week to discuss plans for a &quot;blacking action&quot; against various South African companies in solidarity with the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union's general secretary, Randall Howard, said it was considering proposals whereby union members would refuse to transport South African goods destined for Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has already identified two companies, Unitrans and Cargo Carriers, in an attempt to make South African groups take a stand on the labour unrest in Swaziland. The union has called on both companies to use their strategic position in the Swazi economy to &quot;publicly condemn the dictatorial and repressive actions of the Swaziland government&quot; and call on the Swazi government to &quot;ensure full respect for human and trade-union rights&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swazi union decided to call for a two- day national strike in response to the government's failure to agree to 25 demands tabled by the union in 1994. Central to the union's demand is the revoking of the 1973 decree banning opposition parties and trade unions in the kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting head of the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions, Baba Dlamini, said multinationals investing in Swaziland were &quot;cowards&quot; for not condemning the Swazi government's actions during the strike. Four of the union's most senior members were arrested on charges of alleged intimidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will place every possible pressure on South African companies invested in Swaziland to take a stand against the tyrannical Swazi government,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congress of South African Trade Unions said a one-day blockade of the landlocked kingdom would be held early next month. A representative said the trade union was also busy identifying companies invested in Swaziland in an effort to place pressure on them to call for democratic reform in the kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But South African companies contacted by the Mail &amp; Guardian refused to be drawn into events in Swaziland, saying it could harm their business interests there. They would continue doing &quot;business as usual&quot;. All were unwilling to publicly condemn the Swazi government's actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sappi chairman Eugene van As said the forestry group had been affected by the strike, which was costing the company a great deal of money in lost revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sappi is disturbed that the two sides haven't been able to settle their differences and we would like to see the parties resolve their differences peacefully and speedily.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unitrans chairman, Eduardo Guti'rrez- Garcia, said in a letter to Howard: &quot;.  .. the interests of the trade unions and those of employers do not always run parallel to each other because ... the unions act in pursuit of certain political objectives which, worthy as they may be, could not be publicly embraced by business enterprises ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garcia did say it would use whatever influence and power of persuasion it had in the Swazi government to bring about a just and fair resolution of the current dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cargo Carriers joint chief executive Murray Bolton cautioned against meddling in the affairs of a foreign country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only way that the Swaziland situation will be resolved is for appropriate independent third parties to be brought in to initiate negotiations and work towards a tripartite consensus on a future dispensation, &quot; Bolton said in a letter to the union.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Group human resource director Rob Rimmer said it would be foolhardy to adopt a confrontational stand towards the Swazi government. The unions, he said, were championing political change, which fell outside the ambit of a company's responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The universe is bigger and older than first believed, but sci-fi writer JG Ballard sees space as a vacuum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New evidence shows that previous assumptions about space were wrong, reports Lesley Cowling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SOUTH AFRICAN astronomer this week presented evidence to international cosmologists that the observable universe is 10% larger than previously supposed. This means that the universe is also older than astronomers have calculated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Feast, professor emeritus at the University of Cape Town and former director of the South African Astronomical Observatory, this week told a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Seattle that direct measurements of stars by a custom- designed satellite showed that previous calculations of the distances of these stars from Earth were inaccurate. Recalculation resulted in longer distances and a larger universe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feast and his team's conclusions are the result of a long and time- consuming process, starting with the 1989 launch of the Hipparcos satellite, designed by European scientists and engineers to fix the precise positions in the sky of 120 000 stars and log another million with slightly less accuracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feast was asked before the launch for his input and suggested that Hipparcos measure the distance of a number of variable stars - the winking stars known as Cepheids and the pulsating type called Miras. Variable stars are used by astronomers to calculate distances across the universe, using a technique and calculations similar to those used by land surveyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until Hipparcos, these measurements were made from earth, starting with the nearest stars, using those measurements as the basis for measuring other stars. &quot;But when you're working from the earth's surface, it's like being at the bottom of a swimming pool,&quot; says Patricia Whitelock, one of the research team. The earth's atmosphere gets in the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as the Hubble telescope takes clearer pictures from space than from earth, Hipparcos took more accurate measurements. The satellite collected data for four years, until 1993. Then the European Space Agency's scientists took another two years to do all the basic calculations and to hand those results to the various scientists involved in the initial research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took Feast's team of South African, British and Russian cosmologists some more months to work out their conclusions, and they are still waiting for results coming in from other scientists working with Hipparcos data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as Cepheids being further away, these young pulsating stars are also more luminous than previously thought, the calculations show. Cepheid stars alternately squeeze themselves and relax, like a beating heart. They wax and wane rhythmically in brightness, every few days or weeks, at a rate that depends on how bright they are. Henrietta Leavitt at the Harvard College Observatory discovered in the early years of this century that bigger and more brilliant Cepheids vary with a longer period, according to a strict rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the calculations of Feast's team also solve a problem astronomers recently had when the oldest stars in the universe were calculated to be older than the universe itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope we've cured a nonsensical contradiction that was a headache for cosmologists,&quot; Michael Feast says. &quot;We judge the universe to be a little bigger and therefore a little older, by about a billion years. The oldest stars seem to be much younger than supposed, by about 4 billion years. If we can settle on an age of the universe at, say, 12-billion years everything will fit nicely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Perryman, European Space Agency project scientist for Hipparcos, anticipates a warm debate among astronomers. Should the Hipparcos Cepheid results be taken at face value, with all their implications for the size and age of the universe? He remains confident that the issue will be settled by other results quarried from the Hipparcos data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until Hipparcos, the cosmic distance scale rested on well-informed guesses, &quot; Perryman says. &quot;The distances we now have, for stars of many kinds, provide for the very first time a firm foundation from which to gauge the distances of galaxies. The work has only just begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it should turn out that the Cepheids have given the final answer straight away, that might be surprising. But there will be no reason for astonishment when Hipparcos's direct measurements of stellar distances lead to a revised scale for the universe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Politicians need to consider the social dynamics behind gun proliferation, argues Wits sociology professor Jacklyn Cock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUN violence is about contested social identities. This is evident in the case of the Kalashnikov assault rifle, the AK-47. I want to use this particular weapon to introduce some of the key themes in a sociological analysis of gun violence in the South African social order, to demonstrate the value of an applied sociology that links history, theory, empirical social data and contemporary social issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AK-47 is not just a gun; it is a potent symbol of conflict. Since it was first produced in 1947 some 70-million AKs have been manufactured. It has been described as the most effective assault weapon in the world and has changed the way wars are fought forever.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the AK is invested with powerful symbolic force, this is also true of other types of weaponry - for example the tank is one of the century's most potent global symbols - a symbol of the repressive power of the authoritarian state - illustrated by events in Budapest in 1956; Prague in 1968; Tiananmen Square in 1989. Similarly, the machine gun represented the power of the imperial armies, while the AK is an icon of revolutionary resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Especially during the apartheid era for many young black South Africans, the AK became a mythic icon, a &quot;marker&quot; of group identity; a kind of code to assert one's political allegiance that carried great significance for individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current global problem of gun violence is a social issue; guns have become embedded in the identities of diverse social groupings. In the post- Cold War world, violence is increasingly about contested identities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussions of the supply of guns to South Africa tend to focus exclusively on one source - cross-border smuggling of AK-47s by Mozambican ex-combatants.  The issue is more complex; the supply of guns is deeply embedded in the South African social and economic order. Struggles over access to guns and land were crucial themes in our past. Today, the supply of guns through the illegal arms trade is connected to many other social and economic activities which include the trade in ivory, rhino horn, diamonds, teak, drugs and even second-hand clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indigenous arms industry was built on linkages with most of South Africa's major manufacturing companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small arms are locally produced. The Denel subsidiary, Lyttleton Engineering, in Verwoerdburg (LIW), produces:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The R4 and R5 automatic assault rifles, which are the standard weapons in the South African National Defence Force and the South African Police Service.  According to their marketing blurb, &quot;these are developments of the AK-47 assault rifle&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Vektor small arms range, which sells about 15 000 pistols a year to the civilian market;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Vektor CP1 9mm parabellum compact pistol &quot;is now available at your nearest gun dealer&quot; for about R2 500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the main weapons of violent crime is the 9mm pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As regards the illegal arms market, there are three main sources of supply:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Smuggling of small arms across the porous borders of Swaziland, Namibia and Mozambique into South Africa is common. These smugglers then link up with highly organised criminal networks. One of my informants obtained his 9mm pistol simply by shooting the gang member who offered to sell it to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Illegal imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Leaks from poorly controlled state armouries and security force personnel. The pistol which killed Chris Hani was obtained in a raid from a state armoury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current proliferation of arms is not only a legacy of apartheid. In several ways the post-apartheid state is encouraging this proliferation and thus contributing to the erosion of its own authority. It is doing so through its support for the import, and especially the manufacture, of small arms, through the encouragement of private gun ownership in the form of liberal licensing, through the extensive arming of the security forces and weak control over their weaponry. Several informants maintained that security force personnel - especially poorly paid policemen - were themselves involved in the illegal arms trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequent proliferation of the means of violence, through multiple channels to all levels of society, is one of the most distinctive features of contemporary South African society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social categories involved with small arms include not only criminal networks and political groupings with paramilitary formations, but also sportsmen, including hunters, mercenaries, self-defence units, the security forces, citizens and private security firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These overlapping social categories include very different people. My argument is that small arms are often the basis of a militarised identity that is lethally connected to gender, ethnicity, race, nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But analysing gun violence as a social phenomenon involves more than exploring individual biographies, motives and meanings; it also involves examining the diverse social organisations, cultural frameworks, social practices, group attachments, and institutions built up around guns.  Collectively these constitute a robust &quot;gun culture&quot; in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The values, social practices and institutions which together constitute this gun culture include what Raymond Williams calls &quot;consumerist militarism&quot;.  It involves the normalisation - and even glorification - of war, weaponry, military force and violence through TV, films, books, songs, dances, games, sports and toys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toy guns are a significant component of this culture - a total of 48 different varieties of toy guns were on offer at a Johannesburg shop in December 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of these cultural forms constitute a kind of &quot;banal militarism&quot; which operates near the surface of social life. It is embedded in everyday activities and works through prosaic routines and rituals to make war, weaponry and violence appear natural and inevitable. It is exemplified in war games such as paintball, which simulates killing and has become increasingly popular among white South Africans since 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This gun culture contains a highly heterogeneous set of resources; it does not only operate to glamourise war and weaponry, but also to &quot;normalise&quot; these social practices. Part of this &quot;normalisation&quot; is the notion that private gun ownership is legitimate; it is a right, not a privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key institution which promotes this notion is the South African Gun Owners' Association (Saga). In 1995 Saga organised 14 410 petitions to the Constitutional Assembly, stating that the Constitution should be amended to recognise the right to own firearms and to place a limitation on government's power to disarm the civilian population. Saga maintains that &quot;the anti- gun lobby's emphasis should not be on guns. It should be on people. Guns are to crime as cameras are to pornography, but they don't ban cameras.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notion that private gun ownership is legitimate is linked to the notion that guns are a necessary form of protection. Now, the gun combines two contradictory images - it is a means of both order and of violence; paradoxically it is believed to provide protection from violence through the potential threat of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the 1980s there has been a &quot;privatisation of security&quot;, as increasing numbers of citizens have lost confidence in the state to protect them, and have come to rely on individual gun ownership, diverse forms of vigilantism and private security arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A common theme articulated by many of my informants who had purchased guns for self protection was a sense of being powerless. But the psychodynamic power of the gun as protection is largely illusionary; legally owned weapons contribute to the problem of violent crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that over 17 000 licensed firearms probably fell into criminal hands last year dramatises the dangerously self- contradictory potential of guns as a means of protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To a diverse number of young South African men guns are a mark of status, and signal a particular style. For example, to many members of organised crime syndicates in Soweto, ostentatiously displayed firearms indicate the status of being a &quot;big man&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the style that guns signal is not restricted to political allegiance or criminal defiance. Guns are a form of social display which can signal male affluence as well. Among a diverse group of young men informants - not only gang members from Soweto, but also middle-class men from Lenasia and Sandton - guns seem important as a means of social display, and firearms compete with cellphones for pride of place on a man's belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women's response to this militarised masculinity is ambiguous. In South Africa increasing numbers of women are purchasing guns, which could indicate that a male style is being homogenised and spread more widely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gendered nature of gun violence is significant; but gender, class, race and ethnic identities are inseparable; they construct and reinforce each other. Much gun violence relates to deep-seated fears that are grounded in racial and ethnic identities which are antagonistically defined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present, for many South Africans, ethnic identities are the strongest source of social cohesion. The mobilisation of ethnicity to secure economic and political goals by Inkatha has deepened animosities along ethnic lines, and the supply of weaponry enables these animosities to be expressed in lethal ways. Similarly, some right-wing Afrikaner groupings have mobilised around a politicised ethnicity, and have formed armed, paramilitary organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The availability of guns encourages these militant political groups to engage in violent rather than democratic opposition. In 1996, for the first time, guns were killing people more than any other weapon in political conflict in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns are connected to various overlapping social identities, particularly those defined by gender, race, class, age, political affiliation, nationality and ethnicity. All of these are strong representations of common interests and carry powerful mobilising sentiments within them. They are all relational identities; they involve boundaries demarcating &quot;us&quot; from &quot;them&quot;; they mark lines of difference which perceptions of external threat, and access to weaponry make potentially lethal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any solution to the proliferation of guns has to deal with these social relations and contested identities. At present the state has established a number of structures to come up with policy proposals to reduce the number of firearms available to the general public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a control policy that ignores the historically and socially constructed meanings attached to firearms will not be effective; we need to alter the allegiances and identities which underly acts of gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This piece is an edited version of Jacklyn Cock's inaugural lecture, given this week</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Dear Walter, BUDGET Day is fast approaching, a time of great excitement in the government - particularly in the office of the minister of finance, who can be heard late at night chanting &quot;five sixes are 30, six sixes are 36, seven sixes are 42 ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also, of course, a time of much activity on the part of lobbyists.  The smoking industry is trying to persuade us that citizens of this land of freedom have a constitutional right to gas themselves to death cheaply - in the expectation that they, too, will share an international passport to smoking pleasure in the hereafter. And the breweries are anxious to reduce the nation to a cut-rate asylum for dipsomaniacs with the help of their plasticised brews. Not to mention various former front companies for Military Intelligence demanding the immediate reintroduction of government subsidies for the manufacturers of Mandrax tablets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among these pressure groups, which are self-evidently driven by a selfish greed for profit, there does emerge the occasional petitioner who gladdens the heart by their transparent commitment to the national interest, high principle and fair play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One such lobby approached me this week, in the form of the National Association of Federated Chambers of Commerce, known among its admirers as Nafcoc. This august body presented me with a petition, signed by its one million subscribers and various hangers-on, appealing for a tax amnesty for black people. They demanded a complete write-off of all tax, and penalties and interest on unpaid tax owing from the period before April 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a closely reasoned presentation in triplicate they explained that, contrary to popular misconception, the involvement of their members in commercial activity during the apartheid era was not profit-motivated, but an integral part of the liberation struggle. The strategy had been to make lots of money and undermine the government by hiding it all in socks underneath their beds, thereby rendering the country ungovernable, reducing PW Botha to a mumbling wreck and driving FW de Klerk to the negotiating table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having achieved their aim with such breath- taking effect after much sacrifice, it was now manifestly unfair for this guerrilla army of small and medium business enterprises to be penalised by paying tax on what were essentially weapons of war, the very instruments of liberation - to whit, the numerous clinking socks stashed under their members' beds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To assist the government in establishing the credentials of applicants for this proposed amnesty, they submitted a draft tax form headed &quot;IRP-Zero&quot; which, they suggested, should be completed by all taxpayers. Questions included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does your best friend consider you to be dark-black/light-black/sort-of- black/blackish/black-with-pink-polka- dots/pinkish/salmon pink/Colin Eglin- pink?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have you ever had a pencil stuck in your hair?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Andre Markgraaff a friend of yours?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regrettably, I had to turn them down. I recognise they are true heroes of the liberation struggle. But you know what dab hands Pik Botha and his friends are with the boot polish.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still reeling from its latest legal blow, the truth commission said it would release a press statement this Friday after pondering the judgment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corbett, who has been succeeded as chief justice by Ismail Mahomed, ruled in favour of two retired policemen who have applied for amnesty for the murder of student leader Siphiwe Mtimkulu. They claimed they had not been given reasonable notice that Mtimkulu's widow, Joyce, would finger them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission now has to give &quot;timeous and reasonable&quot; notice to perpetrators who are to be named - a requirement which will inevitably retard its work. The commission is not bound by the rules of court process, to allow it to effect a broad expos' of apartheid atrocities relatively swiftly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision follows the recent Cape Supreme Court ruling that a person cannot be prosecuted for an offence which occurred more than 20 years in the past. Cape Attorney General Frank Kahn said it would be &quot;devastating if this judgment is used as an argument before the truth commission&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - New Chief Justice Ismail Mahomed's concern about the moral fibre of the nation doesn't mean the law will concern itself only with morality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUDGE Ismail Mahomed went to Bloemfontein last week to start work as the new chief justice. He gave a short interview to SABC television, in which he took the opportunity to voice serious concern about the erosion of the moral fibre of this nation and about corruption. The judiciary, he said, must act to restore morality, albeit not merely by the imposition of harsh prison sentences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These words are welcome because for far too long our courts lagged behind the democratic world in infusing our law with morality; but equally, the public ought not to conclude from this short statement that henceforth law will concern itself only with morality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It cannot do that, because it is a system of rules that is concerned with many more interests than just morality. Indeed, sometimes the interests protected by law diverge quite sharply from morality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is shown in our law of contract, which, in part, is moral, and in part merely sound commercial common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rule that holds a person to the promise that he or she makes (to sell or lease property, for instance) is clearly a moral precept. It is immoral to break bargains and promises, and the law prohibits this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the rule that binds a person to the letter of the written contract he or she signed, regardless of whether it was read or understood or how onerous the terms are, is not a moral rule and can often have harsh consequences that benefit rich and powerful institutions at the expense of poor or even indigent individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judges are generally not naive, and most will confess privately that they know many people do not read the fine print of their insurance contracts, their leases, their hire-purchase agreements and even their antenuptial contracts. Yet daily they enforce such agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for this is the requirement of a modern commercial society, which is what we are. Contracts and other instruments often have consequences for other parties. They can be passed around and traded. Without a rigid adherence to what is written, the Chinese whispers would soon exaggerate some rights and deflate others to the prejudice of traders down the line and third parties. No one would be really certain of the terms of the contracts and instruments they dealt with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would make trade and commerce very difficult and, to return to the earlier examples, insurance companies would become reluctant to insure persons and property (and drastically raise their premiums when they did), retailers reluctant to sell on credit and institutions reluctant to develop commercial properties for renting out. All this is deleterious to society, hence the strength of a legal rule that owes nothing to morality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our criminal law also derives from hybrid influences. Its rules not only seek to reflect morality, but also to shape the kind of society most people want. Laws against theft and murder are entirely consistent with the religious and cultural heritage of virtually every single person in this land; but the laws requiring drivers to stop at stop streets, bottlestore owners to be validly licensed and individuals not to drop sweet papers in the park, owe nothing to morality but stem from a general desire for municipal orderliness. They just make life easier for everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, law exists not just to enforce the general moral values of the populace; it must also order society and promote commerce. These are complex functions, and while the modern trend is to allow morality more and more to temper the harsher effects of the other ends, South Africa (in common with all other democracies) has not yet reached the stage where there is a simple equation between law and moral values.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Air defence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT NAUDE, as you all know, thinks politicians are full of hot air. So he laughed lekker when he heard what happened at the air-force display of its new Rooivalk Squadron on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ceasefire Campaign planned a protest at Kempton Park where the air force was showing off its helicopters. They brought hot-air balloons to show how taxpayers' money vanishes into thin air when it's spent on Rooivalks. But the police chased them away, saying their balloons would interfere with radar and air control at the airport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ceasefire is now claiming that they discovered a new anti-aircraft weapon, one that's cheaper than Rooivalks, nogal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They reckon Modise and Kasrils should forget the combat helicopters and blast off balloons at the enemy, interfering with their radar and goetes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make love, not war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* JAMMER, but the launch of the Rooivalk Squadron was such a grand affair that the manne voted it get two mentions this week. Defence Minister Joe Modise's speechwriter got so carried away by the occasion he wrote about the &quot; squand-ron&quot;. Maybe he also thinks it's a waste of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modise also said the launch was &quot;an erection of a monument of love by the Rainbow Nation, inside the hearts of its men and women in uniform&quot;. The Rooivalk, &quot;a formidable combat helicopter&quot;, would be used by the air force for &quot;the maintenance of peace, rescue missions and humanitarian support&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a bum rap</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* THE Mail &amp; Guardian published details in January about an Israeli man, Zif Falk, who was arrested at Johannesburg International Airport with R2,4- million worth of uncut diamonds in a condom up his rectum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now they've shared the news with us ouens that Falk was a real honest-to- God rabbi. Says At Naude: &quot;With so much diamonds shoved inside him, he must really be a holy man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the record</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* THE STAR newspaper invited Transport Minister Mac Maharaj for lunch this week. Welcoming him, editor Peter Sullivan jovially said he could relax, everything was off the record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Mac gave it to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He thanked them for the off-the-record meal, and then asked if they really knew what that meant. Sullivan had written in his column on Monday what would be happening in Parliament this year, information that was supplied at off- the- record government briefings to editors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mac also ripped into The Star's political correspondent, Kaizer M Nyatsumba, accusing him of trading in rumours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oom Krisjan's spies say Independent Newspapers' Gauteng grootbaas Deon du Plessis ducked behind his bodyguard so Mac couldn't see his red face.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - National Party leader FW de Klerk is juggling the chicken and the egg, and cannot decide between the two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chicken is the current NP: it clucks about forming a &quot;new new&quot; National Party and scratching for dirt on the African National Congress, particularly in the backyards of the Western Cape, where it struts its stuff and is cocky.  Its life is limited by the 1999 elections, where it is unlikely, in its present form, to attract enough votes to be a powerful force against the ANC in Parliament. Like most chickens, it is doomed for a roasting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The egg - De Klerk's other option - represents the NP's much talked-about opposition movement - an idea on which De Klerk and his former secretary general have been sitting for quite some time. It has not hatched for a year, and this week, under intense pressure from the Afrikaans press and commentators, De Klerk was forced to bring it out and flourish it in public view, to prove that the dream still exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to show further commitment, he stripped his secretary general, Roelf Meyer, of his title and has confined him purely to nurturing the dream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Meyer might feel some personal liberation at being set free from the rest of the NP to pursue his own agenda, there is no guarantee that he, with only his five-person task team, will have the magnetism and power to pull all anti-ANC forces to one sweet centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, his movement beyond the hierarchy of the NP into the political wastelands of the new South Africa will probably be interpreted, in the short term at least, as a demotion for Meyer and a victory for hardliners in the party who disliked his multi-racial approach and his personality - hardliners such as the ambitious Western Cape leader Hernus Kriel and his provincial enthusiasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sense of crisis in the party will mean a further haemorrhaging of NP support in its traditional constituencies, a further weakening of the public image, disillusionment among moderate supporters and general confusion among the electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By creating a division of labour in his party, De Klerk has drawn a line between the past and the future, straight through the middle of his party, and personally, will have to work very hard to prevent it sucking the stronger, more credible members down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he stopped tossing his options around, and concentrated hard on one approach, with a complementary set of principles, and grounded his opposition tactics in a distinct value system, there might be few feathers flying around, and less egg on his face.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The stench arising from the administration of rugby in South Africa is over-powering. If the coaching career of the Springbok coach, Andre Markgraaff, is the immediate casualty of this week's rugby race row, the putrefaction which gives rise to the stink lies with the South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been obvious for years that something has been seriously amiss with the sport. But Louis Luyt's control of the game at a national level - which might well be described as tyrannical - has kept the lid on it. The Markgraaff affair has given a glimpse of the shenanigans which seemingly go on behind the scenes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full facts of the scandal are still emerging, but if the central allegations stand - blackmail, rampant racism and a toleration of both by Sarfu - it is hardly necessary to call for a clean-out at Sarfu headquarters, the demand being so obvious. Even if the allegations do not stand, Luyt must go: his ranting at Minister Steve Tshwete - &quot;no one is my boss in this country and I'll remind him of this in court&quot; - shows a disregard for the national interest in the game which is alone sufficient to disqualify him from its administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most damaging aspect of the Markgraaff affair lies with one word.  The use of the word &quot;kaffir&quot; by Markgraaff is like a slap in the face of Nelson Mandela - the man who, more than any of the 15 players, set the seal on our World Cup triumph; the man who bucked the weight of popular opinion to reward rugby with the Springbok emblem. It is with a sense of shared hurt that we contemplate the K-word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a curiosity about human behaviour that we choose to characterise as obscenities words that are deserving of celebration. The F-word is the most obvious example, as the euphemism for the &quot;obscenity&quot; which describes the font of our humanity - the action which gives rise to our existence and hope of immortality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a similar way the K-word is one which has been artificially clothed in obscenity. Now is a good time to remember that the word &quot;kaffir&quot; stems from the Arabic kafir, which meant an infidel, or un-believer. One of the glories of our Constitution is that we have thrown off the shackles of sectarianism.  Whatever our individual beliefs - which are sacrosanct - we are an infidel state. A nation of kaffirs, Mr President ... and very proud of it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Zimbabwe's human rights record has taken a hammering with a United States official report detailing violations ranging from police brutality to interference in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US State Department's 1996 Country Report on Zimbabwe criticises the government for failing to pursue past allegations of torture and refusing to prosecute police and intelligence officers responsible for such abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It cites the refusal of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) to pay court-ordered damages to a 1990 torture victim belonging to an opposition party. The report also refers to appeals from the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP) for an inquiry into the fate of victims of the army's North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade which conducted counter- insurgency operations in Matabeleland in the 1980s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite calls by the CCJP for an investigation, the government took no action on the bodies discovered at Antelope Mine in Kezi in 1992; the bodies have not been identified or properly buried,&quot; the report says. Examples of police brutality documented include the firing of teargas at striking nurses who were peaceably entering a court in November last year to hear a case against fellow strikers and the beating the same month of students fleeing disturbances at the University of Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to recent elections, the report observes there were &quot;credible reports of continued CIO harassment of independent and opposition candidates and their supporters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political process continued to be tilted in favour of the ruling Zanu- PF party, the report says, although it also ascribes the opposition's poor showing to weak leadership, in-fighting, and lack of coherent platforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says the government influenced the mainstream media through indirect ownership, editorial appointments, directives to editors, and the removal of wayward editors. Despite a supreme court ruling that the government's monopoly of communications was unconstitutional, the government had repeatedly refused to license independent radio and television stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the independent press was increasingly critical of the government, there was a measure of self-censorship aggravated by strict anti-defamation laws, the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the state media has attacked the US, asking: &quot;Is it fair for any country to sit in judgement over others, moralising and pontificating on how the world should be run?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbabane - International trade union leaders flew out of Swaziland this week threatening to blockade the kingdom unless its monarch, King Mswati III, releases four of their colleagues from prison and reforms the archaic system of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four union leaders were jailed for intimidation following a strike lasting nearly three weeks. The courts passed a law after they were arrested, preventing them from being bailed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the detained is Jani Sithole, general secretary of the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland is the only &quot;absolute&quot; monarchy left in sub-Saharan Africa.  Mswati III rules through family and friends, maintaining his reign by refusing to allow the formation of political parties. Only the king's mother, the &quot;Indlovukati&quot; or &quot;Great She-Elephant&quot;, has the power to veto his decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the bad old days of apartheid South Africa and the terrible war in Mozambique, Swaziland was looked upon as a calm place,&quot; one resident said. &quot; Now it sticks out like a sore thumb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Nelson Mandela is losing patience with what is now seen as a regional embarrassment. Last week he called the situation in his tiny neighbour &quot; explosive&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday an American delegate from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions stood in the courthouse in the city of Manzini, watching in amazement as the four union leaders' trial failed to start. The prisoners had been driven to the wrong court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swazi union federation called the strike to try to force the government to introduce democracy. It has presented 27 demands to the government, including an end to the 24-year state of emergency, and makes a thinly veiled reference to corruption among the ruling class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the king often appears at the royal kraal dressed traditionally in a cloak and feathers, he spends more time in his palaces with his six wives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is still liked by the majority of his subjects. Even the reformers only want his position to change from an absolute to constitutional monarch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been rumours that the king was not informed about the arrests before they occurred, that they were actually carried out by a couple of lackeys. But workers do not allow that to excuse the police shooting and wounding six strikers in Big Bend earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One striker unwrapped a piece of cloth to reveal empty cartridges. &quot;Do they look like rubber bullets?&quot; he asked, refuting police claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the federation's national executive members, Moses Bhembe, said he saw signs of compromise in the king. &quot;Last week he went to Pretoria to meet Mandela.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela is thought to have told the king that if he released the four, he need not worry about a boycott by South African trade unions. The king then offered the union leaders a deal where they would be released if they ended the strike, but they rejected it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With each successive strike violence has increased and now business leaders are worried that irretrievable damage will be inflicted upon the Swazi economy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka -Freedom of speech in Zambia suffered a severe blow with the imprisonment last week of Masautso Phiri, special projects editor of The Post, the country's only independent daily, and the separate arrest of three journalists for The Chronicle, an independent weekly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phiri was tried and sentenced by a full bench of the Supreme Court on a contempt of court charge for writing in his weekly satirical column - called &quot; My Post Card&quot; - that the state had secretly given seven judges R50-million to influence them to rule in favour of President Frederick Chiluba in a current petition challenging the legitimacy of his re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phiri apologised, saying that: &quot;In fact in brief statement, in the column, I did say I didn't believe the story, which shows that I hold the Supreme Court with respect.&quot; His lawyer, Sakwiba Sikota, asked the judges to consider fining Phiri, and proffered a published apology. &quot;A full and unreserved apology will be written as a Post Card column.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Matthew Chaila immediately said: &quot;Speaking for myself, I won't accept the apology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Chief Justice Bonaventure Bweupe rejected the apology, and the plea for a fine, saying: &quot;A fine would be inappropriate for the heinous and scandalous act. We award the accused a prison sentence of three months. This should be a lesson to others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Simpson, chairman of the local chapter of the regional watchdog for press freedom, the Media Institute of Southern Africa, said: &quot;In view of the fact that Mr Phiri admitted his error ... we would have preferred to see punishment take the form of a fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fred M'membe, editor-in-chief of The Post, in a hard-hitting editorial condemned the trial and sentence as hypocritical, saying: &quot;Phiri is a political victim of our judges. It is clearly politics at work and not law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M'membe noted that some people had, previously, accused the judges of worse crimes and got away with it. He said: &quot;Stewart Mwila accused Chief Justice Matthew Ngulube of rape; he got away with not even a night in a police cell ..  . This is the hypocrisy we are opposed to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several clergymen have agreed the action was a travesty of justice.  Archbishop John Mambo of the Church of God, said: &quot;You cannot have your accusers sitting in judgment. It's against the rules of natural justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Lweenod Hamusankwa, editor of The Chronicle, an independent weekly, was arrested last weekend with two of his reporters George Jambwa and Boyd Phiri, and charged with publishing &quot;information like to endanger the security of the nation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chronicle published a story saying a Zambian army armoury outside Lusaka had been broken into, and guns and ammunition had been stolen. When an opposition politician raised the issue in Parliament, deputy speaker Simon Mwila ordered the Defence Ministry to probe the matter. But police thought it more prudent to arrest The Chronicle journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trio were granted bail on Wednesday. Trial has been fixed for March 20.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maun - The Botswana government looks set to introduce &quot;wildlife-friendly fences&quot; - that control the movement of one species while allowing others to roam free - in the Okavango Delta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Kalikawe, a biologist for the Wildlife Training Institute based in Maun, produced a manual on such fences in 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says the idea is still at the planning stage, but that experiments could begin on the fence built last year west of the delta to control cattle lung disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is something new and even if it has worked somewhere else, it's different here,&quot; she says. &quot;Let's start with this one and see how it works.  Eventually it would be possible to change other existing fences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The options include using a &quot;roll-back fence&quot; (a fence that can literally be rolled back, allowing wildlife to pass through), leaving a gap underneath fences to allow smaller animals to get underneath and creating gaps at regular intervals. In addition, fences could be made more visible to animals to avoid surprise encounters and have in-built elasticity to avoid injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These options will be discussed at a February 27 meeting in Gaborone between representatives from the departments of animal health and wildlife, the National Conservation Strategy and conservation groups. - Okavango Observer</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire has agreed to peace talks with the growing rebel army in the east after he secretly dispatched a special envoy to seek South African mediation behind the back of his own government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela said he hoped the negotiations - the first of the five-month civil war - will take place in Cape Town this week. The announcement came after a summit of African leaders in the city to discuss the Zaire crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Representatives of the contesting parties have made a request that they would like to meet in South Africa ... to be able to discuss their problems,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela said South Africa would send a plane to collect the Zairean rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, from the Rwandan capital, Kigali. It was not revealed who will be negotiating on behalf of the Zairean government but diplomatic sources say the ground for the talks was laid by the arrival of Mobutu's special envoy in South Africa several days ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The envoy met Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to forward proposals for negotiations which were passed on to United States Vice- President Al Gore, who was visiting Cape Town. The two leaders contacted Kabila to encourage him to agree to talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela said South Africa will play host to the negotiations but he will not become personally involved unless he is asked. Although South African officials say the agenda will be built around a plan for a ceasefire and elections put forward by Uganda, the rebels have previously insisted that talks centre on Mobutu's resignation and the immediate formation of a new government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mobutu's envoy was in South Africa, the Zairean military stepped up pressure on the rebels with air raids against three towns in the east. But overall the government army has remained on the retreat despite launching what it promised would be a &quot;devastating&quot; counter-offensive last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack petered out in the face of stiff resistance by the rebels, who then continued their advances by seizing more towns and moving into the strategic, mineral-rich Shaba province. The rebels now control an area of eastern Zaire about 1 200km long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition parliamentarians, and even members of Mobutu's own party shaken by the rebel successes, added to the growing pressure on the Zairean leader to negotiate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement of the talks came after days of intense diplomatic pressure on the Zaireans. On Tuesday, the United Nations Security Council rushed through a peace plan for Zaire while a delegation of African foreign ministers flew to Kinshasa. The next day Mandela hosted a snap summit of other African leaders in Cape Town to discuss the Zaire crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A South African foreign ministry spokesman, Peter Swanepoel, described the promise of talks as the culmination of a series of initiatives by African nations to focus on negotiations rather than military intervention to contain the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of that is part of a more concerted African effort in trying to deal with the Great Lakes situation, not as an initiative on its own but parallel with other similar initiatives. There's been a very definite increase in the focus on the region,&quot; Swanepoel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu's initiative apparently came without the knowledge of his own government. Earlier this week his Cabinet ruled out negotiations. Only hours before Mandela's announcement, the foreign minister, Kamanda wa Kamanda, rejected the UN Security Council peace plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It called for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Zaire, including mercenaries. It also laid out plans for negotiations and elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a timid advance. We sincerely regret that this resolution does not condemn the aggressors. If the foreign troops do not pull out, we consider that there is no cessation of hostilities,&quot; Kamanda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire claims that Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi have invaded its territory in support of the rebels. The three governments deny involvement despite evidence that their soldiers crossed into Zaire at the beginning of the civil war five months ago and continue to assist the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mobutu is also relying on foreign forces, notably Serb mercenaries led by a Belgian commander. The Zairean leader has also acquired Russian-made fighter jets and helicopter gunships which flew air strikes against three towns in rebel-held areas this week. At least 21 people were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila denounced the air raids as &quot;terrorism&quot; and threatened retaliation. &quot; It is a criminal act by the decadent government in Kinshasa which, instead of attacking military targets, chose to bomb the civilian population,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Agricultural Research Council wants to recruit the nation's flies to help track down murderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council applied for R140 000 this week to study forensic entomology - the use of insects to investigate death, particularly of people whose bodies are found outdoors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was pitching, along with other science councils, for a portion of the R10-million set aside by the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology for research projects that will support the National Crime Prevention Strategy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Insects are the first to arrive at a corpse,&quot; the council said. &quot;This makes them fairly reliable indicators of time of death, as many have specific and known preferences for particular stages of decomposition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers said forensic entomology is a well-established science overseas, especially in the United States and Europe, where it is frequently used to investigate and solve serious crimes, particularly homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in South Africa, little attention has been paid to the science. This despite the fact that a large number of murders take place outdoors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Mervyn Mansell, specialist scientist in entomology at the council, noted that the Gauteng strangler's victims were killed on strips of veld or pieces of disused land and their bodies were often found days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mansell studies insects and what they do to plants. But he was drawn to the more macabre aspects of insect life when the police began approaching him for help in solving serious cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insects can tell more about death than the time it happened - they can show researchers whether poison was involved and where stab wounds are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mansell says certain flies congregate where there are lesions on the body.  And when they eat through human tissue, they ingest traces of chemicals like alcohol, poisons or metals, which collect in their bodies in a concentrated form. The chemicals show up when the flies are analysed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Different insects show up when a body is found in water, or burnt, or when the person dies of exposure, and all this needs to be documented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council wants the funding for a three- year project that will study the behaviour of insects in different scenarios, develop a forensic entomology handbook for the police and train entomologists in insect forensics so that they can assist police.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - You just cannot keep Peter Soller out of the headlines. The lawyer who made legal history when he successfully represented unmarried father Lawrie Fraser has been in the news again this week; this time facing criminal charges after Fraser's child was kidnapped from his adoptive parents in Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people in the South African legal profession regard Soller as a liability, a shyster lawyer hell-bent on publicity and bucking the system at all costs - including those borne by his clients. They cite his handling of the vagina acid burn case last year as a misguided insistence on going to the wire, even when the odds are clearly stacked against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result of this &quot;reckless pursuit&quot; of a multi-million rand judgment on behalf of Bernadette Gibson, who suffered severe burning at the hands of her negligent gynaecologist, was a supreme court award way below what had been offered in an out- of-court settlement. If only he had given her better advice, critics cry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their eyes, he has all the dignity of a nude at high noon on Jan Smuts Avenue; almost wanton in his indiscretions - giving out private information about the mental state of his clients and other intimate details. Imagine my surprise when within minutes of our meeting at his central Johannesburg office he handed out colour photographs of Gibson's burns, including a lurid shot of a catheter inserted into her vagina, as if they were holiday snaps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His explanation is that Gibson had given permission for them to be used as exhibits at the trial and they were thus a matter of public record. But I wonder if she expected them to be shoved into the faces of journalists discussing the case tangentially, several months on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high profile &quot;acid burn&quot; case was his public flogging and it still rankles. &quot;It aggrieves me a lot because she got a raw deal,&quot; he says, looking at me with dull eyes. &quot;It was a travesty of justice. How, and what right does a man (the judge) have to determine whether a woman has been damaged in this way ... I wonder how he would have felt if someone had poured acid over his private parts?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not an intellectual argument, but he declares it with passion.  Perhaps the same blind passion that leads him to make courtroom drama out of personal injuries cases; ask any judge and he will tell you emotional detachment is the prerequisite of a good lawyer. Soller, however, will not apologise for being &quot;too emotional&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having heard his reputation traduced privately and publicly by other lawyers, I was surprised to find the man much more affable than I had been led to believe; though he tries to mask it with a cynical hard-boiled image, one young female clerk insists &quot;he's a real softie&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 52 Soller looks like a man who has seen and experienced too much suffering. Every groove and line in his drooping face shrieks pain. His face is wan and polished by the diligence of hard circumstance. He appears to view the world through sad eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the phenomenal success of his constitutional battle for Fraser (the court ruled that biological fathers should have rights in adoption cases), he seems unable to believe that once again his hard work and perseverance have paid off. It is as if he always expects to come off a loser and his mind has been programmed to expect nothing else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people are able, over the years, to build up a fairly secure resistance to emotional pain. But Soller has never been able to; no sooner has a nip of someone's suffering hit his senses than the emotional hangover begins. It is a real handicap for a lawyer who revels in taking on lost causes, inevitably pitting him against commercial giants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was that when he took on the 1992 inquest into contaminated hospital drips which allegedly killed about 120 babies, Soller says he came up against the powerful lobby of two major banks representing the manufacturing company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These banks were also my corporate clients. They called me in and warned that I would lose business unless I walked away.&quot; Head tilted back and eyes narrow in confidentiality, he rattles off the banks' names declaring he did not &quot;give a continental stuff&quot; if they sued for libel ... but this newspaper does, so I'll leave them out of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soller, who had about 80 people (he is vague about the numbers) working in his partnership at the time, said he discovered the drips were not being manufactured under strict protocol. But the magistrate refused to let him lead with this information. &quot;Without this evidence I could not win the case,&quot; he says bitterly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not his only loss. The banks withdrew their business, his firm went bust and he became insolvent; then the car went, the house was auctioned and pretty soon his wife skipped town with another woman. &quot;She was looking for an excuse to leave and this was it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pain was all the greater because after only two years of marriage she took their young son with her. Soller has three other children by his first wife, but the toddler was his pride and joy. He was to spend nearly a year searching for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I had a friend who lent me money to fly to Cape Town virtually every weekend, until one day quite by accident I spotted her car and followed it.&quot; At this point his voice quivers with the memory: &quot;Domestic troubles are the most destructive in life. I want to cry when I think of those times.&quot; This incident may offer an insight into his decision to fight Fraser's claim for parental rights without pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, for a man who likes to specialise in medical cases, Soller met his ex-wife (a nurse) while recuperating at the Morningside Clinic, after a 10-minute liver biopsy landed him in intensive care. The surgeon had punctured his lungs. Did he sue? &quot;No. It was my friend. We grew up together and he was very apologetic.&quot; He is now suing the doctor on behalf of a client who had surgery for sweaty hands and left hospital eight month later after his oesophagus was ruptured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soller had wanted to be a doctor and got good grades from King Edward School, but his father - a Jewish immigrant from the East End of London who made a modest living in the rag trade - could not afford to put him through medical school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He switched to law, working as an articled clerk by day, then attending Wits University's law school by night. But his office bookshelves buckling under weighty medical textbooks are a testament of his continued interest in medicine, as are his love of watching operations and autopsies. Freudians may say he takes on medical malpractice cases to compensate for not becoming a doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says it's a duty. &quot;I see the suffering of human life and I try to address injustices as best I can. Most of these people come to me with no money because they were told I would not give up. And I won't.&quot; Even if, inevitably, he knows there is no fee forthcoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today Soller shares a practice, partly bankrolled three years ago by the loyal client who lent him money to search for his son, which employs eight people. It has been a long haul from the stigma of insolvency and a period of depression - only kept at bay by Prozac and sleeping pills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually the bar council declared him a &quot;fit and proper person&quot; to resume his practice, but some advocates still refused to work for him unless paid upfront. &quot;It takes a long time to get back on the financial ladder. I'm still not making money beyond what is needed for the firm because I have no corporate clients, only people who come off the street or are recommended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things are, however, looking better for Soller, who lives in a house off Louis Botha - another lifeline from the loyal client. He is planning to open a small office in Cape Town to allow more frequent contact with his son who is now seven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not a man who knows how to go belly-up. Whether he likes it or not, and I suspect he does, his true metier will continue to be representing lost causes. &quot;Life is sad, but interesting. I make no apologies for caring.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Skilled foreigners should be lured to South Africa to fill the gap left by the brain drain, according to research for an influential government task team on immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social scientist Robin Cohen says official statistics have not adequately reflected the exodus of professionals with valuable skills from South Africa, and the education system is not up to the task of quickly replacing those leaving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer lies in aggressively recruiting professionals such as doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers and accountants from overseas, Cohen says, and tracking down emigres and persuading them to come home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen will make his submission to the Home Affairs-appointed task team next week. He is said to have the support of several members of the task team. The team's recommendations, due before the Cabinet by mid-year, will be included in a Green Paper which is expected to shake-up current immigration and emigration laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Statistical Service (CSS) says that almost 8 000 people emigrated between January and September last year, with only 3307 immigrants coming in. According to the CSS, 34% of emigrants are teachers, 29% engineers, 24% accountants and 13% in the medical professions, leaving professional gaps behind them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen says the CSS statistics are way below actual figures of emigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If one combines data from training centres ... from destination country immigration statistics and from data on 'tourism', it is evident that a large number of intending and potential emigrants are not tabulated,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the under-recorded data show that there is a large deficit in the number of economically active people arriving compared with the number leaving. Thus, although there seems to be only a small net loss of migrants, this statistic is more serious when we consider that nearly two- thirds of immigrants are declared not to be economically active.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen also suggests building a data bank of all skilled South Africans so that their knowledge and expertise can be harnessed in development projects around the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - While the Constitution promotes human rights, churches refuse to accept gays and lesbians into the South African clergy. Gustav Thiel reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE religious fraternity is on a collision course with the Constitution over its continued ban on homosexuals. Constitutional and human rights law specialists say the Bill of Rights, formally adopted earlier this month, provides powerful ammunition for a Constitutional Court challenge to churches who refuse to accept gays and lesbians into the clergy or into their congregations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A string of mainstream churches told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week that whatever is written in the Constitition, it does not take the place of the Bible, and in keeping with their interpretation of the Scriptures, they would keep their doors closed to the gay community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has yet to be a test case, however, and it remains to be seen how far the state is prepared to go to enforce the the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The general worldwide trend is not to allow government to dictate to churches,&quot; says Wits University law lecturer and human rights specialist Tsepho Mosikatsana, &quot;but our Constitution goes further than any other in that the spirit of equality in it would prohibit churches from excluding gays and lesbians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find a great deal of support in this document for the fact that churches may no longer exclude homosexuals from becoming members or even clergy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution, which took effect earlier this month, opposes discrimination on the basis of &quot;race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill of Rights requires that national legislation be enacted to prohibit unfair discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Methodist church said it had no official policy excluding gays, but did not allow gay clergy. Spokeswoman Vivian Harris said the church would decide on the issue, but no early change in its stance was expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Dutch Reformed church said that &quot;homosexuality should always be seen as a deviant form of sexuality in the light of the scripture&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potschefstroom University dean of theology Dries du Plooy said: &quot;The Bible states explicitly that homosexual behaviour is a sin and that it should therefore not be tolerated by the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will never discard any homosexuals without trying to submit them to pastoral guidance, but I cannot envisage a time when my church will change its stance on the issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of the Anglican and Catholic churches refused to comment before further consultation within their &quot;proper structures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhema church spokesman Ron Steele said: &quot;We do not discriminate on the basis of race, creed or gender on who enters our church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, when it comes to holding office in any part of the ministry, the moral teachings of the Bible guide all appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore a gay person who is practising the lifestyle would disqualify him or herself from holding office in our organisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town constitutional lawyer Anton Katz said churches could &quot;probably&quot; be prohibited from turning away homosexuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he added, it would be &quot;tough to argue that churches could be forced by the Constitution to allow homosexual people to act as clergy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the very least I would argue the issue will spark a lot of debate in the near future and that it will be tested in the Constitutional Court,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Struggle To Be 'Normal' Christians</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gustav Thiel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWICE every Sunday the congregation of the Deo Gloria church gathers in Pretoria to worship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the church prefer not to disclose where they meet, except that it is in another church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They represent many deminations, coming together in the belief that the Bible should be the focus of their worship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What they also have in common is a belief that sexual preference should not get in the way of religious worship. About 80% of the 200-strong congregation is gay or lesbian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been impossible to function within traditional churches,&quot; Deo Gloria's &quot;pastor&quot; Sue Welman says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My feeling now is that we can change perceptions from within the so-called gay churches and in the end reconcile all Christians, which is our ultimate aim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welman is speaking from her home in Centurion, which she shares with partner Diane Bennett whom she hopes to marry &quot;as soon as this becomes legal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She doesn't want to say more about Deo Gloria's members, or about where they meet because &quot;there is always a threat that we may be attacked&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she says she founded Deo Gloria - one of an estimated 20 gay churches in South Africa - after she realised that there was nowhere else for her to go - the only other alternative for a gay Christian was to &quot;go straight and masturbate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welman (32) was born and raised in Bloemfontein's &quot;ultra conservative&quot; environment, the daughter of a preacher in the Evangelical Reformed church where her mother played the organ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I knew from birth I was gay, but living in that society made it impossible to confront it publicly,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was only when I was 18 while at Bible school in Cape Town that I had the courage to come out. The result of this decision was that I got kicked out of Bible school and thus a long journey started for me to find a home in the church.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She went on to study religion at the University of Port Elizabeth before joining the Anglican church, which she quit two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until Deo Gloria was established two years ago, Pretoria's gay worshippers had to drive to one of four gay churches in Johannesburg. When the church opened, word spread quickly. Welman says Deo Gloria has also managed to attract heterosexual congregation members who &quot;find the atmosphere more conducive to the worshipping of God&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though she has received anonymous threats, Welman says the attitude of the public generally, and of the traditional church establishment, has been one of respect. This does not, however, &quot;extend to allowing us in their fold and condoning our natural sexuality&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether that will change under the new Constitution looks unlikely. &quot;We were hoping that when it was adopted our struggles would be a thing of the past,&quot; Welman says. &quot;But we find that document is still just a piece of paper which does not guarantee gays the right to belong to churches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until it does, Welman is resigned to continuing her fight for recognition not only against traditionalist religion but also against traditionalist society. She has filed a lawsuit against life insurance company Southern Life, for example, because the company refuses to share her partner's medical aid benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just another struggle which we've had to face and will win in the end,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What people often fail to see is that homosexuals do not seek the limelight but that notoriety often becomes necessary for us to achieve our ultimate goal which is to be accepted as normal members of society,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The government wants to weed out traditional leaders who were placed in their communities by the old apartheid regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Constitutional Development is planning an investigation into the background of South Africa's nearly 800 royals, which would include tracing family trees to try to determine which leaders are legitimate and which were planted for political purposes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the National Party government was in power, it was not uncommon for government officials to play &quot;king-maker&quot;, influencing the succession of traditional leaders, particularly in politically sensitive areas, as a means to control rural politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department has no record of how many kings were actually made in the country, but it is understood the government pays nearly R150-million a year in salaries for traditional leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Sizani, departmental chief director of traditional affairs, said the investigation is part of a programme to enhance the role of traditional leaders, whose power has been stripped by the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the drafting of our Constitution, there was a gap between the experience of the African people and the Western norms,&quot; Sizani said. &quot;I see here an opportunity to bring a fusion of these.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme will also seek to regulate royals' salaries, which vary widely from province to province. For example, the North-West provincial government pays its chiefs R60 000 a year, while the Free State pays the relatively niggardly sum of R2 400 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some cynics suggest the department wants to centralise the payments as a means to control political agendas. But Sizani said decisions on salaries would be made only after recent recommendations by the Steyn Commission have been thoroughly examined by the new Council of Traditional Leaders, as well as other institutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The SABC has axed a string of high-profile sports commentators just days before a huge sports programme relaunch, in favour of veteran presenter Martin Locke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Topsport general manager Edward Griffiths said this week eight presenters are to go. They include athletics presenter Elma Neethling, the first female to conquer the all-male domain of sports anchoring; Pieter van den Berg, a Topsport stalwart who has been with the station since its inception; soccer commentator Abe Metsileng; live studio commentator Paul Freathy; cricket commentator Vuyo Mbuli; Ursula Stapelfedt; Strydom Sigila; and all-round commentator Michael Abrahamson.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffiths said the eight could still be used on a freelance basis, but none had been chosen to host the 12 new sport shows the SABC is to launch next month, or to act as live sports anchors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locke, meanwhile, has landed the prime slot: he will be presenting a new Saturday afternoon Topsport programme starting on March 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffiths said Locke was chosen because he is a &quot;professional and is the only person who is qualified to handle such a complex programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We used to have a rota system where we used to alternate presenters and always boast a different face,&quot; Griffiths added. &quot;Now, with the changes happening in Topsport, I want a single presenter to give each show a branding if you like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to distinguish between contract and freelancing. All we are saying is that we are now only going to pay each presenter for the show he hosts. Before, everyone was being paid even though they only worked maybe once a month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An anonymous fax sent to the Mail &amp; Guardian and signed &quot;SABC Topsport anchors&quot; accuses Griffiths of favouritism toward Locke, claiming he &quot;thinks the sun shines out of Martin Locke&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fax alleges that Griffiths's decisions are unilateral and based on &quot; personal preferences&quot;, ignoring even the choices of the eight executive producers in the Topsport division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Griffiths denied this. He said he has always had an &quot;open door policy&quot; and dissatisfied staffers are free to approach him.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An advocate disbarred for cheating is forgiven because of 'extraordinary circumstances' in the closing days of apartheid. Mungo Soggot reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Pretoria advocate who was disbarred for cheating former defence minister Magnus Malan by charging him exorbitant legal fees has been reinstated by a trio of Pretoria judges including Transvaal Judge President Frikkie Eloff - the man responsible for expelling the advocate in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schalk Burger billed Malan for work he did not do while representing Malan and the former South African Defence Force (SADF) in a civil claim in 1991.  The claim had been lodged by disgruntled members of the Civilian Co-operation Bureau, the covert death squad, who said they had not been paid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Pretoria Bar Council determined that Burger had defrauded Malan to the tune of hundreds of thousands of rand, it refused to take the matter to court. Then- Bar Council chairman Brian Southwood, SC - now a judge - was subsequently ousted, and the General Council of the Bar stepped in to take the case to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eloff ruled that a mere suspension was too light a punishment for Burger, who had not only overcharged Malan and the SADF but had also accused the General Council of the Bar of pursuing a vendetta against him. Burger was found to be guilty of &quot;unprofessional behaviour&quot; that included an &quot;element of dishonesty and fraud&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the inquiry, Burger sought to justify his behaviour by saying he had been privy to information that could rock the government and bring about Malan's downfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pretoria Supreme Court's judgment last December, which was made available only this week, exonerates Burger by arguing he has now paid the price for his errant behaviour, and by claiming his behaviour was influenced by the &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; of the time - apparently a reference to the paranoia that gripped South Africa in the closing days of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malcolm Wallis, chairman of the General Council of the Bar, which opposed Burger's readmission, said it would be inappropriate to comment on the court's decision as the Bar was involved: &quot;After careful debate, we have decided not to pursue the matter any further.&quot; Some in legal circles have expressed surprise that the full Bench of the Pretoria court which heard the case did not include any judges from Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment was delivered by Transvaal Deputy Judge President Piet van der Walt, and backed by both Eloff and Judge van Dyk. Van der Walt said Burger was forced off the straight and narrow by a &quot;combination of circumstances in an extraordinary time in our land's history ... I think he has learned his lesson.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Burger suffered no permanent character defect and understood how he had erred. When assessing why Burger did not apologise spontaneously to the General Council of the Bar and to those colleagues in-volved in the investigation, the judge said he sympathised with Burger's explanation that he had been &quot;ashamed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said shame was a feeling that is well understood, and that if someone caused offence and understood the damage he had done to himself and the profession it was understandable he would be ashamed to look his accusers in the eye. &quot;It is an honest answer,&quot; the judge said. &quot;A person is a complex thing, a personality is a complex thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Council's advocate, Jeremy Gauntlett, SC, told the court Burger had libelled his colleagues involved in the probe. The council contended it was not convinced of Burger's rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burger's advocate, Sam Maritz, SC, said his client had &quot;suffered enough&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Walt said it appeared Burger had developed a &quot;big head&quot; working for a client like Malan, which helped explain his &quot;mistake&quot;. Burger was &quot;overly impressed by the fact he had clients such as Malan and he was their confidant&quot; . The court cited the fact that Burger had even installed a fax machine in his house, to remain close to his treasured client.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court was sure the public would be protected against such an offence if the applicant was allowed back to Bar, Van der Walt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to be readmitted, Burger relinquished his senior counsel status.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The medical fraternity, still battling with its conscience over the recent advent of legalised abortion in South Africa, will soon have a new medical and ethical dilemma to confront, with the release of proposals to consider legalising euthanasia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Law Commission is preparing a discussion document for release later this month that will include the pros and cons of active euthanasia - in which a doctor acts deliberately to cause the death of an already dying patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal Court Judge Pierre Olivier, who is chairing the investigation for the commission, said it is too early to speculate on legislation that may emerge from the discussion document. &quot;We want the discussion to be as broad as possible,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that meant, he said, that it would address the issue of active euthanasia. He said it would go so far as to suggest that South Africa consider following the lead of the Netherlands and Australia's Northern Territory, where doctors can legally speed the dying to their end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those already involved in the debate predicted that Parliament is likely to enact legislation legalising what is commonly known as passive euthanasia, defined as withdrawing life support, or withholding life-saving treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trudie Stohr of the Living Will Society said passive euthanasia should be legalised because it is already common practise, a fact that she said should be recognised by the commission and the legislators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent survey by the Medical Association of South Africa found that a surprising 12% of doctors who responded said they had actively helped terminally ill patients to die, which is essentially euthanasia, even though it is currently illegal and presumably a violation of the profession's own Hippocratic Oath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But though the practice may exist already, medical and legal professionals predict that the report of the commission and any legislation that comes out of it will elicit strong responses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Selma Browde, a leading specialist in the field who made a submission to the commission, said she hoped that the discussion document would draw a clear distinction between palliative medicine and euthanasia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Legal clarification is necessary to get away from old definitions and formulate new ones so that doctors, nurses and the public will no longer be confused about their legal and moral duty to relieve pain and other distressing symptoms,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the problem, she said, is that the term euthanasia has often been used for situations to which it did not apply, and there has been confusion in the use of the terms passive and active.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, she said, passive euthanasia is a term that should no longer be used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And palliative medicine, she says, is none of the above. She defines palliative medicine as providing for the medical and nursing needs of a patient for whom cure is no longer possible, and for all the psychological, social and spiritual needs of the patient and family for the duration of the illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The confusion stems to some extent from fear on the part of medical professionals that by giving a patient medicine to relieve pain they may end up shortening the life of the patient, which could be regarded as a form of euthanasia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The principle, which is known as the &quot;double effect&quot;, needs to be clarified and such fears put to rest, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The distinction between giving pain relief that ends up shortening a patient's life, and euthanasia, she says, is &quot;intention&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In euthanasia the intention is to terminate life, but when the intention is to relieve the suffering of a dying patient and the secondary effect is the possible hastening of the moment of death it becomes known as the secondary effect and is no longer euthanasia but palliative medicine,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission members privately say the outcome of the discussions after the document is released will create &quot;quite a stir&quot; but say legislation is needed to provide legal certainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Medical Association's survey of 1400 doctors, of whom about a third responded, found that while 12% of respondents had actively helped terminally ill patients to die, nearly 60% had performed &quot;passive&quot; euthanasia and 9% had participated in physician-assisted suicide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The head of Durban's port is accused of racist behaviour and using spy tactics against his fired deputy, reports Ann Eveleth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE head of South Africa's busiest port is bugging the offices of his subordinates, undermining black empowerment and operating behind the backs of senior port management, according to allegations by port employees and suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employees at the Durban port say that manager Bax Nomvete is engaged in a witch- hunt against former associates of Sipho Nyawo, the deputy port manager who was fired last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portnet, which operates the port, fired Nyawo because of alleged credit card irregularities, but his supporters say he was unfairly targeted by what they call the racist old guard at Transnet, the parastatal that owns Portnet.  The allegations were rejected by Transnet chairman Louise Tager.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disgruntled employees also say they have come under surveillance and investigation because of their support for Nyawo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said a new Transnet operation, the Business Information Services Department, is involved in the surveillance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And according to documents in the Mail &amp; Guardian's possession, Portnet senior management have questioned Nomvete about the role of the new department, and his relationship to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a January 29 memo, Portnet chief executive Ivor Funnel asked Nomvete to explain a visit to the port by department head Felix Ngwenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why were I and the office of the executive manager (security and risk management) not informed of the visit?&quot; the memo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete replied to Funnel that it had been &quot;to gain a better understanding of any security and risk-related problems that could compromise our ability to run an effective service&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete was unable to define the actual role of the new department, though he confirmed that he had discussed &quot;security related matters&quot; with Ngwenya.  He denied he had any employees placed under surveillance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funnell could not be reached this week and Ngwenya refused to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Nomvete has also come under fire from Portnet suppliers whose contracts he cancelled last year. Joining together as the Black Economic Empowerment Committee, they say they have suffered &quot;humiliation, financial loss and many other negative consequences&quot; because of allegations at the time that the contracts were cancelled because of procurement irregularities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete told the M&amp;G he would reinstate the contracts &quot;fairly soon&quot;, but added this would happen &quot;along terms and conditions more conducive to a fair and transparent business environment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portnet insiders say that the allegations were false, and there had never been a problem with their service. They say Nomvete cancelled the contracts because they had been signed during Nyawo's tenure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under pressure from Transnet managing director Saki Macozoma and the Department of Public Enterprises, Nomvete reportedly has promised to reinstate the contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete said he cancelled the contracts because they did not comply with Transnet's tender procedures. &quot;While we support black empowerment, we are not a charity so our businesses must provide a quality service,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision also was linked to the suspension last year of six Portnet employees - most from the procurement section - pending investigation by Transnet's audit department. Department head Nigel Payne this week denied the two actions were linked, but according to a fax from Payne to Nomvete dated November 5 Payne actually instructed Nomvete to cancel the contracts. He told him to give &quot;30 days' notice ... in terms of the contracts entered into between Portnet and the approximately 20 companies affected in Durban&quot; and &quot; to put in place a system to evaluate the current 'contractors' during the notice period&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The law requiring members of Parliament to declare their assets and financial interests and extra-parliamentary income may be well- meaning but it is nearly impossible to uphold, according to the person responsible for administering the register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting registrar of members' interests, Peter Lilienfeld, said that without funds to hire investigators to check out MPs' disclosure statements, he has had no option but to trust that MPs will disclose their financial interests.  Lilienfeld also called on the public to report inaccuracies in their MPs' statements to Parliament.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G discovered some discrepancies in the information supplied by an MP in May last year, but was unable to determine whether the missing information had been deliberately withheld or disclosed confidentially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Register of Members' Interests has three sections: one for public disclosure, one dealing with employment outside Parliament and a confidential section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So while some MPs have listed their properties - some even gave addresses - in the public section of the register, others appear to have chosen to list them confidentially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the M&amp;G ascertained last September that NP MP Abe Williams owned 11 properties in the Western Cape. He listed three in the public register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lilienfeld said it was possible that Williams had listed the remaining eight properties in the confidential section of the register, but he was not at liberty to confirm this. The same could go for African National Congress MP Winnie Mandela, who was named in court by a bank as the bond- holder for a property in Soweto that she did not disclose in the part of the register available to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The confidential part of the register is only open to myself and the parliamentary committee on members' interests,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The code can be reviewed and changed ... It has to be seen as a massive first step. I cannot go out and investigate whether a person has more properties than has been disclosed unless I receive a complaint from the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lilienfeld said he had noted the disclosure by Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu that he held shares in a publishing company that produces educational material, but would not take further steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He complied with the code by declaring that he owned the shares. He will only be required to cede ownership if someone complains. It is not up to the registrar to be pro-active and search in advance for conflicts of interests,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole system is based on good faith, not on the registrar releasing information about members of Parliament to the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs are required to list all gifts in the public section of the register.  Although only two MPs had disclosed that they had been given cellphones as gifts, the M&amp;G has ascertained that at least eight more have received them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; The M&amp;G reported last week that deputy speaker Baleka Kgotsitsile listed the total value of her gifts, including a Technics CD player, at less than R350. She pointed out this week that what she had said in her statement was that none of the individual gifts was valued at more than R350.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Free State African National Congress member who has launched a court challenge to the organisation's decision to nominate Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri as premier for the province is still trying to unearth who made the original nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC last year successfully challenged Edmund Qhali's bid for urgent relief in the Free State Supreme Court, but no decision has yet been made on the merits of his application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qhali has asked the court to overturn the decision, claiming &quot;transparency, democracy and justice ... was miscarried when Terror Lekota was removed from the premiership for having taken a firm and credible stand against corruption.  &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No date has yet been set for the supreme court hearing, but Qhali's lawyer and the ANC's legal representatives are exchanging information in preparation for the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ANC's response to Qhali's urgent interdict last year, the organisation annexed minutes of a meeting in Welkom on December 1 attended by branch executive members and a task group led by Labour Minister Tito Mboweni which was sent to the province to restore political order. Members were attempting to discover who nominated Matsepe-Casaburri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minutes read: &quot;Comrades questioned the lack of consultation by the caretaker committee and wanted to know where Comrade Ivy had been identified as a premier candidate for the Free State. They also questioned at what meeting the national executive committee had decided that she would be the only candidate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doubts about Matsepe-Casaburri's popularity in the province were reinforced last weekend, as she lost out to Zingile Dingani as the organisation's provincial chair. Dingane and most of the others elected to the senior posts in the new regional executive committee are Lekota sympathisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party insiders said Dingane's election was a clear message from the province's members to their national leadership, which had encouraged them to elect Matsepe-Casaburri as chair, that they were unhappy with its meddling in provincial affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A newly elected member of the Free State ANC provincial executive committee said Qhali's case was supported by a &quot;significant&quot; number of branches. Some members are committed to helping finance his court battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC did not respond to questions about whether it would provide Qhali's lawyers with the minutes they are seeking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Dolphin Group which has secured huge interests to develop tourism in Mpumalanga is struggling to defend its chief, reports Justin Arenstein</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE public relations drive by nature reserve heavyweight Dolphin Group stumbled this week after Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi's office denied it had issued letters vindicating Dolphin chief Ketan Somaia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supposed letter was used by the Mpumalanga Parks Board - which has cut a deal giving Dolphin exclusive rights to prime nature reserves in the province - to dismiss concerns regarding Somaia's business dealings in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia's South African lawyers have previously used two other letters from Kenya supposedly vindicating Somaia to try to head off M&amp;G articles on Dolphin and Somaia. The validity of both of these letters is now also in question.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia did, however, concede this week that consultation over Dolphin's deal - which gives it exclusive commercial development rights to reserves including the Blyde River Canyon for 50 years - should have been better handled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal has outraged rural communities, conservationists and land claim activists, who say affected communities have still not been consulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia said he planned a series of presentations for local communities, and that he was prepared to revise Dolphin's contract with the board &quot;in the interests of affected communities, the deal itself and South Africa at large&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns about Somaia's past business dealings include allegations that he was involved in a defaulted R35-million arms contract with the Kenyan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga Parks Board chief Alan Gray said earlier this month that the letter from Moi cleared Somaia of involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kenya's high commissioner to South Africa, Justice Mudavadi, said Gray's claim about the letter was &quot;very strange and surprising&quot;, and that Moi would never address another country's officials directly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Protocol demands that my president would only write a letter to his counterpart, President Mandela, and not someone who is a relatively junior official - especially without informing my office. I know of no such letter and find this whole thing very strange and surprising,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repeated requests this week to Gray for copies of the alleged letter and comment from the board on the Kenyan denial were unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Somaia, who was in Johannesburg this week spearheading Dolphin's public relations roadshow, also refuted the existence of the letter, saying that Moi would have no motivation for writing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia however reiterated that he was innocent of any wrongdoing in Kenya, where he has declined at least three formal requests to testify about the R35- million contract before Kenya's Public Accounts Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was linked to the two London companies which had defaulted on the contract and that he still served as their commissioned agent in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I am not a director or shareholder in either company. I decided not to testify because the formalities of finally delivering on the contract had begun and I therefore felt that there was no need for me to appear before the Public Accounts Committee,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee tabled a recommendation before the Kenyan Parliament last month calling for the government not to enter into any further contracts or agreements with Somaia or any companies associated with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Committee chairman Michael Wamalwa wrote to Somaia's South African lawyers on December 3 stating that the Kenyan billionaire no longer needed to testify.  In a second letter, dated January 17, Wamalwa said Somaia had helped the government recover 80% of the outstanding order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both letters were used by lawyers Cliffe Decker and Todd, to pre-empt articles the M&amp;G planned to publish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other committee members however have denied the validity of Wamalwa's letters. Committee member Martin Chikuku said Wamalwa had been forced to apologise publicly for issuing the letters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were shocked to hear that a letter absolving Somaia had been issued, because there is no way that he has been cleared,&quot; he told the M&amp;G.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The committee firmly believes that Somaia directly benefited from this episode because if a man has no interest or ownership in a company, then how can he force them to suddenly - after seven years - begin honouring their contracts?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wamalwa's election campaign coalition partners, the Democracy Party, also publicly cut ties with him last week after the apology, but retained their links with his party, Ford Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moolman Mentz, a member of the Mpumalanga legislature team which recently returned from a tour of Dolphin's businesses in Kenya and Dubai, said he had quizzed Somaia and was satisfied with his explanations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa is not for sissies,&quot; Mentz said. &quot;In any case, if you look at the amounts involved, then the alleged misappropriation is like a drop of water in the sea compared to the Kenyan economy - or even the Dolphin economy. All businessmen have at least some deals that go sour and some that work out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mentz said current negative publicity about Somaia and Dolphin were not in the province's interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a fallacy to think the Mpumalanga government will ever subject investors to tender processes or in-depth investigations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we create the perception that investors will be investigated in this manner, it is doubtful that (we) will attract any investors at all,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The view from her back door is of acres and acres of corrugated steel roofs, weighted down by cement blocks and broken furniture.  Thin columns of smoke rise from fires burning in steel drums. All around her, the streets are teeming with people, cars and a small herd of goats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The environment, says Nompumelelo, a 28- year-old Wits University student who asked that her surname not be used, is &quot;not conducive to studying&quot;. But it is where she will return next week when she leaves her student residence hall in Parktown. Earlier this month, Nompumelelo lost a bursary from the Institute for Race Relations after changing her course of study to a field not covered by the institute's bursary program. She had depended upon it for three years to pay for tuition and accommodation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With two semesters to go to a degree in industrial sociology, Nompumelelo has learned first-hand what thousands of South Africa students know: without financial support, university is prohibitively expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the R28 it costs weekly to travel from Alexandra to Wits is more than her mother can afford on a R400 per month pension. The thousands of rands per semester she needs for residence and tuition is out of the question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has been fighting all her life for a brighter future for herself and her 10- year-old daughter. She learned five languages. She worked a string of jobs from clerk to field worker. With the encouragement of teachers and her mother she kept plugging away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She still has options. She could try to find another bursary, or work to pay her fees. In the past Nompumelelo also could have counted on a government- funded student loan. But with large-scale cuts in funding for higher education looming, that may not be possible. It is a situation that thousands of needy students face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Finance Ministry's 1997 preliminary budget figures call for cuts in student loans from R300-million to R250-million. Education officials hope they can find more money before the budget is finalised, but as the figures stand, the number of students who receive assistance could drop from 60 000 this year to 45 000 next year, said Roy Jackson, the chief executive officer of the Tertiary Education Fund of South Africa, which administers the loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Students Congress (Sasco) has announced plans for nationwide demonstrations in the coming weeks, partly in response to the funding crisis. Sasco leaders say the government is discriminating against poor students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cuts will have the greatest affect on institutions that traditionally served disadvantaged students, most of whom depended on some degree of financial aid. For example, Peninsular Technikon in Cape Town will see the largest cuts in the country. It received R12,4-million in 1996 for student loans; should the preliminary 1997 figures hold, Pentech will receive R7,9- million, a 36% reduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, institutions which used to have a predominantly white student body expect fewer cuts as more previously disadvantaged students enrol. At Wits, more than 2 000 undergraduate students received about R13- million in government loans in the 1996 budget year. Preliminary figures showed that amount could be cut to R9,2-million in the 1997 budget year, which would make for a 29% cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Always in the past, if a student proves to us he is needy, we could provide the money,&quot; said Liz Fick, the senior assistant registrar for financial aid and scholarships at Wits. &quot;Now, unless the government comes up with more money, we may not be able to meet the needs of all students.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lincoln Mali, spokesman for Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu, said the minister was &quot;optimistic&quot; that greater funding could be secured, but Mali offered no information on negotiations under way. &quot;There is a phase in which these matters must remain confidential,&quot; he said. &quot;We can only engage the public when these figures are finalised.&quot; Figures for 1997 education funding could be released next week, said Mali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From her home in crowded Alexandra Nompumelelo will be anxiously awaiting their decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Colleagues of Professor Sam Nolutshungu, the United States- based academic who turned down the vice-chancellorship at Wits University, say he used the Wits offer to land himself a better job with his current employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also say Nolutshungu, who rejected the Wits post at the 11th hour for &quot; health reasons&quot;, is not ill and acknowledged this to them at a staff meeting earlier this year. When asked if he was ill he replied &quot;of course not&quot;, adding he had to find some explanation for the South Africans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nolutshungu has now quit as acting director of the University of Rochester's Frederick Douglass Institute to take up a full-time post with the university's political science department. In negotiating his new position, he secured a package that includes generous research funding and leave arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Frederick Douglass Institute - named for an escaped slave, abolitionist, orator and newspaper founder in Rochester - specialises in African American studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colleagues in Rochester expressed outrage this week at Nolutshungu's actions, saying he used the Wits offer as a bargaining chip to secure the post at the political science faculty, leaving the institute in the lurch. &quot; They (Wits) got jilted. We got divorced,&quot; said a colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nolutshungu won Wits over last October with a smooth public presentation, beating rival candidates June Sinclair, a Wits law professor, and Njabulo Ndebele of the University of the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But colleagues say Nolutshungu was vague about the Wits offer, leaving them to track his progress by reading the local press which on January 15 reported Nolutshungu had turned down the offer. That was two days after Nolutshungu shocked Wits with his faxed note regretting that he could not take up the position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nolutshungu's decision means Wits will have to undergo yet another lengthy selection process to find a successor to Robert Charlton, who steps down at the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One colleague, who declined to be named, said Nolutshungu had done a &quot;grave disservice&quot; to the institute by secretly negotiating a better package with the university without considering the institute's interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another colleague said Nolutshungu's move now threatens to undermine the institute. He apparently looked out exclusively for his own interests when negotiating with the dean, and did not broach the issue of the institute's budget. Colleagues say that he could have pushed to have the institute's budget kept at a level that would allow it to replace him with someone of equal stature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One colleague said that when Nolutshungu was confronted about his failure to lobby for the institute in his negotitations, he replied he had not mentioned it as this would have weakened his chances of getting the new package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another said his approach was particularly inappropriate because Nolutshungu's primary responsibility as the institute's acting director for the past two years, was to negotiate on its behalf with the university in a &quot; tough environment with inadequate finances&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Mail &amp; Guardian has learned that Wits never contacted the institute to inquire about Nolutshungu's skill at administration which, according to colleagues, is not his forte. &quot;He is uninterested in administration, and nobody ever contacted us to ask about it,&quot; said one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nolutshungu again failed to respond to the M&amp;G.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Protesting students have accused Njabulo Ndebele of being slow to implement changes on the campus, writes Tangeni Amupadhi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE same forces who proclaimed University of the North Vice-Chancellor Njabulo Ndebele champion of transformation in tertiary education, have turned against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndebele - who lost out in the three-way competition for the top job at Wits University - has been accused by academic colleagues, students and workers of impeding transformation on the Turfloop campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long-threatening row exploded this week with protest marches and uproar on campus. Chanting students tried to stop course registration and disrupted a meeting of university top management, insisting that they be allowed to hand a petition to Ndebele in person.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the petition, they demanded an overhaul of university management and an agreement by the university to register even those students who owe the university money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Student protestors accused the university of not doing enough to repeal its apartheid-era Act. They complained that the university transformation committee has failed to meet monthly as they are supposed to, and they said that the university senate is dominated by &quot;conservative Afrikaners&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Allied Structures, which represents a range of academics, students and staff, has also accused Ndebele and his cabinet, which is known as the executive management committee, of making &quot;retrogressive changes&quot; and of stagnating transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian could not reach Ndebele for comment. University spokesman John Wiltshire, while acknowledging there &quot;are huge management problems&quot;, dismissed most of the allegations as unsubstantiated and malicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rhetoric is so easy,&quot; he said. &quot;What do they mean by transformation? What more do they want us to do? We are the most democratic tertiary institution in the country. We began transforming a long time ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allied Structures this week demanded the disbandment of the university management committee, saying that Ndebele has filled it with his preferred candidates, instead of his deputies and the university registrar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiltshire conceded that many of the members of the management committee had been hand- picked by Ndebele. But they were acting on an interim basis, he said, and were not permanent members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Allied Structures also called for a change in the composition of the university senate. &quot;The senate is dominated by conservative Afrikaners who are opposed to democratic processes. These people surround Ndebele and he does not see beyond them,&quot; said student representative council president Gilbert Kganyago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kganyago criticised the management council and the senate members for turning away students who did not have money to continue their studies, saying they were ignoring national policy that no student should be refused education because of an inability to pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of the end of October, university officials said, the student debt stood at nearly R70-million. Student council representatives said the university has ordered all students to pay at least 50% of the money they owe before they will be allowed to register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack Klaas, assistant registrar for financial aid, said that while &quot;no academically performing student will be excluded&quot;, the debt was a drain which the institution can ill afford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 90% of those in debt were doing poorly academically, and some owed as much as R31 000 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By this week about 6 000 needy students, nearly half of the campus population, had submitted their names to the student council. They will be interviewed by a panel created to determine individual needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiltshire said most of the problems on campus are due to a lack of funds.  The university, he said, needs to spend at least R657-million to upgrade its facilities. Built for a maximum of 4 500 students, the university now accommodates 16 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiltshire questioned the motives of those going public with their criticism, because all interests have representation in the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But students like Kganyago maintain that most decisions are taken without consulting stakeholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, top management decided to scrap the staff development programme, according to the representive of the administrative and technical staff, Jay-Jay Mavanyisi. Workers involved were not consulted, and there is no replacement for the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students have also accused management of disregarding democratic decisions.  Kganyago said the council, on the recommendations of senate, rejected three out of eight academics elected to serve as deans of faculties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Kganyago, the senate said the three rejected candidates were not qualified for the positions, but two had the same academic qualifications as the candidates who replaced them. Deans are elected biennially by students and academics in the faculties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH AFRICA has banned the use, storage, manufacture and development of landmines. Defence Minister Joe Modise told a media briefing on Thursday that landmines would no longer be part of South Africa's war machinery. The government endorsed the position of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is that whatever strategic advantage landmines may offer is far outweighed by the &quot;appalling humanitarian consequences&quot; of using them, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Baby's back, but case continues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BABY TIMOTHY is back in the arms of his adoptive parents Barry and Julia Funnell, but the Funnells still do not have money to appeal the Pretoria Supreme Court decision overturning the adoption. The court ruled the Funnells can keep Timothy until the Appellate Division rules otherwise. Their attorney, Deon Roder, a friend of the baby's natural mother, Adri Naud', says they are trying to secure legal aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baby Timothy was kidnapped from the Funnell's home in Blantyre, Malawi, last weekend and found unharmed on Monday night. The Funnells, who are Baptist missionaries, have accused the child's natural father Lawrie Fraser.  Fraser's attorney, Peter Soller, says he thinks the kidnapping was a ploy to discredit his client. Soller says it's obvious that the Funnell's only hope for a successful appeal is if Fraser is implicated in the kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Take it further</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE executive of the Western Province Cricket Association wants Percy Sonn to explain what he meant by his comment, reported last week in the Mail &amp; Guardian: &quot;The white English people on the executive live in England and not in the Cape and should return there because they can't handle a coloured person as president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive called Sonn before them during last week's match between Western Province and Australia. They also wanted to know what he meant when he said: &quot;Elements on the executive are out to get me, but if they stab me in the back I will stab them in the stomach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sonn, who is also Western Cape deputy attorney general, says he never said any such thing, though he did acknowledge that he told sports commentator Martin Locke &quot;to fuck off back to Rhodesia&quot;, which was reported in the same article. Association president Clem Druker said the matter would be taken further if M&amp;G stands by its story. The M&amp;G stands by its story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Superintendent rearrested</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CAPE TOWN police superintendent, suspended after he was arrested on charges of raping a child, has been arrested again for fraud. The charge is that he collected money saying it was for charity and kept it for himself.  Police this week said the superintendent, who was suspended in October 1995, may have made as much as R12 000 from shops in the Claremont area before he was caught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Claremont community police forum figured out something was amiss when they tried to get donations from shops in the same area for the South African Police Service. They alerted the police anti- corruption unit. The investigation is continuing and no charges have been brought. Meanwhile, the child rape case has resumed in Cape Town Regional Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge is that the superintendent raped his 12-year-old niece. He cannot be identified to protect the identity of the child.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Flight SA 232 from Johannesburg to London on February 6 1993, two months before Chris Hani was assassinated, had three passengers of note - the South African Communist Party leader himself; right-wing journalist Arthur Kemp, who was later arrested in connection with his murder; and Inkatha Freedom Party militarist Philip Powell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This &quot;coincidence&quot; was discovered by the Mail &amp; Guardian amid allegations that Hani's assassination had been part of a plot that went beyond right-wing politician Clive Derby-Lewis and Polish immigrant Janusz Walus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kemp gave the tip-off about the South African Airways passenger list to a London Sunday paper a number of weeks ago during an attempt to sell new evidence on Hani's assassination. The flight details were verified by M&amp;G.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kemp was not charged with the murder, but was used as a state witness in the trial - he had supplied address details for the &quot;hit list&quot;. This week, he remained mum, saying only: &quot;I have a story to sell. I am prepared to negotiate the price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to the M&amp;G this week, Kemp invited the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to revisit the assassination - claiming it would find nothing new as &quot;there is nothing to hide&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kemp, now resident in London, also denied he had been associated with the old National Intelligence Service (NIS), as claimed in the M&amp;G last week. The allegation that he had been a source for the NIS had been confirmed by members of the police and the new National Intelligence Agency before publication. He did not deny he had earlier been with the police security branch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SACP deputy secretary general Jeremy Cronin confirmed Hani had been on the flight, saying he had been with a delegation en route to Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell confirmed he had been on the same flight, saying he was on a holiday to London. He had encountered Kemp at Johannesburg International Airport before boarding, and had only realised Hani was on the same flight when he saw him at passport control in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell's alleged role in IFP military activities - and links to the apartheid security forces - was highlighted last year in the trial of Vlakplaas commander Eugene de Kock. Testifying in mitigation of sentence, De Kock said Powell had been a security branch agent and was later associated with the Military Intelligence front company Longreach. De Kock implicated Powell in Vlakplaas-backed gunrunning to IFP military units in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The lineout Steve Tshwete will field in his match with Louis Luyt could include the Receiver of Revenue, reports Stuart Hess</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPORTS Minister Steve Tshwete's special task force will use alleged tax evasion, a charge with criminal implications, as the main thrust of its investigation into rugby supremo Louis Luyt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian established this week that the team, set up to probe allegations against the South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) and its president Luyt, is targeting the tax issue. A tax investigation would give the team enormous powers to probe into the complicated financial affairs of Luyt's rugby empire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G also has documents which claim that Sarfu had a transcript of the Andr' Markgraaff &quot;kaffir&quot; tape sometime between November 20 and December 6 last year. Sarfu has denied it knew of the tape's explosive contents until it was broadcast earlier this week,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshwete's team was to present the allegations to Luyt and his Sarfu executive on Friday, following a week in which the two sides publicly swapped insults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations were handed to Tshwete last December by former Transvaal Rugby Football Union (TRFU) vice-president Brian van Rooyen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tax probe may focus on the TRFU, of which Luyt is also the president.  The TRFU functions as an association not for gain under old legislation and is exempted from paying income tax, although it has shown a healthy profit in the last two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Finansies &amp; Tegniek, which has probed deeply into the Luyt dynasty, the TRFU hides all its wealth in a private company, Ellis Park (Pty) Ltd, which was revalued in a preliminary profit report this week at R104- million. The TRFU owns all the shares and debentures in the company, but about three years ago became embarrassed by its wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRFU members handed over their right to vote and their right to the dividends and debentures in Ellis Park to trustees of the Transvaal Rugby Sport Trust in 1994, following a recommendation from Luyt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauging Ellis Park's income is difficult as it can distribute its profit in the form of debenture interest to avoid tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G understands Tshwete's team wants to use every legal means at its disposal to unpack Luyt's rugby kingdom. The Receiver of Revenue has powers to demand all receipts and details of transactions stretching back for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if the task force is not satisfied with its investigations at the end of its mandate, Tshwete will institute a judicial commission of inquiry into Sarfu - the same fate which befell the South African Football Association (Safa), which cost Safa chief Stix Morewa his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task team will also investigate lucrative sponsorship deals Luyt brokered in Sarfu's name. These include the R2- billion Sanzar deal signed by Luyt and media magnate Rupert Murdoch, and the as yet undisclosed sum paid by sports clothing company Nike for the rights to clothe the national rugby team.  Van Rooyen's report attempts to expose who got paid what in terms of the sponsorship deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1995 Sanzar deal - which gives exclusive broadcast rights in the Southern Hemisphere to Murdoch - almost prompted Sarfu's senior vice- president Mluleki George to quit as the deal was so secret that not even George has seen its contents. &quot;Every sponsorship deal has a secrecy clause,&quot; Luyt said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshwete this week criticised Luyt's handling of South African rugby, saying he ran it as if it were his &quot;property&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not going to plead with arrogant people like Luyt to obey the ministry and co-operate with the task force,&quot; Tshwete said. Reacting to reports that Luyt would resist a task team's investigation into rugby irregularities and possibly take legal action against him, the minister said: &quot;Let him take legal action, it will merely complicate the issues, but if he wants a fight he'll get a fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luyt has denied any knowledge of the tape on which former national rugby coach Markgraaff made racist remarks about George. According to Sarfu chief executive Rian Oberholzer (Luyt's son-in-law), the union only became aware of the contents of the tape earlier this week when it was aired on SABC television. &quot;Dr Luyt did not know about the content of the tape; he only knew it existed,&quot; said Oberholzer. Sarfu denies receiving any transcript of the tape late last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But former Griqualand West captain, Andr' Bester - the man who taped the conversation with Markgraaff on October 22 last year - said in an affidavit that a copy of the transcript was sent to the Griqualand West Rugby Union late last year. A letter which the M&amp;G has in its possession clearly indicates that Sarfu sought legal advice concerning the issue long before the tape's contents were aired this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Oberholzer said the crisis in South African rugby was the work of &quot;sinister&quot; parties aiming to discredit &quot;certain individuals&quot; within Sarfu.  &quot;The timing of the release of this tape is well- orchestrated, to coincide with the establishment of the government's task team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Markgraaff also said he was the first &quot;victim&quot; of the &quot;sinister&quot; group. &quot;There is an attack aimed at certain individuals within rugby. I've been targeted so I must go.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Stefaans Brummer reports on underhand tactics at the pre- election negotiations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE African National Congress &quot;deployed women&quot; to compromise its National Party opponents during the pre-1994 negotiations - and entrapped a senior negotiator, a top ANC intelligence official says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim that the ANC's Department of Intelligence and Security (DIS) successfully used the &quot;honeytrap&quot; method - the oldest trick in the book of intelligence plots - corroborates intelligence documents in possession of the Mail &amp; Guardian that say a prominent hardline NP Cabinet member acted as a &quot; mole&quot; for the DIS as it had &quot;a hold&quot; over him which was &quot;directly related to (his) personal life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mole, repeatedly referred to in the documents by the alias &quot;C Witkoppen&quot; , is disclosed in one, dated April 6 1993, as the NP minister. The DIS official, now a senior member of one of the country's newly amalgamated intelligence agencies, independently gave the same name.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While NP and ANC negotiations this week said the allegations were untrue or unlikely, the intelligence official said the minister had been one of the &quot; successes&quot; of the ANC spy agency's efforts to compromise NP negotiators. &quot;We had a job to do, and we did it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said the minister had been trapped in about October 1992 - shortly after the &quot;record of understanding&quot; between the ANC and the NP, which heralded the final phase of negotiations that led to South Africa's first democratic elections in April 1994. He claimed another senior NP negotiator, whom he did not name, was also &quot;compromised&quot; when the DIS learnt of his gay activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said the plot had soon outlived its usefulness when the government's then- National Intelligence Service (NIS) got wind of it and told DIS members: &quot;We know what you are up to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he could not disclose whether the &quot;mole&quot; had in fact been useful to the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former NP minister is one of the central figures in a storm raging in the NP and Afrikaner circles after recent accusations that former President FW de Klerk had &quot;caved in&quot; to ANC demands at the negotiations table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former minister this week claimed the documents were a disinformation plot against him, but did not speculate who may have been behind it. He dismissed the DIS official's &quot;confirmation&quot;: &quot;I am not going to talk about such nonsense with you; you are wasting my time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents implicating him are from a string of intelligence reports composed by former Civil Co-operation Bureau agent Eugene Riley, who died in an unsolved shooting in early 1994. In 1993, he was a freelance agent for the NIS. The M&amp;G last month published details from the Riley file which implicated a group of DIS members in a wider conspiracy to assassinate South African Communist Party leader Chris Hani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents on the &quot;mole&quot;, like the Hani documents, are based on information given to Riley by &quot;Ramon&quot;, described in the documents as an ANC member. Both sets of documents were addressed to &quot;P&quot;, whom the M&amp;G has identified as Riley's NIS handler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;mole&quot; documents include the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* March 29 1993: &quot;Disinformation&quot; relating to &quot;a concept of how the negotiations are going to be jeopardised if the Transkei's sovereignty is to be invaded&quot; has been sent to the government negotiating team through mole &quot;C Witkoppen&quot; as part of &quot;Operation Puma&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disinformation exercise was to test the government stance on the Transkei, its military leader Bantu Holomisa and the Azanian People's Liberation Army - as the ANC armed wing, Umkhonto weSizwe, needed to know the government stance for its own strategic planning purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disinformation was passed to &quot;Witkoppen&quot;, in typed form, by means of a &quot; dead letter box&quot; in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* April 6 1993: &quot;A photograph and the name of the 'mole' C Witkoppen alias (name withheld) has been obtained from the source 'Ramon'.&quot; (Attached to this document is a photocopied photograph of the &quot;mole&quot;.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* April 9 1993: &quot;All information received from C Witkoppen is sent by the abovementioned to specific 'dead facsimiles' ... The abovementioned fax machines are housed in covert offices/houses in Rivonia, Sandton, Parkhurst, Houghton, et cetera ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The source claims that the ANC's hold over the mole is directly related to the mole's personal life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents contain obvious inaccuracies. In some of them, &quot;Witkoppen&quot; is referred to as &quot;a mole in the office of Roelf Meyer&quot; - an historical inaccuracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The April 9 report also says &quot;Witkoppen&quot; had already been in contact with his ANC handler, &quot;Eric&quot;, for three years. This contradicts the DIS member's account that the minister had been &quot;compromised&quot; in about October 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister played a prominent role in the Codesa II negotiations, which ended inconclusively in May 1992. Negotiations between the ANC and the NP only restarted after the Bisho massacre, when the &quot;record of understanding&quot; was reached between the two parties that September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister was not on the government's full-time negotiating team when multi-party negotiations restarted in early April 1993, but he would still have had access through his membership of Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The obvious inaccuracies in Riley's intelligence reports can be explained in two ways: intelligence chains are notoriously unreliable and mistakes may have been made by any of the actors, including Ramon's informants, Ramon himself, or Riley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second explanation: the documents are badly composed fabrications - although their apparent origination with Riley, who died more than three years ago, makes it unlikely they are recent fabrications. This scenario also fails to explain the corroboration from the intelligence official.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Roelf Meyer set off into the political wilderness this week to seek a black Messiah to lead a new movement capable of challenging the African National Congress in 1999, and salvaging the moderate faction of a fragmenting National Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talent-spotting for a new black leader, Meyer told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week, would be one of his main tasks - one he can now focus on after effectively abandoning leadership of the NP to hardliners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is accompanied in his quest by five trusted moderates: Sheila Camerer, Paulina Cupido, Nic Koornhof, John Mavuso and David Malatsi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are to move around the country, talking to influential figures, church leaders and businessmen to attract those who want to create a strong opposition to the ANC to prevent it dominating politics in the 21st century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer was freed up for the task on Wednesday when party leader FW de Klerk stripped him of his secretary general post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP has already consulted Professor Frederick van Zyl Slabbert, a man experienced in opposition politics, for advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week he described the NP's dream of a new black moderate opposition leader as the stuff of &quot;political fantasies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Zyl Slabbert believes Meyer's journey into the unknown may presage the end of the NP, with a loss of its current voters to the left and the right, and a small core in the Western Cape hanging on to the hardline attitudes of conservative whites and coloureds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If his search to find a great black hope fails, Meyer may have to lead the new movement himself. But commentators doubt he has the right touch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is a good man, perhaps too much of a gentleman, and he has done an important job. But I don't think he has the personality to be the leader of a party ... they don't need a new leader or a new name - they need a new nature, &quot; political scientist Professor Sampie Terreblanche said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer's attempts to change the party's &quot;nature&quot; have been hampered by the success of his colleagues in the Western Cape, under Kriel's leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kriel and his allies are appealing to a segregated audience - undermining Meyer's real chances of setting up a multi-racial future for the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By sending Meyer out - or allowing him to be pushed - De Klerk is forcing his party to speak in two voices: one of sectoral interest, the other of a multi-racial opposition. The NP has had great experience doing the former, but very little in articulating the latter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What must be even more upsetting to Meyer is that the Democratic Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party have appeared unsympathetic to the notion of a new movement, preferring instead to flirt with the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer remains optimistic: &quot;The basic point is the need to make a start at forming a new political movement, to take an initiative, and there are far more signs now that people are interested than they were. Success breeds success, we must get the ball rolling.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Efforts continued today in Cape Town, South Africa, to bring the warring parties in Zaire together for talks. Parks Mankahlana, spokesman for President Nelson Mandela, said the South African government was not releasing any details, reports Reuters. After speculation yesterday over the first face- to-face talks between the government and the rebels, the South African government is trying to contain expectations by emphasising that the talks will be &quot;a long process&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Laurent-Desire Kabila, leader of the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, said that Kabila was only ready for talks in South Africa &quot;with people who are mandated to make a decision&quot;. The spokesman, Deo Bugera, nevertheless said that the ADFL was scaling down their military offensive to assist efforts to start up peace talks. Kabila has previously insisted on meeting with Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko. Ailing President Mobutu is due back in France tonight, report news agencies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of face-to-face talks in South Africa neutralises a rebel deadline of February 21 (today), wherein the ADFL threatened to go on a major offensive unless Kinshasa agreed to talk. Fighting intensified at the begining of this week, with the Zairean government bombing rebel-held towns and the rebels threatening military bases and air-strips. Fighting appears to have lulled since Thursday, when at least four diplomatic peace initiatives came to the fore (see IRIN Update 105), although representatives of the Zairean crisis government in Kinshasa have continued to issue threats of more air-raids. Earlier this week, some reports indicated that the government troops had pushed back rebel forces between Lubutu and Walikale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* According to state-owned KBC, President Moi of Kenya announced today that a major summit would be held in Nairobi on 12th March &quot;to discuss conflict resolutions in various parts of Africa&quot;. The report did not specify if the March 12th summit would discuss the Zairean crisis, nor that it was the anticipated &quot;Nairobi III&quot; summit. The &quot;peace quartet&quot; of Foreign Minsters from Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe said yesterday Zairean Ministers of Defence, Foreign Affairs and Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo in Kinshasa had expressed a willingness to attend the &quot;Nairobi III&quot; conference, but had said that foreign troops must first be withdrawn so that the summit would be &quot;a forum to discuss the future of Zaire&quot;. The Foreign Ministers said their respective heads of state had to be briefed before the date and venue of &quot;Nairobi III&quot; could be announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there is general consensus on the need for a &quot;Nairobi III&quot; summit - based on a five-point peace plan proposed by Joint OAU/UN Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region, Mohamed Sahnoun, and endorsed by the UN Security Council, there is debate about who will participate and what the agenda should be. The official stance of the Zairean crisis government has consistently been that foreign troops withdraw before peace talks proceed.  The Zairean government accuses Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi of being involved in the conflict; an accusation the countries deny. The rebel ADFL, on its part, says any attempt to resolve the crisis without ADFL representation is unacceptable. The first two regional heads of state summits on the crisis were hosted by President Moi in Nairobi - but rebels have since accused him of being partisan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Yesterday evening Joint OAU/UN Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region, Mohamed Sahnoun, met in Nairobi with UN Regional Humanitarian Coordinator Martin Griffiths before flying on to Geneva. Martin Griffiths said the various peace initiatives were an important development and that &quot; the concerted movement towards cessation of hostilities should aid progress on a Nairobi III summit, and also help vital humanitarian access&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Food arrival by truck this week at the Tingi-Tingi camps increased food availability. Trucks carrying 410 tons took four days to reach Tingi-Tingi from Kisangani - up to now, food deliveries have depended on daily flights from Kisangani, which have been hampered by obstruction and fuel appropriation by authorities. One UN aid worker said getting food to Tingi- Tingi is &quot;not a logistical nightmare, it's a political nightmare&quot;. According to WFP, the food is now being distributed at sector level organised by women's committees. Lack of staff and an implementing partner means food must be distributed and monitored by refugees. This method tries to ensure that food reaches children and families. However, concern remains that armed Rwandan militia receive food earmarked for genuine refugees; an issue that can only be resolved through separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The speaker of Burundi's parliament, Leonce Ngendakumana, said in a press conference yesterday that negotiations were needed because &quot;war does not lead to peace&quot;, reports AFP. He said hundreds of citizens were being killed either by armed groups or by the army, and there were arbitary arrests and harassment of people. He said the effects of sanctions was to make Burundi &quot; cut off from the world&quot; and that Burundi needed to find a means of dealing with the crippling regional sanctions. Ngendakumana faces legal proceedings related to the 1993 upheavals, and was banned last December from leaving the country. He was also recently arrested after criticizing the regroupment policy. The Burundian authorities have re-grouped in camps well over 100,000 people in rebel-affected areas; disease in the camps has increased, according to the World Health Organisation, because of insanitary conditions and lack of shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha delayed the first hearing in the trial of Theoneste Bagosora after the defence counsel failed to appear in court. Theoneste Bagasora, cabinet director in Rwanda's former defence ministry, is believed to have directed events during the first few days of massacres in Rwanda in April 1994 and is widely considered the most wanted genocide suspect indicted by the Tribunal. The next hearing is set for March 7th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* According to diplomatic sources, insecurity in Rwanda is &quot;of major concern&quot;. Killings, ambushes, and harassment of civilians by armed groups, have increased dramatically since the massive repatriation. Travel for UN agencies from Kigali to western Prefectures needs a government escort.  According to one humanitarian source, the need for government escort makes it difficult for UNHRFOR to impartially monitor human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Amnesty International, the London-based human rights organisation, accused Zairean soldiers of gross abuse of human rights, saying retreating soldiers had raped and killed with impunity. It called on the Zairean government to respect human rights, and called on governments to stop supplying weapons and military personnel to armed groups in the region.  Independent human rights monitoring in rebel-held areas has yet to be established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* While there are now large groups of refugees now accessible to humanitarian agencies in eastern Zaire at Tingi-Tingi, Kalima and Punia, totalling an estimated 193,000, UNHCR calculates that by the end of January 1997, as many as 189,000 more Rwandans and 39,000 other Burundians are still unaccounted for. The breakdown of figures - which refer only to refugees in Zaire from Rwanda and Burundi - is as follows. In order to save space, we have compressed the table as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Category: Total figure (Figure for Rwandans/Figure for Burundians)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total refugees before the conflict: 1,258,158 (1,111,232/146,945)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total returns to country of origin up to end-January 97: 815,996 (726, 164/100,000)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrivals in third countries: 10,168 (2,168/8,000)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remainder: 432,013 (385,068/46,945)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portion of remainder located: 193,000 (187,000/6,000)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portion of remainder unaccounted for: 229,265 (189,590/39,675)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These figures are of course best estimates, but take into account estimated births and deaths. They also correct a slip on returnee numbers contained in IRIN Update 101.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Frenchman Phillipe Troussier has been named foreign technical adviser to Nigerian national soccer teams after he edged out two other European rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the Nigerian Football Association, retired retired Col.  Abdulmumuni Aminu, announced after the association's marathon meeting Thursday that Troussier was chosen because he was one of the three candidates in employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unsuccessful candidates were Kalman Meszoley from Hungary and German Burkard Ziese.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Troussier, currently coaching a club in Morocco, replaces Johannes Bonfrere, the Dutchman who ditched Nigeria after leading the country to an Olympic soccer victory in August, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aminu said in addition to an undisclosed sign-on fee, Troussier would be paid 10,000 U.S. dollars a month, 2,500 more than Bonfrere got.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trousier, 42, is on record as one of a few European coaches that could boast of a grasp on African football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After handling several clubs in Cote d'Ivoire, he took over the country's national team the &quot;Elephants&quot; into the African qualifying series of the 1994 world cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He becomes the 18th foreign coach in Nigeria, beginning with Englishman Les Courtier, who in 1956 handled the country's national team, then known as the &quot; Red Devils.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the sport has since grown in importance and popularity in Nigeria, such that soccer buffs consider it a unifying factor in the multi-ethnic, culturally diverse and populous nation of some 100 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A delighted Troussier, commenting from Rabbat on his selection says &quot;it is an honor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pledged to do his best with Nigeria's array of talented soccer players scattered across the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His first crucial task will be leading Nigeria to qualify for the world cup in France in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Troussier's selection has been hailed by a cross-section of Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tormer Nigerian international Thompson Oliha, who played for Cote d'Ivoire's Africa Sports during Troussier's stint in that country, said the Frenchman was capable of results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiwo Ogunjobi, manager of Shooting Stars, a division one club based in Ibadan, western Nigeria, called Troussier's appointment a good choice by the football association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said soccer administrators in the country should now settle down to serious work because it would be a &quot;calamity&quot; if Nigeria failed to qualify for France '98.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operation was conducted with fixed wing aircraft and helicopters of the Zimbabwean and South African air forces. They also carried essential aid such as medicines and school materials to areas that were cut off from the district capitals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, at least 20,000 people from Mozambican provinces of Tete and Zambezia are reported to have taken refuge in neighbouring Malawi, in the region of Sange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Little information is immediately available on these people but the Mozambican official relief body, the D.P.C.C.N., says it will send a team to assess the needs of these Mozambicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency's national director, Silvano Langa, said that because of still rising water levels of the Zambezi River and its subsidiaries, the number of people destitute may increase. For this reason, the agency said it was difficult to estimate the quantity and type of aid needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we will need at least 2,000 tons of seeds to distribute to people as they resettle. We are aware that thousands of families will need tools because they have lost everything in the floods,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mozambican government, he said, will meet Monday with donor organizations and United Nations agencies. It will be asking for emergency aid for flood victims in the four central provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not yet have the estimate of our needs but the main concern that we will take to the meeting has to do with activities to be carried out after the floods. We are talking of roads and bridges, medicines, chemical products for water treatment and for agriculture but we also have serious needs for food and tools,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another task that the government proposes to undertake is to try and persuade people to stay away from areas vulnerable to floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They may have their fields there but we are going to discourage the building of houses,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS, New York (PANA) - Nigeria's foreign affairs minister, Tom Ikimi, and the United Nations have called for the strengthening of the West African Peace Monitoring Group, or Ecomog, as the peace process in Liberia enters perhaps a last and crucial stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi told the second ministerial meeting of the special conference to support the peace process Thursday that the Nigerian-led peacekeeping force remained the key to providing adequate security in Liberia, particularly during the May general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important that we give due consideration to the need to sustain the peace momentum now prevailing in the country,&quot;he said. &quot;Ecomog should, therefore, be strengthened and provided with adequate resources.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was attended by representatives of donor countries, member states of the Economic Community of West African states who sent the peace monitors to Liberia, and the United Nations system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was organized jointly by Nigeria, which currently holds the chairmanship of Ecowas, the United States and the Netherlands. It was hosted by the U.N.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan presided at the meeting, which he said was not a pledging conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi, who arrived in New York on Wednesday, said that although the original projection for Ecomog to be able to cover Liberia effectively was 18, 000 men, the force was currently 8,980-strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, he called for help to airlift troops that had been pledged by Benin, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Niger, and to enhance Ecomog's capability, in line with the current effort to ferry troops from Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi, who was accompanied on his trip by the special envoy of the Ecowas chairman for Liberia, Balarabe Balewa, said that Germany, the Netherlands and the United States had helped Ecomog. The United States Air Force began airlifting additional Ghanaian troops to Liberia, Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Ikimi said that the force still suffered &quot;substantial inadequacies in order to meet any eventualities and cope with the demands of the upcoming elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called for a better coordination within the U.N. system to ensure the provision of emergency relief and support facilities, and a streamlining of the role of the world body and its partners to remove duplication and waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the meeting of the decisions by the Ecowas Committee of Nine in Liberia and that so far 28,000 men have been disarmed. But the momentum, he said, had to be maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be a wise option for us all, including genuine potential donors, to hold firmly on the present ray of hope and not let it slip by,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporting this, the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned against complacency in the pursuit of peace in Liberia, in spite of recent positive developments in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While acknowledging the considerable progress that has been made, we must now intensify rather than relax our efforts,&quot; Annan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan also called for the provision of additional resources to Ecomog, the reintegration of demobilized fighters into the society and reactivation of basic institutions of governments and society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, also, that the conditions for free and fair elections must be created and that any effort to disrupt the peace process must be resisted by all concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have the means, let us now clearly demonstrate -- both to the people of Liberia and to ourselves -- that we have the political will to do what needs to be done,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abuja Peace Agreement is generally regarded as the last-ditch effort to bring a lasting peace to Liberia, where an estimated 150,000 people have been killed in seven years of factional fighting and a quarter of the country's estimated 2.82 million people were refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous peace accords, including the Yamoussoukro agreement of 1991, the Cotonou Agreement of 1993 and the 1994 Akosombo agreement, have failed to end the fighting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The multi-million-dollar drive to hold the first-ever Olympic Games on the African continent has suffered what could be a major setback, although a slight possibility of success does still exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Front page news in South Africa Friday is the evaluation report of the International Olympic Committee, released in Lausanne Thursday, which says that Cape Town -- one of the early favorites to host the 2004 Summer Olympics -- has had its bid to stage the games hampered by a rampant crime problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IOC report -- drawn up by an evaluation commission which visited 11 candidate cities during the course of 1997 -- said the biggest concern about Cape Town was the city's serious crime problems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It acknowledged that plans and a detailed strategy had been developed to improve security, but felt their full implementation over the coming years would be a challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also noted that the people of Cape Town were not generally against hosting the Olympics, but that many felt the bid was premature and there were other priorities. The report did acknowledge, however, that holding the games in South Africa would create new jobs and help unify South Africans in this post-apartheid period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Cape Town bid promised to &quot;unify the South African nation through sport,&quot; the report said, it failed on several organizational points, such as the positioning of rowing and canoeing courses in the Olympic Village, with potential security, noise and access difficulties, as well as the crime rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although no clear favorite from the 11 candidate cities emerged in the report, Athens and Rome are believed to be the front-runners. It is felt, however, that Cape Town may still have an outside chance for political reasons, with Africa being the only continent never to have hosted an Olympic Games in the 102-year history of the International Olympic Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five finalist candidate cities will be announced in Lausanne on March 7, and the winner will be named on Sept. 5.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The ancient city of Benin in Mid-western Nigeria has been agog this week with activities marking the centenary of the 1897 invasion of the Ancient Benin Kingdom by imperial British forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to international relations experts, the commemoration involving cultural events, seminars and symposia, which bring together traditional rulers, historians and other scholars within and outside the country, could put to the test the restive socio-political and economic relations between Britain and its former colony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The invasion of the Benin Kingdom, historically known as a &quot;punitive expedition&quot; took place during the reign of Oba Ovonramwen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History has it that the bloody invasion occurred in February during the sacred &quot;Ague&quot; traditional festival when the monarch reportedly refused audience to nine British emissaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently angered by the audacity of the king, the white men allegedly forced their way into the well-fortified kingdom. Seven of them were killed, precipitating the the punitive action during which hundreds of Binis were slaughtered. Oba Ovonramwen was deposed and sent on exile to Calabar in South- eastern Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to official figures, up to 5,000 pieces of artifacts were also looted from the palace, shrines and other cultural treasures in the kingdom during the invasion. The current Benin monarch, Omo n'Oba Erediauwa, a retired top civil servant, is the chief host of the centenary celebration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been receiving visitors from far and wide and hosting many of the events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a seminar co-sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme this week, Nigeria's Navy chief, Vice Adm. Mike Akhigbe, an indigene of the old Benin Kingdom, described the British invasion as an &quot;unfortunate interference&quot; in the affairs of Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to Nigeria's current troubled relations with Britain and other European nations over human rights and democracy, he said &quot;we hear of human rights, but they are not offering us economic survival . . . there has never been a nation that survives on sentiment of human rights without a strong economic well being.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the seminar, Nigeria's information and culture minister, Walter Ofonagoro, condemned what he called &quot;demonization&quot; of the external image of the Benin monarch before the invasion of 1897.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said what Benin suffered at the hand of the British press before and after the invasion &quot;is not too dissimilar to the present day experience of our country Nigeria, which is today being demonized and smeared by the Western press to accomplish the objective of subjugation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said, Nigeria &quot;can counter-force propaganda with incontrovertible fact to the contrary and we are capable of finding realistic alternative in the face of unfair efforts at sanctioning, isolating and targeting our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerians hope to use the centenary celebration to draw world attention to the looting of the rich Benin cultural heritage by the British soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prized items from the kingdom adorn many European museums today, and efforts by Nigerian authorities to retrieve them have not been successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Nigerian campaign is being supported by a British opposition labor parliamentarian, Bernie Gratt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking from Scotland on the BBC Focus On Africa programme on Friday, he said British museums should return the stolen artifacts to the Binis, in line with the principle of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A theft is a theft no matter how long...&quot; he said, adding that in any case, most of the Nigerian artifacts were usually locked away from public view in the museums and ended up in the hands of individual professors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gratt said he would continue to support the campaign until the art works were returned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Namibian tourism officials have targeted the diplomatic community and other institutions in neighbouring Zambia in a tourism promotion programme involving special tour excursions to that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials at the Namibian High Commission in Lusaka said Friday, that the first such tour to Namibia for Zambian-based diplomats, staff serving with international organizations and other public institutions has been scheduled for March 27.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia's deputy high commissioner to Zambia, Kosie Stoffels, said Friday, that it is expected that 50 people will be on the forthcoming five-day excursion to some of Namibia's tourist attractions, including the Namib Desert and the port of Walvis Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stoffels said invitations had been sent out to embassies, other international and local organizations and schools for interested staff to undertake the tour at a cost of between 650 and 750 U.S. dollars per person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea (of the tour) is in response to enquiries about our country's tourism potential. Some people in Zambia, including visitors, think Namibia is nothing but dry desert and we want them to see for themselves what our country can offer in this sector,&quot; Stoffels said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia's tourist attractions include the Namib Desert itself which is reputed for its variety of plant and animal life and the Fish River Canyon regarded as one of the great natural wonders of Africa. It consists of a 160- kilometer ravine which runs up to 27 kilometres wide in places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other attractions include the Daan Viljoen Game Park on the outskirts of the capital, Windhoek, which Namibian tourism officials say is most popular with short-time visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourism ranks third as the country's major foreign exchange earner after mining and agriculture. The industry in 1991 earned some 128 million U.S dollars, or 6.5 percent of that country's Gross Domestic Product.</SPAN></P>

To avoid violating sanctions, delegates will have to make their own travel arrangements by road or sea from nearest points to Libya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sanctions were imposed by the Security Council in April 1992. Libya was punished because it failed to hand over for trial, in the United States or Britain, two of its citizens who were accused of involvement in the bombing of Pan-Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, killing all 270 passengers. Libya wants the men tried in a neutral country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the ministers are taking inconvenient routes to reach Tripoli, their determination to do so is seen as an act of solidarity with Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The annual meeting, which is normally devoted to budgetary and administrative matters of the O.A.U., will also consider pressing political and economic issues of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top on the agenda is the prevailing crisis in the Great Lakes region. O.A.U officials said that the sanctions against Libya will also figure at the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O.A.U. Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim will report on the situations in the Great Lakes, Burundi, Liberia, Somalia and Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His reports will also deal with the organization's peace fund and the dispute between Libya on one hand, and with it and the United States, Britain and France, on the other. France's dispute with Libya is over claims by Paris that Tripoli was involved in the 1989 crash in Niger of the French UTA jetliner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another important agenda item is the state of economic integration in Africa. The treaty formalizing the African Economic Community came into force in 1994. The conference will look into ways of speeding up implementation of recommendations for viable sub-regional economic integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These recommendations were adopted in November 1996 by the first Economic and Social Commission of the O.A.U. and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dire financial state of the Dakar-based Pan African News Agency, PANA, a specialized agency of the O.A.U., is also on the agenda. Non-payment of annual contributions, some of which have accumulated over several years, have more or less paralysed the agency's operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting will review the rate of implementation of the UNESCO recovery plan for PANA, to make the agency a self-supporting privatized entity able to compete effectively with other international news agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also consider a draft protocol on the establishment of an African Court of Human Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accumulated membership arrears owed the O.A.U., which two years ago stood at some 60 million U.S. dollars, was down to some 17.4 million as at 31 January, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defaulters are 11 member states of which three -- Cape Verde, Comoros and Zaire -- face sanctions. They will lose votes and other privileges, subject to their scheduling plan to pay a substantial amount of their arrears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During its last regular meeting in Addis Ababa in 1996, the Council approved the organization's biennial budget for 1996-98, amounting to 61.45 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It consisted of 30.6 million dollars for the 1996-97 fiscal year ending June and 30.85 million dollars for the 1997-98 fiscal year which begins in July.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE, TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. EASTERN ZAIRE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 General</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Zaireans displaced by the rebel insurgency continue seeking asylum in neighbouring countries. Zaireans are crossing into Kigoma, Tanzania, at the rate of 1,000 to 2,000 per day. Refugees arrive in canoes, paying a fare to cross the lake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Thousands of Zaireans are also reportedly arriving in Bazi, in southern Sudan. Seemingly, there are now 10,000 Zaireans in this border town. There are some concerns regarding the food situation in this cut-off Government- held town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) Influx of Zaireans into Zambia currently stands at 7,200 people. UNHCR and the Government of Zambia are screening the refugees and relocating them in transit centres near Kasama, approximately 120 km south of Mpulungu. Since this influx is likely to continue, WFP is investigating various ways to supply food to this location, through local purchases within Zambia, or deliveries from Dar es Salaam to Kigoma and down Lake Tanganyika to Mpulungu or by rail from Dar es Salaam to Kasama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Kisangani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) The WFP airlift to Kisangani from Mwanza in Tanzania began operations on 17 February. Food railed from Dar es Salaam and trucked from Isaka is received in Mwanza and flown into Kisangani with the WFP Ilyushin IL76. The plane arrived in Mwanza after delivering 30 metric tons (mt) of high-energy biscuits to Kisangani direct from Italy. With this new operation, WFP's capacity to supply Kisangani by air has been increased to over 150 mt per day.  However, delays and formalities on the ground in Kisangani allow only one, occasionally two, rotations a day. During the first three days of operation, 120 mt of food were airlifted from Mwanza into Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Other deliveries by air from East Africa to Kisangani continued during the week of 10-16 February. Close to 700 mt of food were airlifted since 6 February, when air operations were resumed. In addition to the food, quantities of soap, blankets, jerry cans and health kits of UNHCR were also transported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Tingi Tingi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Between 10-16 February, WFP delivered 528 mt of food from Kisangani to Tingi Tingi: 115 mt were delivered by air and 413 mt by truck. Other relief agencies are also moving food supplies to the camps. Despite all efforts, the death rate in the camp remains high - 40 persons a day, mostly children and infants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) The presence of armed Hutu among the genuine refugees in the camps in Tingi Tingi has led to growing concerns about a possible attack on the camps by the rebels, despite assurances given by the AFDL that the UN will be given time to find ways to separate the two groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Kalima</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) The new camp of Kalima opened on February 17, to host Rwandan Hutu refugees who fled from Shabunda. The following day, WFP made the first air deliveries to Kalima, carrying 12 mt of CSB. Caritas is setting up kitchens to feed the refugees who are emerging from the forest. Kalima is located 100 km west of Kindu and is served by a relatively good road and an airstrip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 Bukavu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) On February 17, a bombing raid by the Zairean Government on Bukavu left several residents dead and dozens injured. Three planes, flying from the south, hit the local market area. The death toll is expected to increase.  Fearing for their safety, some Bukavu residents are leaving town. This air- strike marks the first such action of the Zairean Government in their offensive to recover lost territories. Other rebel-held areas were reportedly also attacked by planes and the Zairean army advised citizens to leave rebel zones to avoid the bombings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 At the end of October 1996, Kigoma held some 50,000 refugees. By mid- February this figure had increased to over 220,000 people. New arrivals continue to average 1,000 to 2,000 people per day. According to UNHCR the average arriving in Kigoma is 900 Zairian and 300 refugees daily in recent weeks, and the breakdown the numbers hosted by the area on 19 February was some 164,000 Burundi and 60,000 Zairian refugees. Arrivals between 10-16 February were 9,243 into Kigoma; 1,323 into Kasulu and 682 into Kibondo.  Total caseload in Tanzania now 344,355 refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 Relief workers in the Kigoma region face a daily battle with bad roads, frequently rendered impassable after heavy rains. WFP is currently supporting a road rehabilitation project on the Nyakanazi to Kasulu road and has diverted contractor and equipment to provide immediate repairs to some of the most seriously damaged spots (including bridges). However, flooding on some roads continues to hamper operations and the continued delivery of food, water, medical assistance, as well as the movement of refugees themselves from the holding centres to the camps, is described by WFP Tanzania as a daily nightmare for all concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 A total of 4,241 refugees were repatriated from Karagwe to Rwanda between 1 January and 16 February, mostly women and children who were living in the villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.4 The Tanzanian Government has reported that several thousand persons in twenty-four districts in Tanzania will face serious food shortages between the months of March and May this year, due to irregular and delayed rains during the recent short rains season. An action plan is being put together by the Government, UN agencies, NGOs and the donor community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 Tranquillity has yet to be restored in the country. The President of Rwanda's State Council was murdered in his house, along with four other people. Other attacks and ambushes continue to be reported: last week eleven minibus passengers travelling on the main road from Ruhengeri to Kigali were killed. Meanwhile, the killers of the five human rights activists murdered during the first week of February are reported to have died in a clash with the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 WFP has resumed food distributions in some prefectures, albeit on a small scale. There are concerns that irregular food distributions could have a negative impact on the nutritional status of the most vulnerable beneficiaries. Local authorities are working closely with WFP on distribution plans for the rest of the month. New food-for-work projects recently approved by WFP include 10 road rehabilitation projects, 17 projects in the agro- forestry sector and construction of 4,045 new houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 Food deliveries have tentatively re-started, but full-scale operations will only be possible once security is guaranteed, particularly in western prefectures. A first convoy of seven trucks to Kibuye is due to depart on 19 February. The trucks will remain in Kibuye until distributions are completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.4 WFP and other UN agencies have moved some key staff back into prefecture capitals, with the exception of Kibuye. In Cyangugu, Gisenyi and Butare, all expatriate staff are required to live in at specified concentration points, for increased security and to facilitate evacuations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.5 So far during the month of February, 1,824 refugees and returnees crossed the border from Bukavu into Cyangugu. The numbers of people reporting to nutritional centres in Cyangugu and in Gisenyi have dropped, as less people are now crossing the border. Food continues to be provided in the transit centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 New regroupment camps are reportedly being established in Bururi, with 6,000 people in two different camps, and in Bujumbura Rural, with over 50,000 people re-grouped in Gitaza. Preparations are under way for a joint mission comprising WFP, DHA, FAO and UNICEF, to evaluate the situation in the main camps in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 During 10-16 February, WFP distributed close to 2,800 mt of food for 174,569 persons. Food stocks by mid-February stood at 3,680 mt, sufficient to cover requirements for over a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.3 Barges are still not allowed to operate between Kigoma and Bujumbura on Lake Tanganyika. Therefore WFP is now running three truck convoys per week from Ngara, Tanzania, to Ngozi in northern Burundi, bringing an average of 300 mt per convoy. Shuttling between Ngozi and Bujumbura continues full time, carrying food commodities for WFP and other goods for NGOs. Transport problems continue to delay the import of diesel and petrol which was approved by the Government of Tanzania earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. UGANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 In the space of a week, rebels attacked two different camps for Sudanese refugees in northern Uganda. During these attacks, six refugees were mutilated at Invepe Camp, in north-western Uganda, and another one was killed at Achol-Pii, Kitgum district. During 1996, 109 refugees were killed in Achol- Pii when the rebel group the Lord's Resistance Army assaulted the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Rwandan and Zairean refugees are still trickling into Uganda. Since the beginning of February, 676 refugees were received in Oruchinga and Kihihi.  During the same period, close to a thousand Zaireans voluntarily returned home from Kisoro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Displaced and war-affected Ugandans in northern areas continue receiving assistance. In Kitgum, food loaned by the European Union and delivered by WFP is presently being distributed. Water equipment, tankers, tents, medicines and other non-food items have been provided by UNICEF, MSF/France, Oxfam, WHO and AVSI.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 The 1997 UN Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for Sudan was launched in Geneva on February 18. For WFP, the Appeal requests a total USD 40.3 million for food assistance to an estimated 2.65 million persons, in southern Sudan (2.2 million), the transitional zone (374,000) and in Khartoum and White Nile States (78,800).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 WFP plans to deliver 24,300 mt in Northern Sector operations, and 24, 600 mt in Southern Sector operations. As of 21 February, the shortfall for the Northern Sector stands at 10,223 mt (at a value for food and transport of USD 7.8 million) and for the Southern Sector at 13,900 mt (at a value of USD 21.8 million with transport). Transport costs in the Southern Sector are much higher than in the Northern Sector due to unavoidably heavy reliance on air delivery. Additional support is required for Logistics and Base Support (USD 4.2 million) plus Assessment, Programming, Monitoring and Evaluation costs (USD 4.6 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 This year WFP also seeks support for a local purchase of surplus grain in Western Equatoria (total cost USD 523,700) to reduce reliance on external sourcing and to encourage local agricultural activity and grain markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 The full text of the UN Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal can be found on the Internet under the Emergencies section of ReliefWeb at http://www.  reliefweb.int/</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. KENYA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. DROUGHT UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 The over-all cereal imports needed by Kenya due to the affects of drought is currently estimated by WFP at 770,000 mt of maize. Of this, 90 percent will be covered by commercial imports. There are firm indications that of the total, some 200,000 mt will be arriving in Mombassa in February and March. On 7 February, the Kenyan Government removed all import duty on maize imports, a move which is to stay in effect until to 30 June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Government relief efforts include the planned distribution of a total of 23,000 mt in drought affected areas during February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 On 21 February, the WFP Executive Director approved an emergency operation (EMOP 5803) for 24,700 mt of food, valued at USD 12.4 million, which will allow WFP to proceed with a relief intervention, working with NGOs, in the most affected areas: Garissa, Mandera, Marsabit, Mbere, Mwingi, Tana River and Wajir districts. The planned operation is to cover 270,044 school children and 207,000 other drought-affected people up to early August 1997.  The school feeding component is now expected to expand in the future to cover 452,000 children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Steps have been taken by WFP to both borrow and purchase maize and beans from the Ethiopian Grain Reserve, for delivery to districts bordering Ethiopia, and to the Dadaab camp for Somali refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E. SOMALIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 The Somalia Food Security Task Force, made up from members of UN agencies, donors and NGOs working in Somalia, is monitoring the drought situation in all regions of the country. WFP has been mandated to make the necessary arrangements for possible targeted emergency food distribution in southern Somalia. Some 1,500 mt of maize meal are currently being offloaded in Mombassa for pre-positioning inside Kenya for a possible cross-border operation. Fifteen local NGOs who are willing to distribute food have been identified by CARE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 The WFP Food Security Assessment Unit estimates that there is a 53 percent decrease in total cereal production in the current short rains, Deyr season, harvest. However, given the reported existence of farmers' food reserves, the current food availability in local markets, and traditional coping strategies (remittances from abroad, sale and slaughter of livestock, wild fruits, casual labour, and so forth) the food security situation of the population at large is considered to be manageable for the next three months.  A close monitoring of the evolving situation in terms of food availability and access to food (purchasing power) is vital over the coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">F. SIERRA LEONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 An expansion of the WFP emergency operation for Sierra Leone (EMOP 5767.  01) was recently approved, for 35,400 mt of food valued at USD 19 million.  The new phase of the operation is primarily aimed at encouraging the resettlement of more than 770,000 people displaced by civil war over the past six years. Returnees will be given food packages in centres as close as possible to their homes. The feeding of vulnerable groups, malnourished children, the elderly and pregnant and nursing women will continue. Emergency school feeding will continue for displaced children, and later be transferred to areas where children resettle with their families. Food-for-work activities will support the reconstruction process in war-affected areas. WFP will also support former combatants within the context of the demobilization programme.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Warrants of arrest for traffic offences have not been executed by police in the Langa, Guguletu and Crossroads areas since 1991, a confidential Cape Town municipal report has disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 5 000 warrants are outstanding in these areas and the abandonment may have been a key contribution to township traffic chaos, including lack of control over minibus taxis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About R10-million is owed to the municipality in outstanding traffic fines.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report to the municipality's engineering committee said only 8 000 of 20 000 warrants of arrest issued in the city during a nine-month period last year were carried out. The rest were either untraceable (6 500) or had not been dealt with (5 500).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Argus (Cape Town) reported recently that an end could be in sight to traffic anarchy in Peninsula townships, as the traffic department was deploying 37 officers in these areas to increase awareness of road safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the engineering committee report, which was issued late last year, 81 000 outstanding warrants of arrest had accumulated since the implementation of a computerised contravention system in October 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, arrangements to execute warrants across municipal boundaries had fallen apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 5 000 warrants were not executed in township areas last year for this reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of about R10-million owed in fines in the city, according to the auditor's report, about R6,5-million is owed to the State and about R4,5-million to the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is put down to the inability of the State, because of a lack of resources, to execute warrants of arrest for failures to appear in court on traffic offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than R40 000 a month is spent on employing an additional 26 law enforcement officers after hours to execute warrants of arrest and serve summonses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department also has seven traffic officers who are serving warrants full-time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says that the problem of outstanding warrants and non-payment of traffic fines has long been an issue of debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proposals for solutions include decriminalising traffic offences and for non-payment of fines to be recorded against individual vehicle registration records. Any renewal or transfer of licence would require all fines to be settle Among the measures suggested is to lobby Transport Minister Mac Maharaj to make it possible to prevent the renewal or transfer of licences if traffic offences remain unsettle Another suggestion is for community support to be sought to ensure the safe execution of warrants of arrest in the areas of the former Crossroads and Ikapa administrations with the support of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report came to light when it was mentioned during an executive committee debate on the municipality's confidentiality policy, which allows for certain items to be kept on confidential &quot;green&quot; paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was released to the Cape Argus (Cape Town) on request because the outcome of the meeting was recorded in an open minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These minutes are not normally circulated to the media.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Department of Trade and Industry's industrial parks project has been given a boost with a grant from the United Nations Development Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, who is promoting the local industrial parks (LIP) programme, said the United Nations had put forward $155 000 (nearly R700 000) and the Government had contributed R120 000 to a market survey for industrial parks in Lansdowne-Guguletu, the Eastern Cape and the Free State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parks are designed to create employment for people close to their homes, to set up networks between small and bigger businesses and to give small enterprises access to technology and funding.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka said the three parks being studied were the first of many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to see an industrial park in every big town in the country,&quot; she sai Each park should have a theme and development should be run by a &quot; champion&quot;, the deputy minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of the Lansdowne-Guguletu park, the theme was building materials and the &quot;champion&quot; was the Guguletu Reconstruction and Development Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local authorities would also be encouraged to play an active part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka said the plan was to set up manufacturing access centres (MACs) in each park where small businesses would be given access to the latest developments in technology from institutions such as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want these parks to be centres of excellence and the breeding ground for new exporters,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big businesses would be asked to become tenants in the parks, possibly in joint ventures with smaller businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several big businesses had already shown interest in the Lansdowne-Guguletu park, the deputy minister said, citing Mondi Paper and Alpha Cement as examples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, the project would be co-ordinated by the Ntsika agency, the department's small business arm, and finance for small business could be made available through the Khula fund, an independent agency set up to channel funding from the commercial banking sector to small enterprises.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - INTRODUCTION: 1. As a result of successive poor rains, large parts of northern and eastern Kenya are currently facing a severe drought which is undermining the food security of at least two million people (1).  This situation report follows DHA participation in two recent UN inter-agency assessment missions and includes information provided by the Arid Lands Resource Management Programme (ALRMP), the Drought Preparedness Intervention &amp; Recovery Programme (DRIRP), the Famine Early Warning System (FEWS/USAID), UN agencies and NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The report focusses on those parts of the country which current information suggests have been most severely affected by the drought. These are the pastoralist districts of northern and north-eastern Kenya (Garissa, Wajir, Isiolo, Mandera, Marsabit/Moyale) and the marginal agricultural districts of Eastern Province (Machakos, Makueni, Kitui, Mwingi, Mbeere and Tharaka-Nithi). The food security of the people in these districts is of particular concern because of the combination of climatic and economic factors which has made it very difficult for them to exchange livestock, grow, or buy their own food. Brief mention is also made of other areas reported to be seriously affected (2).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NORTH AND NORTH-EASTERN KENYA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The drought in north and north-eastern Kenya follows poor rains during 1995 and well below average rains in the March-June long-rains season in 1996.  These poor rains have since been exacerbated by a very late, poorly distributed and brief 1996 short-rains season, which normally lasts from October to December but which began in mid-November and ended abruptly at the end of November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Pastoralism is the dominant livelihood in the north and north-east, supplemented by a limited amount of agriculture along the River Tana, which flows along the south of Isiolo district and through the centre of Garissa district, and the River Daua, which flows across the north of Mandera district along Kenya's border with Ethiopia. In addition, there are other pockets of crop farming in each district, such as Bute and Gurar in Wajir, Barissa and Takaba in Mandera and along the seasonal Ewaso Ng'iro River in Isiolo district. At present, however, none of these areas makes a significant contribution to the food security of these districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The failure of the rains has inhibited the recovery of vegetation regeneration and failed to fully replenish the pans and dams on which the pastoralists rely for most of their water needs. Most of the pans and dams in the north and north-east have now dried up altogether, while the pans that remain have attracted large livestock herds and are swiftly approaching exhaustion. The boreholes in operation remain an important source of water for both people and livestock, but are also under strain, because of overuse.  In Marsabit, for example, all five boreholes along the road from Marsabit town to Moyale town are reported to have failed, creating a severe water shortage across the centre of Marsabit district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Communities are finding it increasingly difficult to afford the diesel required to run the pumping operations, as well as spare parts for generators and pumps. Some areas now depend on water tankered in from outside, but the north and north-east has only a very small number of working tankers at present. During a recent UN inter-agency asessment mission it was reported that the only available tanker in Mandera district had broken down. In brief, the situation across the north and north-east is that surface water supplies for people and livestock are very scarce and progressively diminishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The shortage of vegetation and water prompted a large-scale migration of pastoralists and their livestock to Ethiopia and Somalia following the failed long-rains in March-June 1996. These communities are reported to have since returned, and to be congregating in areas which received rains during the short-rains season, notably Isiolo district, as well as moving within districts to individual pans and boreholes which still have water. It appears that most of the cattle population remains in neighbouring countries, while camels, which are relatively drought- resistant, have been brought back to Kenya. As people cluster around watering points, the environment is being damaged by overgrazing and the felling of trees for firewood and charcoal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. As pastoralists move further and further beyond their traditional grazing land in search of water and pasture, they are impinging upon the grazing territories of other nomadic groups, leading to conflict. There have been a growing number of cases of livestock rustling and banditry, including the looting of property and hijacking of vehicles. It has been suggested that this is related to the impoverishment of the population as a result of the drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Families have separated, with young men and teenagers accompanying the herds, and women, children and the elderly moving to urban centres in the hope of generating a small amount of income or receiving relief assistance.  Families in Garissa town, interviewed by the recent UN mission, reported having travelled over 200 kms from Hulugho and Sangailu in Garissa South in order to reach Garissa. The town's displaced population, which includes people made destitute in the 1992/93 drought, has swelled further, according to the Garissa District Commissioner. In a separate development, education officials report an increasing number of parents have been forced to remove children from school because of their inability to pay fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The shortage of pasture and water reflects itself in deteriorating livestock health and prices, increasing livestock mortality rates and declining milk production across the north and north-east. In Isiolo, for example, prices for both small and large stock are very low at present, with prices for goats having fallen by 80% from Ksh 1,500 in December 1994 to 300 in December 1996. Prices for cattle dropped by 71% from Ksh 17,250 in December 1994 to Ksh 5,000 in December 1996 (3). The same was true for Mandera in recent months, where between October and December 1996 prices for sheep fell from Ksh 505 to 330, for goats from Ksh 633 to 505, for cattle from Ksh 3,139 to 2,319 and for camels from Ksh 3,411 to 2,084 (4).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The decline in the value of livestock has eroded the purchasing power of pastoralists. At the same time as livestock prices have fallen, the price of maize has increased, resulting in worsening terms of trade. Livestock markets are in a state of glut as pastoralists seek to sell off their stock, but food in stores is going unbought because the herders lack the means to purchase what is available. Worsening livestock health and increased mortality rates have been reported in Garissa, Wajir, Isiolo, Mandera and Marsabit/Moyale districts. Diseases of particular concern are Contagious Bovine Pleural Pneumonia (CBPP) and worm infestation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. These accounts are confirmed by a study of the terms of trade figures produced at the district level. In Wajir, the terms of trade from meat to maize fell from Ksh 28 per kg of meat to Ksh 23 per kg of maize in the first quarter of 1996 to Ksh 18 per kg of meat to Ksh 22 in the last quarter of the year (5). The same situation prevailed in Mandera, where between October and December 1996 the meat: cereal price ratio fell from Ksh 24:22 to Ksh 17:23.  (6). In Isiolo, while there were improvements in the meat: cereal price ratio for most divisions in the last quarter of 1996, the terms of trade for pastoralists worsened in Merti and Sericho divisions (7).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. The effect of food scarcity and declining milk production is making itself felt in terms of human health. Malnutrition rates among children under- five are reported to be rising in all the north and north-eastern districts.  In Wajir, for example, the are up from 18.2% in the first quarter of 1996 to 34.7% in the last quarter. In Mandera, malnutrition among children is reported to have increased from 15.3% in September to 32.7% in December, while severe malnutrition has increased from 3.8% in September to 15.2% in December (8). In Marsabit/Moyale, 18% of children are malnourished compared to 14% in October (9). These malnutrition data were obtained using the MUAC method of measurement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. Malnutrition among children in the Garissa suburbs, where displaced people are currently arriving, is reported to be 34%, while the Merti and Sericho divisions of Isiolo district report child malnutrition rates of 28.9% and 33.6% respectively (10). In addition to rising malnutrition rates, populations are experiencing health problems associated with the lowered resistance to disease arising from their declining nutritional status as well as problems related to vitamin deficiences. In Wajir the recent UN mission received reports of diarrhoea, anaemia and respiratory tract infections, in Garissa cases of night blindness were reported, while in Isiolo there has been an increasing number of cases of dysentry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. The possibility of major outbreaks of infectious diseases is a growing concern, especially given the low rates of immunization coverage in the north- east. Immunization coverage against measles, for example, is estimated at 30% in Mandera district and less than 35% in Wajir district. Another concern is that public health standards are under growing strain as populations cluster in towns and around water sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. Within the north and north-eastern districts, it is possible to distinguish divisions or areas which are particularly severely affected by drought. In Wajir, the south of the district has been most severely affected, as has the northern half of Garissa district. In Isiolo, Merti division in the north, Sericho in the east and Kinna in the south have been most affected.  Little distinction has been made between the degrees of drought affectedness across Marsabit/Moyale, although Sololo division in the north-east received better rains than anywhere else and is the least affected area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. Turkana district in Kenya's north-west shares the same main climatic and economic characteristics as the other parts of north and north-eastern Kenya described above. It too has experienced very poor short rains, however its long-rains season in 1996, though late, was well above average, and therefore the district as a whole is less severely affected than its neighbouring districts to the east. Although livestock prices have fallen, the general health of livestock is reported to be 'fair'. Malnutrition rates across the district, supplied by the MOH, show significant variations, with malnutrition of 32% in the north, 20% in central areas and 9% in the south.  It appears likely that there are pockets within Turkana facing particular difficulties, even though the overall situation is less perturbing than elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EASTERN AND CENTRAL PROVINCES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">18. The marginal agricultural districts within Eastern Province are Machakos, Makueni, Kitui, Mwingi, Mbeere and Tharaka-Nithi. In these districts the short-rains are more reliable than the long-rains, and account for up to 70% of total annual production. Maize is the major crop in all of these districts, while beans, sorghum, millet, pigeon peas and green grams are also grown. The last short-rains season, however, was very poor. Although some of the higher altitude areas received adequate rainfall, in general the rains, which lasted only between 2-4 weeks, were too short to enable the crops to reach maturity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">19. The result was large-scale crop failures in all of these districts, and the estimated shortfalls in maize production are dramatic. In Machakos, a harvest of only 4,500 MT of maize is expected, in comparison with average production of 45,000 MT. Most of this harvest is expected to come from the upper lying divisions of Kathiani, Kangundo and Central. In Makueni, agricultural officials expect a harvest of only 5,400 MT, compared to average production of 36,000 MT. In Kitui, 38,000 hectares were put to maize, but less than 9,000 MT is expected. The same is true for both Mwingi district, where 506 MT of maize is expected in comparison with the average of 15,300 MT, and in Tharaka-Nithi, which anticipates a maize harvest of 3,600 MT, as against the average of 20,000 MT. In terms of beans, the picture is even more grave, with all of these districts anticipating either no beans harvest at all or a tiny fraction of the average (11).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">20. Exceptionally high market prices for both maize and beans reflect the failure of the harvest. Maize is about double its usual price for this time of year, at between 16-21 Ksh per kilogram in comparison to 7-11 Ksh per kilogram at this time last year. Most of the maize is reported to have been supplied from Nakuru and Kitale districts in Rift Valley province. The prices for beans are even more inflated, at between 35-45 Ksh per kilogram, in comparison to about 10 Ksh per kilogram in January 1996. The beans are reported to derive from Tanzania. While prices for staples are rising, the prices of livestock continue to fall, with goats fetching between 600-800 Ksh, about half their price at this time last year (12).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">21. The districts of Makueni, Mwingi, Mbeere and Tharaka-Nithi are the most severely affected of all, having already experienced two poor rainy seasons prior to the recent short-rains. But the situation facing households in all of the districts in the marginal agricultural areas is very serious. They normally depend upon maize and beans not only for their own consumption but also for a large share of their family income. With the prices of staples so dramatically inflated, and livestock prices falling, their food security is under great stress. Some areas don't receive the long-rains at all; for these communities February 1998 will be the next harvest. Farm families are already adopting short term coping strategies such as reducing the number of meals per day, migrating in search of wage labour, and burning charcoal, but it appears unlikely these will suffice without an escalated food relief programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">22. Two other districts also reported to be as severely affected by the drought as the marginal agricultural areas in Eastern province are the districts of Kajiado and Taita Taveta, in Rift Valley and Coast provinces respectively. They share similar agro-climatic conditions to districts like Makueni in Eastern province, however, and both have received poor rains over the past three rainy seasons. Kajiado is predominantly a pastoralist area, while Taita Taveta is primarily agricultural. Recent reports suggest that livestock in western Kajiado are coming under very severe strain and that there has been widespread crop failure in the low-lying areas of Taita Taveta.  A FEWS/USAID assessment mission is currently visiting these areas and will report in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">23. The rains also ended very early in the high potential districts of Embu and Meru in Eastern province and in most of Central Province. In these areas, maize harvests will also be much lower than average and prices for both maize and beans are about twice their usual level. In general, however, the situation in these areas is less grave than in the marginal agricultural areas of Eastern province. Short rains production is less significant in the high potential areas, contributing only 40% of total annual production. The previous rainy seasons in these areas have, moreover, been close to normal, which has helped farm families to build up the assets to see themselves through this period. In addition, these high potential areas are less dependent on maize and beans than the marginal areas, having diversified into other enterprises such as tea, coffee, dairy and pyrethrum (13).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE RESPONSE TO THE DROUGHT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Kenya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">22. The Government of Kenya declared the drought a state of natural disaster on 28 January 1997 and appealed to donors to assist in responding to the crisis. For its own part, the Government has lifted the ban on maize imports and waived all duties on imported maize, pulses, milk and rice intended for relief feeding. The Government has also removed the import duty on commercial maize, which will act an an incentive for commercial importers to make up the estimated 1.3 million tonne shortfall in Kenya over the coming months. As FEWS has pointed out, the current maize deficit is not only the result of the failed short-rains but also reflects Kenya's growing structural deficit in maize production as well as a reduction in the area put to maize in the last long-rains season (14).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">23. The Government will import 180,000 MT of maize, 27,000 MT of beans and 9,000 litres of oil for relief purposes. The Government expects the private sector to import the bulk of the maize shortfall and the first indications are promising. This month traders are expected to import 89,000 MT, while the estimated figure for March is 111,000 MT. Only once in 1994, the last year when maize imports were permitted, did traders import over 100,000 MT in a month (September 1994, when 115,000 MT was imported).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">24. The Government is also stepping up its famine relief allocations of maize, which have been underway for several months. The number of 90kg bags distributed in Garissa, for example, increased from 2,500 bags in September 1996 to 4,500 in November and 10,000 in February. For the country as a whole, the number of maize bags distributed has increased from 50,000 in September, to 78,000 in November, 87,500 in January this year and an estimated 220,000 bags this month. This relief is currently distributed to 36 districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">25. At about 20,000 MT per month the Government's relief effort is a major intervention. Aid agencies have expressed concerns, however, that the relief maize may not be reaching the most vulnerable groups in each community. With 36 districts receiving aid, the relief maize is spread thinly across the country, rather than targetted towards those districts most severely affected by the drought. Within the districts themselves, it has been reported that relief is distributed to everyone present at distribution sites, rather than targetted towards specific vulnerable groups. Another issue of concern is that relief maize is reportedly being sold off in order to pay for transport costs. This makes it likely that isolated communities will receive less aid than they are entitled to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">26. At the district level the local authorities are establishing relief committees to oversee and coordinate relief activities. Called Social Dimensions of Development Committees (SDDCs) and chaired by the respective District Commissioners, they will have a central role to play in ensuring that relief aid is targetted towards areas and communities who have been particularly affected by the drought. In many cases UN agencies and international NGOs working in rural areas participate in the SDDCs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN AGENCY AND NGO PROGRAMMES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">27. At present WFP and UNICEF are actively assisting in many of the country's drought-stricken areas. WFP has a regular school feeding programme reaching 340,000 children, many of whom are in drought-affected areas. In response to the current situation WFP has begun to undertake school feeding programmes in several districts previously not covered, meeting the needs of an additional 128,000 children, and will expand this programme again in March to reach a further 323,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">28. As WFP currently provides food to all the schools in the north and north-east of Kenya, WFP will scale up in Garissa, Wajir, Isolo, Marsabit/ Moyale and Mandera by distributing extra food through selected NGOs. WFP's programme will, by March, be providing food in all of the most severely drought-affected districts described in this report, and is currently seeking funds for its expanded programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">29. UNICEF is currently scaling up its programme in the most severely drought affected areas in the north-east and plans to meet one third of the requirements in the water, health and veterinary sectors if its appeal proposal is funded. Likewise, FAO, in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Office of the President, plans to assist farmers in drought affected areas by providing seeds and handtools for the next planting season to farmers who would not otherwise be able to afford them. FAO will also assist in undertaking emergency veterinary vaccinations. UNDP and DHA will provide funds for income generating projects, emergency transport as well as monitoring and evaluation of the emergency operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">30. There are also a large number of local and international NGOs and chruch organisations working across Kenya, many of them in the most severely drought affected areas. International NGOs and organisations present in the north-east include OXFAM, undertaking a major food distribution programme for 105,000 people in Wajir, MSF-Spain providing supplementary feeding in Mandera, Action Aid and German Agro Action in Isiolo and the Catholic Mission in Isiolo and Garissa. German Agro Action and GTZ are also working in some of the most severely affected districts in Eastern Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">31. Coordination between the Government of Kenya, UN agencies, NGOs and church organisations will be a critical issue as the emergency programme scales up in the coming weeks. WFP has indicated its willingness to coordinate activities by all the different actors in the food sector, while UNICEF will coordinate water, health and livestock interventions. The UN Disaster Management team, chaired by the UN Coordinator in Kenya, will continue to review and monitor the progress of UN interventions during the drought period. A DHA Appeal has already been launched for the north-east and a further UN Appeal is expected shortly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">32. The current and planned relief programmes by the Government of Kenya, UN agencies and NGOs may be expected to avert the worst effects of the drought and prevent the onset of a large-scale crisis, in which large numbers of lives would be lost. Additional measures, however, are highly desirable.  The UN system in Kenya has, as the result of an inter-agency assessment mission to the north-east, set out a series of recommendations to the Government for further actions in the food, water, livestock health and human health sectors (see Appendix). In terms of food alone, mention has already been made of the need to target relief aid towards the most drought affected districts and the most vulnerable groups in each community. It is also a matter of concern that food relief is reaching isolated communities in reduced quantities as the result of being sold off to meet transport costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">33. The planned relief effort seeks to help communities until the onset of the long-rains, expected between March and June. Should the long-rains arrive late, be poorly distributed or end early, many of those communities which have managed adequately until now will be pushed to the margins of survival.  Large parts of Kenya have now experienced three poor rainy seasons in succession and the food security of their communities is already threatened, as stocks and cash reserves approach exhaustion. If the long rains fail the current and planned relief programme will need to be reviewed and swiftly escalated to prevent an even greater crisis. The Government of Kenya, UN agencies and NGOs are keeping this issue at the forefront of their minds and beginning to prepare contingency plans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recommendations to the Government of Kenya by the UN inter-agency assessment team which visited the north-east, 21-23 January:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Import taxes: The Government should lift the import tax on commercial maize and ensure the waiver of all taxes and duties on relief goods. This recommendation has been adopted by the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Port clearance: The Government should give priority to relief commodities over commercial goods passing through the port of Mombasa in terms of granting berthing and discharge, as well as expiditing the process of customs clearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infrastructure/Roads: The Government should urgently undertake further road improvements to help facilitate relief deliveries during the rainy season, giving priority to those areas where roads are in poorest condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security Arrangements: The Government should formalize arrangements for security escorts of relief personnel and goods within high risk areas in order to ensure their safety and welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veterinary Drugs: The Government should subsidize the cost of veterinary drugs to help pastoralists afford basic and urgently-needed drugs for treatment of their livestock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Health Services: The Government should waive charges to the public for the cost of drugs and ward admissions during the crisis period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">School Fees: The Government should consider waiving or subsidizing school fees in areas where the economy has been particularly hard hit by the drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOK Relief Maize: The Government should ensure that maize relief is directed to those in greatest genuine need, and that adequate transport facilities and fuel are readily available to deliver GOK maize relief on a timely basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emergency Resource Allocations: The Government should review and increase its allocation for emergency related needs of essential human drugs, outreach health services, supply and delivery of diesel fuel, spare parts, standby generating sets, veterinary drugs, vehicle maintenance and repairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Master Plan: The Government needs to develop a master plan in order to strengthen existing government programmes in the fields of land tenure, management of wet and dry season grazing patterns, strengthening of livestock marketing infrastructure, and drought preparedness and mitigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Hope that talks in South Africa would lead to negotiations between Zaire's warring parties has dimmed, and fighting in eastern Zaire escalated over the weekend. After an initial promise from the rebels that fighting would be &quot;scaled back&quot; to give the talks a chance, new territory was taken in a fresh rebel advance on Saturday. The Zairean government on its part has refused to negotiate with rebels - saying there had &quot;never been any question of meeting&quot; rebel members - and resumed air-strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila says he will only negotiate directly with Mobutu, otherwise he will &quot;resume hostilities which will raze the country&quot;. Rebel Radio of the People, Bukavu, claimed on Sunday that the rebels were heading for Gbadolite - President Mobutu's home retreat - and were only a few kilometres from Kisangani airport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) have taken Kalima town, the Zairean defence ministry confirmed on Sunday. About 25,000 Rwandans and Burundians, who had been given basic humanitiarian assistance at a site four kilometres outside the town, fled on Saturday when the rebels advanced. A UN plane arrived on Saturday to find the refugee site deserted; UN officials believe many of the refugees are heading southwest towards Kindu (away from the direction of the Rwandan border).  Before they dispersed, people at the refugee site were described by aid workers as being in &quot;very poor condition&quot;. Humanitarian workers say that 15 died on Friday, reports AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from Kisangani say that dozens of people were killed in Zairean air- raids over the last few days. Air-raids are said to be concentrated on rebel positions on the road between Kisangani - the most strategic town yet threatened by the ADFL - and Bafwasende, further north. Government forces say the bombardments will continue until the area is &quot;cleansed&quot;, report news agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* WFP reports that the death rate in Tingi-Tingi remains high despite improved food supplies. About 40 people a day die, mostly children and infants. The presence of armed Rwandan militia in the camps in Tingi-Tingi has led to growing concern about a possible attack on the camps by the rebels, despite the reassurances given by ADFL that the UN will be given time to find ways to separate the two groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The South African government is now attempting &quot;close proximity&quot; talks after failing to arrange face-to-face talks on the Zaire conflict. Honore Ngwanda, a senior security advisor and nephew of President Mobutu Sese Seko, is representing the government and Dr Kalaha Bizima - Kabila's advisor on foreign affairs - is representing the ADFL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African President Nelson Mandela said today he believed progress had been made in multinational efforts towards peace in the Great Lakes region, and that the next step was to set up a meeting between Mobutu and the four African heads-of-state mandated to co-ordinate the peace process. He said the meeting would take place on March 19, but did not name the venue. Mandela said he would speak soon to Kenya's President Moi, who has led regional peace inititiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The East African weekly newspaper reports that the South African diplomatic initiative in the Zaire crisis had the effect of &quot;stealing the ball&quot; from President Moi of Kenya. President Moi hosted two heads of state summits in Nairobi, but has since been denounced as partisan by the rebels. According to diplomatic sources, Moi rejects rebel participation in talks - in contrast to the Mandela initiative. In an editorial, the paper said that the various regional and international initiatives should not be dismissed as: &quot;If a thread leading to a solution can be disentangled from the knotty morass of ambitions currently focussed on the central African giant, such an outcome should be welcomed, whatever the source&quot;. US involvement in the talks has &quot; deepened&quot;, reports the East African, because of fears that Zaire may soon collapse and again raise the spectre of international military intervention - a step that Washington would want to resist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daily state-owned Kenya Times said in a commentary yesterday that the South African initiative &quot;appears to have been made without due consultation with the rest of the players of the mediation efforts and perhaps without due regard to the on-going Nairobi mediation plan&quot;. It said President Mobutu was right to reject talks with rebels and insist that troops from Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda &quot;left Zaire&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Joint OAU/UN Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region, Mohamed Sahnoun, called on the UN Security Council on Friday to intervene urgently in Zaire, which he said could have enormous regional - and even global - consequences. He said that if the five permanent Security Council members (Britian, China, France, Russia and the United States did not apply pressure to end hostilities: &quot;An entire belt of the African continent could be affected&quot;. He said world stock markets would be affected if the vast mineral resources in Zaire are hit. Sahnoun, who recently devised a five-point peace plan endorsed by the UN Security Council, emphasised the need for diplomacy and said armed intervention may have to be used &quot;as a last resort&quot;, reports AFP. In Geneva, Sahnoun talked of the &quot;humanitarian tragedy&quot; in eastern Zaire and the politically explosive neighbouring states of Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Belgian Cooperation Minister Reginald Moreels said in Brussels that the rebels were suspected of sparking &quot;a fresh wave of indiscrimate genocide&quot;. In an interview with Het Laatste Nieuws magazine and on BRTN radio he said the rebels were killing Rwandan Hutus and displaced Zairean citizens. Moreels said it was essential to send in an armed international peace force to the Great Lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Zairean crisis government has appointed a new commander of land forces, General Mosala Monja Ndongo, reported Zairean television on Sunday.  General Mosala, a former commander of the eighth military region, in western Zaire, replaces General Malumba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zairean soldiers among thousands of refugees have been rioting in Tanzania, says Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed. In an interview published today, the Tanzanian Home Affairs Minister said the government is looking at moving them to another country. He said the government was consulting with UNHCR and ICRC. Kigoma Regional Commissioner Yusuf Makamba said the soldiers became violent when security officials went to their camp to search for stolen goods, and had injured several civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Two vessels carrying more than 800 Zairean refugees are believed to be marooned on Lake Tanganyika after running out of fuel, reports AFP. The plight of the refugees, en route to Zambia, has been reported in the Zambian state-owned Times. The paper said the Zambian government and the UNHCR were planning a rescue mission. Missionaries in the area reportedly spotted the vessels a week ago, heading south. WFP reports the influx of Zaireans into Zambia currently stands at 7,200. UNHCR and the Government of Zambia are screening the refugees and relocating them in transit centres near Kasama, about 120 kilometres south of Mpulungu. The influx is expected to continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Burundi, the government continues to set up regroupment centres. New camps are being set up in Bujumbaura Rural and Bururi provinces, the government recently announced. On February 12, national radio announced the creation of a camp near Gitaza, 35 kilometres south of Bujumbura. According to local press reports, military authorities have told those living in surrounding hills that if they failed to voluntarily register at the regroupment centre, then they would be considered rebels and treated accordingly. Local administrators say that at least 50,000 people will be under their protection at the site. The area has been a site of several confrontations between rebels and military units recently. Other new regroupment sites announced by the government are near Buyengero and Burmbi communities in Bururi. Aid workers say conditions in the regroupment camps vary considerably; there is concern about poor sanitation and disease in some of the camps.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department said the welfare organization's performance through 1985 to 1988 E.C. in its area of operation in Ganta Afeshumu Woreda of the zone has been proved to be insignificant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially the organization has singed agreement to provide the farmers with seed, fertilizer and agricultural implements but did nothing during the three years except in the first year of operation, the department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization signed agreement with government authorities in 1987 E.C.  to build six health posts but build none, Ato Mewcha G/Medhin, head of the department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the organization claims to have spent over 2 million birr for development activities in the area but the actual performance does not prove the expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization was repeatedly warned to abide by the agreement reached earlier but has failed to do so and thus a decision was passed to terminate the operations of the organization in the area which was later approved by the regional disaster prevention and preparedness bureau, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative of the organization in Adigrat said the failure to build the health posts was due to incompatibility of the budget it has allotted and the standard set by the regional health bureau.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . GREAT LAKES - Complex Emergency Situation Report No. 23 Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, February 21, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda people, who are Tutsi of Rwandan origin, settled in the Mulenge hills of South Kivu, Zaire, and the Masisi region of North Kivu, Zaire, more than 200 years ago. Sporadic ethnic violence in the Masisi region has occurred since 1959, but it again escalated in the fall of 1995 as the former Rwandan army (the ex-FAR) and the Rwandan Hutu militia (the Interahamwe) targeted the Banyarwanda in an apparent attempt to create an area of Hutu control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1996, the situation in the Uvira region of South Kivu began to resemble that of the Masisi region, as government-sanctioned harassment of Banyamulenge Tutsis intensified. On October 14, fighting broke out between the Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairian Army (FAZ) near Runingo refugee camp, in South Kivu, forcing the roughly 220,000 refugees to flee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge joined forces with other Zairian rebels to form the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (Alliance), led by Laurent Kabila. The fighting spread, moving up the eastern border of Zaire from Uvira to Bukavu, and south from Rutshuru (North Kivu) to Goma. As a result of shelling October 26 and November 1, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kibumba, Katale, and Kahindo camps, near Goma, fled south to Mugunga camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Hutu attacks from Mugunga camp on Goma town, the Alliance counter- attacked from the east on November 14, forcing the ex-FAR and Interahamwe to retreat west and compelling hundreds of thousands of refugees to return to Rwanda, while others fled north and west into Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the last three months, the Alliance has continued its advances north and south in Eastern Zaire, most recently capturing the towns of Kalemie in the south, Isiro in the north, and Shabunda, west of Bukavu. In the past week, the Alliance has sought to consolidate its gains by recruiting more boys and men into its ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Humanitarian Assistance for Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 (to date): $124,600, 277</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan refugees: From November through December 1996, 1,033,405 Rwandan refugees returned from Eastern Zaire and Tanzania to Rwanda, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Another 232,000 Rwandans are estimated to have returned from Eastern Zaire and Tanzania this year. The UNHCR claims there are up to 300,000 Rwandans stranded in Eastern Zaire, including 150,000 in Tingi-Tingi, just south of Lubutu. Tingi-Tingi recently received about 30,000 refugees from Amisi, and about 3000 new refugees are arriving daily, with others coming in from Punia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are about 125,000 others dispersed in smaller groups in South Kivu and Maniema provinces, including the 40,000 refugees who abandoned Shabunda before it was overrun by the Alliance on February 5. U.N. officials report that 25,000 of the Shabunda refugees, some Burundian, are in Kalima, 145 km east of Kindu. The whereabouts of the other 15,000 is unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also 20,000 refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have gathered in Punia, Maniema province, 80 km south of Lubutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian refugees: Of the 143,000 Burundian refugees originally in the Uvira area, some 64,000 refugees have returned to Burundi and about 13,500 have arrived in Tanzania. Between 45,000-55,000 refugees are missing, with many believed by the UNHCR to be between Fizi and Kalemie. There are about 273,000 Burundian refugees in Tanzania, and 5,100 in Rwanda. Approximately 500 Burundian refugees arrive daily in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairian refugees and internally displaced: About 70,000 Zairians have fled to Tanzania, and in Rwanda there are 13,959 Zairians who fled the Masisi region last year. About 11,500 Zairians are reported in Uganda. The UNHCR estimates that 7,000 internally displaced Zairians have abandoned Kasese for Punia. There are estimates of 19,000 IDPs in Kindu and more than 12,000 IDPs in Kisangani. As of February 18, about 4,400 Zairian refugees arrived in Mpulungu, Zambia, and 360 Zairians, including members of the FAZ, entered Kaputa province, west of Lake Tanganyika. The Government of Sudan has appealed for UNHCR aid in dealing with the 10,000 Zairian refugees it has reported in the Bazi area of Western Equatoria. As the Alliance continues its advance and the FAZ retreats, looting everything in its path, the number of displaced Zairians grows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAZ aircraft from Kisangani bombed Bukavu, Shabunda, and Walikale on February 17, killing 19 in Bukavu, 8 in Shabunda, and wounding dozens more.  There were no reports of casualties from Walikale. After the raids, thousands of civilians fled Bukavu, humanitarian workers reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 14, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan called for a halt to the militarization of Tingi-Tingi camp, after humanitarian workers there reported that the FAZ was shipping military supplies to members of the Interahamwe/ex- FAR, who are among the Rwandan refugees in the camp. Sadako Ogata, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said on February 18 that the UNHCR may have to consider flying weak refugees out of Tingi-Tingi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rwanda, the killing of foreign humanitarian workers by unknown assailants during the past month has led to the curtailment of most relief activities. On February 14, the vice-president of the Rwandan supreme court was assassinated in his home in Kigali by unknown uniformed men. On February 9, eight Rwandan civilians were killed and three were wounded when suspected ex-FAR/Interahamwe gunmen attacked a convoy of minibuses about 20 m north of Kigali. The victims were all Tutsi, their Hutu companions having been left alone by the attackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent killings of foreigners occurred on February 4, when two expatriate human rights monitors and three Rwandans working for the U.N.  Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) were shot in Karengera commune, Cyangugu prefecture. The victims were the first HRFOR staff to have been killed in Rwanda. Rwandan security forces in Cyangugu have arrested five of the suspected killers of the human rights monitors, HRFOR reported on February 17. Two other suspects were killed by Rwandan troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the killings of its staff, the U.N. announced the relocation of staff and the reduction of its operations in western Rwanda. On February 19, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) announced that it will base most of its 50 remaining delegates in Kigali and maintain limited operations throughout the country, except for Ruhengeri, where ICRC has suspended its operations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has transferred 25 delegates to Kenya, leaving a staff of six in Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 31, HRFOR reported that Hutu death squads were killing genocide survivors and witnesses in Rwanda, and that between December 1996 and January 1997, 227 genocide survivors had been killed in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 2, an unidentified assailant shot and killed a Canadian Catholic priest as he was serving communion in Kampanga parish, Kinigi commune, 20 km north of Ruhengeri town. The priest had worked almost continuously in the parish for 25 years. On January 18 in Ruhengeri town, about 100 km northwest of Kigali, three Spaniards were killed and an American was seriously wounded by gunmen. The Spaniards worked for Medicos del Mundo (MDM) and the American was with Doctors of the World, an affiliate of MDM and operating through a grant funded by USAID/BHR/OFDA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) stated that the killers belonged to the ex- FAR/Interahamwe. The press reported that two suspects arrested in connection with the MDM killings died in Government of Rwanda (GOR) custody. On January 11, about 60 armed Rwandans, attacked the hospital in Kabaya, in Gaseke commune, Gisenyi prefecture, killing one person and wounded three. On January 13 in the same prefecture, armed men destroyed a vehicle belonging to HRFOR, and elsewhere assaulted a Chinese road crew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the growing violence, the RPA began a cordon and search operation. Vice-President and Minister of Defense Paul Kagame told the BBC on January 23 that the RPA had killed 80 people in RPA cordon and search operations in Ruhengeri prefecture in mid-January. In a press conference on February 8, Kagame described the GOR's control of the security situation as &quot; sufficient,&quot; though he added it would take time before conditions returned to normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Burundi, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that typhus epidemics are sweeping through resettlement camps in Kayanza, Muramvya, rural Bujumbura, and Gitega provinces. A WHO spokesman in Nairobi noted that the forced resettlement camps lack basic sanitation, adequate food, and potable water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political/Military Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African President Nelson Mandela said on February 18 that members of the GOZ will meet with the Alliance, including Kabila, in South Africa this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. Security Council on February 18 unanimously passed a resolution that presented a peace plan for the Great Lakes region. It called for an immediate end to hostilities; the withdrawal of all external forces, including mercenaries; the reaffirmation of respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire and other states of the region; protection and security of all refugees and displaced persons, and the facilitation of access for humanitarian assistance; the rapid settlement of the crisis through dialogue and elections; and the convening of an international conference on peace, security, and development in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution follows a plan advanced by Mohammed Sahnoun, the joint U.N.- Organization of African Unity (OAU) special representative for the Great Lakes, and a Security Council statement made on February 7. As yet the contending parties have not agreed to the plan. Sahnoun has held talks with Zairian officials, including President Mobutu. He flew to Kigali on February 19 to meet with GOR officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairian Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo announced on January 20 the beginning of a counter-offensive to retake territory lost to the Alliance rebels, and issued a declaration of war against them. However, on February 3 the FAZ admitted that the rebels had captured the Lake Tanganyika port of Kalemie, about 300 km south of Uvira. There are also reports of rebel movement toward Moba, 150 km south of Kalemie and the last lake port still in GOZ control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FAZ also confirmed that the rebels have seized Watsa, 500 km north of Goma. On February 5, Shabunda fell to the rebels. Fearing the Alliance's advance across the Oso River, the 40,000 refugees in Amisi fled further west on February 7. Relief workers suspect that some children were too weak to walk the distance and have died. Most of the 40,000 have camped outside the existing Tingi-Tingi camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FAZ claims that an Ugandan plane carrying military equipment crashed in the Ruwenzori mountains in eastern Zaire on February 10, close to the Ugandan border. Ugandan President Museveni denied the FAZ's claim that the downed aircraft was Ugandan, and offered to have international observers provide independent verificiation. On February 8, Rwandan Vice-President Paul Kagame denied allegations that the RPA was actively involved in helping the Alliance rebels in Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda (ICTR) in Arusha, Tanzania, Anatole Nsengiyumva and Ferdinand Nahimana pleaded innocent to charges that they participated in planning the 1994 genocide. Nsengiyumva, then an officer in the FAR, allegedly ordered participants at a meeting to murder Tutsis.  Nahimana is the former director of Radio des Milles Collines, which urged the population to kill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tribunal has indicted 21 people, of whom 13 are in custody. In the genocide trials in Kigali, Froduald Karamira was sentenced to death on February 14 for helping to plan and undertake the genocide in 1994. He appealed the verdict. On February 18, a court in Gikongoro rendered the first acquittal of a genocide suspect on trial in Rwanda, and convicted six others to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts Zaire: After fleeing from Shabunda on February 5, 25,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees have gathered at Kalima, 80 km west of Shabunda. Local authorities have prohibited the refugees from entering Kindu, further west. Action Contre la Faim (ACF) is preparing to send water equipment to Kindu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of February 20, MSF recorded 556 cholera cases in Tingi-Tingi, 23 of them fatal. Between December 16 and mid-February at the main camp of Tingi- Tingi 1, 1,339 refugees of all ages died, 705 of them under five. Lack of sufficient food quantities continues to be a major problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP reports that its chartered Boeing 707 has made two or three rotations daily, delivering 490 MT of food and non-food items to Kisangani between February 6 and 11. This week WFP planned to begin flying an IL-76 from Mwanza, Tanzania. From Kinshasa, a BHR/OFDA assessment team reports that since February 12, a WFP-chartered DC-3 has been flying 12-16 MT of food daily from Kisangani to Tingi-Tingi. In addition, 88 trucks have transported 450 MT of food to Tingi-Tingi in the last week. Flights out of Kisangani were suspended on February 18, the day after the bombing raids, because the FAZ confiscated all jet fuel. With fueling equipment also confiscated, aircraft refueling at Kisangani must be done by hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF reports that it is targetting 20,000 children and vulnerables at the seven health centers in the Lubutu area, four of which are in Tingi-Tingi.  UNICEF runs a center for 6,000 unaccompanied children in Tingi-Tingi. MSF and Action Contre la Faim (ACF) operate supplementary feeding centers in Tingi- Tingi that are treating 2,500 children, and therapeutic feeding centers that are treating 350 children. In recent weeks, FAZ shipments of arms and ammunition to Tingi-Tingi have increased the risk of attacks on flights of humanitarian relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kisangani transit center is housing 2,500 IDPs, with another 3,000 hoping to gain entry, the BHR/OFDA assessment team reported on February 20.  Another 10,000-12,000 IDPs are dispersed throughout the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although organized repatriation is suspended in the Goma area, 185 refugees crossed into Rwanda at La Petite Barriere in Gisenyi prefecture between February 3 and 9, WFP reports. On February 11, the Alliance requested assistance from relief organizations in Bukavu to help move refugees in Kengulube, south of Shabunda, to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR, the International Rescue Committee (IRC), Save the Children Fund (SCF/UK), ICRC, Oxfam, and CARE sent a convoy to find the refugees. The team, meeting great logistical difficulties, transported 40 vulnerable refugees to Rwanda. Three died en route. The relief committee will try to establish way stations to assist refugees in reaching Rwanda, but poor road conditions will require all supplies to be portaged. On February 10, the ICRC reopened its office in Uvira. The ICRC is also assisting IDPs in Kalemie, to the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda: The UNHCR reports that 1,300,582 refugees returned to Rwanda in 1996, and this year, about 232,000 refugees have returned from Zaire and Tanzania. In contrast to the 16,971 refugees who returned to Rwanda from South Kivu between January 20 to 26, only 1,675 refugees returned between January 27 and February 2, WFP reports. The reduction is widely believed to be related to the renewed fighting in Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January, WFP provided 15,400 MT of cereals, pulses, and oil, for distribution to returnees. WFP field monitors are planning to work with GOR Commune Distribution Committees, which have begun to take over food distributions from NGOs throughout Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need for permanent shelter poses a major concern for the GOR, which estimates that there is a need for 200,000-250,000 homes nationwide. On January 28, the GOR called a meeting to announce it would undertake a new resettlement policy, involving &quot;group settlements&quot; of houses. The GOR stated that genocide survivors had also asked to be settled in groups for security reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi: The USAID/BHR/OFDA Emergency Disaster Relief Coordinator (EDRC) travelled on Highway One during February 12-13. The road links the capital to Kayanza province, which borders Rwanda. Although he saw some farmers at work, many fields appeared abandoned. He saw commercial and private traffic on the road, but fewer bicyclists transporting produce than in the past. There were signs of wanton destruction to buildings in Bugarama and Teza. In Kayanza, the EDRC visited three resettlement camps, two of them formed last month, Although the provincial governor told the EDRC that the camps were temporary, he did not say when the army would allow residents to move closer to their homes. At Buraniro camp, children appeared healthy and people were cultivating nearby fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From February 3 to 9, the WFP distributed 1,234 MT of food to 98,173 people in Burundi. Most of the recipients have lived in resettlement camps since 1996. Kigoma port storage facilities are full; consequently, WFP truck convoys from Ngara, Tanzania, to Ngozi have risen from once to three times weekly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania: The GOT has declared that those Rwandan refugees from the Tanzanian camps who did not repatriate, and who are now hiding, will be considered illegal aliens. The UNHCR has started demolishing 47,000 huts in five camps in Karagwe, where Rwandan refugees had stayed until last December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 15-16, 2,725 Zairians entered Tanzania. As of February 15, there were about 335,134 refugees in Tanzania, of whom about 70,000 were Zairian, and the rest Burundian. In the Ngara camps, there are 105,000 refugees; of the total, 59,000 are in Lukole camp, with the remainder in the former Lumasi camp, now called Lukole C. On February 19, the GOT announced it would turn over to the UNHCR 211 FAZ armed troops who fled to Kigoma last week. In the Kigoma region, there are 240,134 refugees: the Nduta camp has 14, 783; Nyarugusu has 44,197 Zairians; Lugufu, 90 km east of Kigoma town, opened on February 15 and will have a capacity of 200,000; Muyovosi has 40,188 refugees; Mtabila has 24,182. As of February 15, there were 22,404 refugees, of whom about 90% are Zairian, in holding areas in Kigoma town. Tanzania is receiving about 1,000 Zairian and 500 Burundian refugees daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 26, BHR/OFDA deployed a USAID/DART to Kigali, Rwanda, to conduct assessments, report on the situation, and provide funding to NGOs, U.N.  agencies, and international organizations for programs to assist in repatriation efforts. On November 7, 1996, U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda Robert Gribbin declared a disaster, noting that the refugee crisis in eastern Zaire posed a humanitarian emergency for Rwanda. On November 12, U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson declared a disaster in Zaire as a result of the violent break- up of refugee camps in eastern Zaire. On November 18, the USG pledged $140 million in humanitarian and development assistance to address needs in the Great Lakes region. On November 25, Ambassador Morris Hughes declared a disaster in Burundi as a result of continuing civil strife. On February 12, BHR/OFDA deployed an assessment team in Zaire, to evaluate relief needs in the GOZ-controlled areas of Eastern Zaire. Insecurity has prevented the team from travelling outside Kinshasa. The team is collecting information on eastern Zaire by meeting daily with NGOs and U.N. agencies in the capital.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Commission this afternoon completed a two-day meeting, the first day of which was attended by additional members of the TRC's three standing committees. The meeting began yesterday with the Chairperson outlining his vision for the rest of the Commission's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following are among our decisions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Amnesty Committee</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have agreed in principle to ask Parliament to enlarge the Amnesty Committee to help it through its workload. The proposal is to add enough members to enable the Committee to hold two hearings in different places at the same time, and for some members to consider applications in chambers.  Final details of the proposal have still to be worked out. Possibilities that will be discussed include appointing members from among the Commission's members and appointing additional members. We have still to make a formal proposal to Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Amnesty Committee reported that we have received 5,200 amnesty applications so far. However, this is not indicative of the Committee's likely workload: a few thousand - the final total is not yet established - have been and will be dealt with administratively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Effect of the Appellate Division's judgement on notice of hearings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a consequence of the Appellate Division's judgement to the effect that we give proper, reasonable and timeous notice to those who may be detrimentally implicated or prejudicially affected at hearings, we will re- introduce with immediate effect the practice of giving alleged perpetrators advance notice that they could be named in hearings. They will receive witnesses statements and/or other relevant documentation to enable them to identify the events, incidents and persons which the evidence concerns.  However, we will not necessarily disclose the identity of witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our aim is to send notices out 21 days in advance of hearings. This will result in the postponement of the next two Human Rights Violations Committee hearings - in the Northern Province and in the Eastern Cape - to enable adequate notice to be given. The effect on hearings themselves has still to be judged but the new procedure will undoubtedly be more time-consuming and increase the Commission's workload.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Statement-taking project</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission is poised to announce a major drive to gather new statements from victims of gross violations of human rights. Until now most of the 7,700 statements made to the TRC have been collected by our own statement-takers.  Our intention this year is to re-deploy resources to intensify the statement- taking process, and - most important - to launch a Designated Statement Taking Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the DST Project, we will use R2,4 million in donor funding to involve Non-Governmental Organisations in an extensive programme to gather statements from people in communities around the country. We will sign agreements with NGOs, the objectives of which are outlined in the attached form. We will also organise training programmes for designated statement-takers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Presentation by Mlungisi Hlongwane, Sanco President, 23 February 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INTRODUCTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To define the nature of our gathering today is a dilemma that is too clear to be confused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President of the ANC is a national patron of SANCO and a card carrying member of the same organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constituency we represent overlaps. Perhaps it explains whey the ANC is the largest political liberation movement, and SANCO is the largest organ of civil society representing communities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically we are compelled today to meet with a soul objective to eradicate tensions between the two formations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are there really tensions between the two formations, what is the nature of these tensions and what are the courses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This submit therefore intends to examine these tensions and mop the road ahead to consolidate these tensions for the good of all South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHERE DO WE COME FROM HISTORY OF SANCO/ANC RELATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our history can not be drawn by our detractors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We come from the history where we jointly destroyed apartheid. Whilst the ANC concentrated on the other pillars of our struggle; namely mass mobilisation, international isolation of apartheid and armed struggle we in SANCO through civic bodies throughout the country enhanced vigorously the war against apartheid racist local authorities and combined forces through all available peaceful methods of advancing our revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can not be separated. Our history cemented a political bond that can not separated by chemical substances such as those who want to help us to define our constitution; independence and autonomy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are independent enough to know who we should be independent from. We are autonomous enough to know which political force would contaminate our vision.  We are an independent organ of civil society, independent from government, political parties and other civil organs. We take independent decisions on the timing of our relaxing our independents to advance the course of the poor to ensure peace and prosperity in our country. Yet we must face it some of our structures are at loggerheads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATURE OF SANCO/ANC CONFLICTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is embarrasing to acknowledge that whilst we share a common programme of reconstruction and development. We share common policies fundamental to the objectives and cornerstones of the two organisations. Some of our structures and members are drawing daggers and are at each other throats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have no political or philosophical differences with the ANC. Our differences emerge as a result of the two organisations desire to transform South Africa. Eastern Cape is a case in point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- We fight over who should be a councillor. - We fight over who should initiate or lead development. - We fight over consultation. Especially when the ANC in government adopt an economic blue that becomes non-negotiable. - We fight over tariffs at local level. - We fight over recognition and respect of each others strengths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these causes reflect the pattern of conflict at various levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is political about these conflicts or differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must however acknowledge, that some causes of these differences are personalities and ambitions we are deliberately translated into political differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is disturbing that some of our senior leaders have jumped into this band- wagon of political maturity that enhances the objectives of opportunists from both organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call for SANCO to disband must come to an end. What does this call in political terms mean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battles at local level between our organisation must be eradicated.  Disciplinary measures against those who perpetuate division must be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal behaviour and political dishonesty must be removed from our leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE ONGOING CRISIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This summit sits at a correct time to diffuse what could have been suicidal for the Alliance and development in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whilst SANCO remained steadfast in its pronouncement of civic orientation with no intentions to stand for elections at any level, many of our locals where gearing themselves to review policy and to challenge national leadership on its stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MASAKHANE cannot succeed without the involvement of those culprit who committed progressive crimes through boycotts, leading the end of such boycotts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May I use this opportunity to announce that those who thought are now comfortable in government who are formally SANCO veterans you will no longer have an excuse. SANCO in its National General Council over the weekend to a decision to open the contents of its leadership position to all its members irrespective of their links within governments. Lechesa Kgabs, Max Mamase and many more. You are now called upon to remedy the mess you caused during years of boycotts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- It is the challenge facing both organisations to transform South Africa to an poverty, homelessness, crime and achieve economic growth. - We will continue to differ because we are not one organisation. - We will defer on traditional leaders as we did in the past. - We will argue and differ on consultation and decision making. - Like COSATU and the SACP we will challenge the ANC on privatisation and the economic strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However our revolutionary objective should not be obstructed or deviated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us respect our independence and autonomy. SANCO must be given the recognition deserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us plan for the next elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCLUSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May I thank the leadership of ANC and SANCO for honouring and taking these issues seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our organisations are not in crises. We not restructuring in disguise to expel leaders. Our house is in order. Our political vision and foresight remains acute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues that will be resolved by the summit must be implemented without fail, we can afford a political breakdown between major formations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do not need a GNU constitution to govern our relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are part of one liberation movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A family of revolutionaries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - KIDNAPPED BABY FOUND: Timothy Funnell, the toddler at the centre of what is believed to be Malawi's first kidnap case of its kind was found on 18 February, abandoned in the veld, unharmed except for mosquito bites. He was spotted by chance by two passing boys. Malawi police are questioning several suspects in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen month old Timothy, adopted son of a missionary couple, Barry and Julia Funnels, was abducted from their home in a Blantyre suburb, Sigerege, adjacent to Chilomoni Township. The kidnap was described as brutal, with the attackers beating the missionary, then grabbing the baby upside down, banging his head against a pot plant as they fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The baby, at the centre of an adoption case row which reached the South African Constitutional Court, was kidnapped on February 15, just a fortnight after a major court ruling that the adoption procedures had been unconstitutional. Timothy was adopted by paraplegic missionary Barry Funnell and his wife after his biological mother, violinist Adri Naude of South Africa decided she did not want the child, fathered by her former boyfriend, Lawrie Fraser. Fraser wanted custody of the child and took his case to court, winning a decision that adoption laws discriminate against unmarried fathers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* FLOODS LEAVE 50 000 HOMELESS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks of very heavy rains in Malawi have left some 50 000 families homeless, the government announced this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 30 000 Malawians from the Nsanje district on the Mozambique border have been joined by some 20 000 Mozambicans trying to escape the floods. The floods have washed away bridges, hampering relief efforts, and even helicopters have been kept back by continuing storms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local newspapers report that residents have been sheltering on rooftops and in trees, and have no food. Malawi lacks the infrastructure to provide airdrop relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* IN LAW SUES CHIPEMBERE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Chipembere, a brother to the late Henry Masauko Chipembere, prominent politician who rebelled against the former president's dictatorial rule during a 1964 cabinet crisis, has sued his brother's widow, Catherine, accusing her of abusing the Chipembere family name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The High Court in Blantyre started hearing submissions on the case in which John argues that his sister-in-law was abusing their clan name by continuing to be known as Mrs Chipembere after a part payment of lobola (bride price) had been made. John argues that by customary practice, by virtue of the payment, Catherine, who was widowed 21 years ago, has remarried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catherine, 61, nee Ambali, from Likoma Island in Nkhata-Bay, north Malawi, is deputy minister of health and population in the present government. She won a parliamentary seat in 1994 in Mangochi on the strength of her late husband's name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her wedding with Alford Marama, which was supposed to have taken place at Christmas last year, was put on ice after the Chipembere family cried foul against her continued use of the clan name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chipembere family say they have no objection to her remarrying as long as she refrains from using the family name. Justice Eric Kumitsonyo is presiding over the case. Both parties have hired private lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* TAX INCREASE THIS YEAR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government intends to introduce new taxes this year in order to finance the implementation of salary increments awarded civil servants. The new taxes, to be introduced during the next budget session of parliament in March, are expected to mostly affect local business companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to information leaked from the Finance ministry, the hardest hit will be the transport sector with road hauliers expected to pay high taxes on transportation of all goods. One of the new taxes is the introduction of duty on truck imports which had been duty free. In addition, transporters will now also pay 20 percent of the total cost of the transported goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to ministry sources, government had waived the incentive it gave transporters to bring in trucks, called horses duty free, to boost the transport sector in Malawi. Local transporters have been meeting this week to work out a strategy to counter the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* TELEVISION IN MALAWI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Malawi Television, with its launching a year behind schedule, has finally found a partner from Europe which is expected to acquire at least 40 percent of the shares in the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman of the project, Steve Mijiga, who is also Chief Executive of Malawi Posts and Telecommunications, said in an interview that the European partner, whom he could not disclose at the moment because a contract was yet to be signed between the two firms, had vast experience in television broadcasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The contract will be signed in April this year,&quot; said Mijiga. He said that it would be a useful partnership that would translate as a transfer of technology and knowledge from Europe to Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi Television was originally scheduled to have started beaming programmes in March last year, in partnership with a Malaysian private television firm which was also to supply equipment and provide technical expertise and training to the local staff. But TV Malawi later announced it had withdrawn from the partnership because the Malaysian firm wanted to sell Malawi old and substandard equipment. It did, however, say at the time, the project would go ahead with or without a partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said viewers would start tuning in to TVM before June this year in Blantyre and later the service would reach out to other districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. K500m SWITCHING EQUIPMENT TO IMPROVE TELECOM SERVICES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi and Japan on February 11 signed a K500 million (US$ 33.3 million) contract aimed at improving telecommunication switching and transmission services in the country. Chief Executive of Malawi Posts and Telecommunications, Steve Mijiga, speaking at the signing ceremony, said the money would help revamp the ageing telecommunications equipment, some of which has been in use for 50 years. He said the old equipment would be replaced with new efficient digital exchange equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the contract, Mitsui, a Japanese company, will install 40,000 telephone lines, 34,000 of them distributed between the capital Lilongwe and Dedza, Salima Dwangwa and Nkhota-kota in the centre with the remaining 6,000 earmarked for installation in Machinga and Zomba in south Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contract is being funded jointly by the African Development Bank and Malawi Posts and Telecoms. ADB is pumping in US$34 million while MPTC's contribution is US$10 million. Mijiga said part of the funding will be used for installing radio transmission equipment and optical fibre links for efficient radio services between Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mzuzu and Zomba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MPTC is planning to install an additional 10,000 telephone lines soon to Thyolo, Mulanje Chikwawa and Nsanje in south Malawi in a move to help boost the tea, sugar cane and cotton industries,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Installation work is expected to start in September this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* WANDERERS WHITEWASHED IN LESOTHO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telecom Wanderers were on February 16 massacred 5-1 by Lesotho's Roma Rovers in the second leg of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Champions Cup in Maseru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bata Bullets, however, playing against Kiyovu of Rwanda in Kigali sailed through to the next round of the CAF's Winners' Cup after losing 2-1. Bata's win is based on the strength of an away goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Bata and Wanderers won 1-0 each against their rivals two weeks ago in Blantyre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have beaten us clean,&quot; was a better summary of the game from MBC commentator Steve Liwewe Banda about the game between Wanderers and Roma.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - British High Commissioner to Malawi, John Martin, on February 18 asked Malawian politicians and the general public to be patient and not to expect speedy results from the police reform programme his government is funding. Martin said this in Blantyre during the official closing of a trainers course attended by 52 policemen some of whom have been trained to train other policemen in the reform programme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He advised Malawians to be very patient and to give police enough time to reform effectively. He said, understandably, a lot of people including politicians and the general public, would like to see speedy results from the reform programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But change, if it is to be anything more than artificial, cannot be achieved quickly,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reform programme, according to Martin has for the past two years been devoted to developing a new democratic culture to the Malawi police personnel.  &quot;Individual police officers must feel empowered to take routine decisions without referring them up through the hierarchy all the way to the Inspector General of Police,&quot; said Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of the 52 policemen, 12 were trained by a team of policemen from Surrey Police in Britain who in turn trained the other 40.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - Following her visit to the Great Lakes last week, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said that she felt security had improved in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our aim is to reach a stable situation where we can organize repatriation to all the provinces in Burundi. We're not there yet, but we may be soon.&quot; She told reporters that over 92,000 Burundians who had sought refuge in Zaire had already returned to Burundi since October, 1996. Over 72,000 of them have returned to their home province of Cibitoke. After meeting with Ms. Ogata in Ngozi, President Buyoya condemned the massacre of 122 Burundian refugees who were expelled from Tanzania last month, and said that the six soldiers and a customs officer who were charged with the massacre would be tried by a military court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A military court in Bururi February 16 sentenced four Burundian soldiers to up to ten years in prison for their role in two separate massacres in the communities of Manana and Kizuka in Bururi province. Approximately 40 civilians were killed in Matana last November, while several dozen people were killed in Kizuka in December, a military spokesman said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement released to coincide with a scheduled February 13 meeting of the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee (RSCC), the Burundian Foreign Ministry reiterated its appeal for the lifting of &quot;suffocating&quot; sanctions against the country. In a statement released as regional leaders gathered in Zambia to discuss the embargo, the Foreign Ministry said that Burundi had been &quot;suffering from a total blockade for seven months that was imposed unjustly and illegally by neighbouring countries.&quot; The statement added that exemptions for selected humanitarian goods had not been respected and that the embargo was having &quot;perverse effects&quot; by hitting the most disadvantaged populations in the country hardest. Although representatives from Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Zaire and Zambia, reportedly met in Lusaka for two days, no public statement was issued. There are indications that the RSCC has agreed to allow humanitarian organizations to import additional limited fuel supplies. However, no further details were available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the CNDD, the political wing of the FDD rebel movement, issued a statement from its Nairobi office saying that the sanctions had been repeatedly violated and should be tightened. It also called for financial, political, material and military support for the CNDD &quot;because only the military actions of the CNDD will force the military junta to accept true negotiations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Center for Human Rights in Burundi is facing increasingly strident criticism of its operations and reporting by the Prime Minister and other top officials of the Buyoya government. On February 13, the Prime Minister's office issued a public statement accusing the Center of circulating unsubstantiated allegations of human rights abuses by the Burundian government, and added that the reports contained partisan political opinions.  The statement concluded that authors of the reports were being politically manipulated by forces hostile to the government. It added that the human rights mission would be held responsible for the &quot;enormous prejudices resulting from the publication of reports containing non-verifiable allegations. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation issued a second statement accusing the Center of violating its mandate, and working to discredit the government. In addition to a paragraph-by-paragraph refutation of alleged governmental human rights abuses contained in the Center's December human rights report, the statement repeated that the Center would be held responsible for any backlash that its reports might cause. The Center for Human Rights has temporarily suspended all fact-finding trips outside of Bujumbura and has taken additional security precautions in light of the government's reaction to the report. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso is expected to visit Burundi February 19 to seek confirmation of continued Burundian government support for the Center's activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. SECURITY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from both official and humanitarian sources indicate that security has improved in much of the country over the last month, enhancing humanitarian agencies access to vulnerable populations. However, engagements between rebel and military forces continue, especially in the vicinity of the Kibira forest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since last year's forced closure of the refugee camps in eastern Zaire, the rebel offensive has suffered major setbacks. Despite the apparent lull in rebel attacks, the Burundian military continues to draft thousands of new soldiers of both sexes. Drafted soldiers can be seen training daily on the streets of Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are unconfirmed reports of sporadic fighting throughout the week near Isare in Bujumbura Rural. Military operations also continue east of Rugombo in Cibitoke province, preventing humanitarian organizations from reaching Mugina commune which has a large number of returnees. In Rugera Commune in Bubanza province, there were reports of gunfire throughout the night of February 14. The number of casualties is unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. AFFECTED POPULATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts by the Burundian government to set up regroupment centers continue.  Over the past ten days, the government has announced that it is in the process of setting up new camps in Bujumbura Rural and Bururi provinces. On February 12, a government spokesman on national radio announced the creation of a camp near Gitaza, 35 km south of Bujumbura. According to local press reports, military authorities have told those living in surrounding hills that if they failed to voluntarily register at the regroupment center, than they would be considered to be rebels and treated accordingly. Local administrators say that at least 50,000 people will be under their protection at the site. The area has been site of several confrontations between rebels and military units in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has also announced the creation of two additional sites with a total population of 6,000 inhabitants near the communities of Buyengero and Burambi in Bururi. In addition to Bujumbura Rural and Bururi, the provinces of Muramvya, Kayanza and Karuzi all have known regroupment centers.  Conditions in the centers vary from site to site and are somewhat dependent on policies of local administrators. Populations at some sites have regular access to health care facilities and other basic amenities as well as relative freedom to enter and leave the sites either to work in their fields or for other reasons. Populations at other sites, however, are under greater control and have access to only very limited facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF reports that 94 cases of severe diarrhea were treated in health centers in the towns of Cibitoke and Rugombo in Cibitoke province between January 18 and February 8. Cholera is suspected but unconfirmed. There is a serious lack of potable water in the province , and cholera epidemics were reported in Cibitoke in 1970 and 1991. To help prevent new cases, UNICEF has provided local officials in the province with water purification tablets to be distributed to the affected population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi's Ministry of Public Health is mobilizing teams to combat a typhus epidemic in Muramvya and Kayanza provinces. According to the World Health Organization office in Burundi, a total of 222 cases of the disease have been confirmed between January 16 and January 31 in displaced sites scattered throughout the two provinces. On average, there were roughly 118 cases over each two week period in 1996, roughly half the number of new cases now being recorded. With WHO support, the Ministry of Public Health is sending teams to distribute antibiotics and to educate members or the population on measures it can take to avoid contracting the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A DHA assessment mission to Kayanza province, conducted in conjunction with USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, visited the regroupment camps of Buraniro (pop. 14,000), Ninga (pop. 11,300) and Nyarurama (pop. 17,000) All three camps have a small number of old caseload Tutsi displaced, as well as a larger number of more recently arrived displaced Hutu. The mission found that living conditions in the three camps (out of the six regroupment centers known to exist in the province) varied considerably. There were no visible signs of acute malnutrition in any of the camp. In all three camps, fresh food was widely available and residents were observed bringing in produce from their fields. Local authorities indicated that the residents of all three camps lacked seeds, fertilizer and farm tools, but had access to their fields from two to five days a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to UNICEF, approximately 3,000 Burundians are in Salukwango near Kalima in eastern Zaire. They are mixed in with a population of 10,000 refugees who are at the site, most of whom are Rwandans. UNICEF reports that the general condition of the refugees in very bad. UNICEF and UNHCR are both providing assistance to the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reports that over the last five days, between 100 to 200 Burundians have returned to the country each day from camps in Tanzania. From February 1 to February 15, 1,928 Burundian refugees from Tanzania returned to the country, the majority from the Lumasi camp near Ngara. During the entire month of January, 974 refugees returned to Burundi from Zaire, with a similar number returning during the month of December. UNHCR officials say they are unsure why there has been a sudden upsurge in returnees from Tanzania.  Burundians from the former camps in eastern Zaire also continue to return to the country but at a more constant level. For the past three weeks, approximately 450 per week have returned through the Gatumba transit Center northwest of Bujumbura..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Vision reports that its emergency surgery clinic in Bujumbura is performing an average of 100 surgical operations per month. The staff routinely conducts abdominal, orthopaedic and other major operations. World Vision also operates a health clinic and medical laboratory in Bujumbura staffed by 20 professionals who conduct over 1,000 consultations per month.  Among other activities, the NGO is also training social workers in three provinces and conducting tracing programs for recently unaccompanied children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam-Quebec reports that it is continuing its efforts to train youth craft- making and other marketable skills in three training centers in Bujumbura.  The NGO is also distributing seeds in Bujumbura Rural and Cibitoke provinces, and distributing food and non-food relief items to both displaced and recent returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian Cooperation Agency provides $2.5 million to UN agencies and NGOs in Burundi. Among other activities, the agency is supporting the rehabilitation of schools, the rehabilitation of health centers and the construction of sanitation systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. COORDINATION OF HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joint WFP, FAO, UNICEF and DHA operation to evaluate populations and conditions in displaced camps in nine provinces began February 18. The information will be updated as regularly as possible to ensure that trends and conditions of affected populations are monitored closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Correction: The February 5 - 12 Situation Report incorrectly stated that ethnic origin of affected populations would be included in the evaluation.  This is not the case.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. EFFECTS OF SANCTIONS ON OPERATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supplies of Jet A-1 fuel at Bujumbura airport, used for WFP's internal flights, remain extremely limited. Those supplies that remain at the airport are not under the direct control of WFP and can be requisitioned by the government at any time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Kigoma port closed to barge traffic to and from Burundi, road transport remains the only means of importing sanctions-exempted goods. WFP reports that it will increase truck convoys from Ngara, Tanzania to Ngozi from once to three times per week which will allow WFP to import the maximum 2,500 mt of food allowed by the RSCC. Over the past two weeks, goods for FAO, UNDP and Christian Aid were transported to Burundi as part of the WFP convoy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - A five-day conference on the Nile River basin opened Monday in Addis Ababa at which the 10 riparian states are expected to spell out their positions on the use on the resources of the River Nile and hopefully forge closer cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 5th Nile 2002 conference has brought together at least 250 government representatives and researchers from the 10 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also taking part are researchers on the Nile from Africa and elsewhere in the world, representatives of international organizations such as the World Bank, UNDP, the European Union and donor countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the conference, Ethiopia's minister for water resources, Shiferaw Jarso, said since Ethiopia contributed 86 percent of the Nile's waters the country had the right to its equitable share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the exercise of its sovereign right to the utilization of its waters, Ethiopia reserves the right to make use of the Blue Nile waters,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However in so doing, he said, Ethiopia has no intention of causing &quot; appreciable or significant harm to other riparian states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 10 riparian states are Burundi, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire. With a total population of 250 million, they have an area of about three million square kilometers, which is equivalent to about one third of the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These countries have been holding annual consultations since 1993. These meetings are aimed at the utilization of the Nile waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Position papers by governments are presented at these annual meetings as well as technical and scientific papers within the region and from abroad.  The formal gatherings are expected to end, by the year 2002, with an agreement on &quot;basis of cooperation&quot; for the utilization of the Nile by all, in line with the United Nations international protocol on cross-border rivers.  This is now at the drafting stage, according to the organizers of the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a bilateral treaty of 1959, Egypt and Sudan decided to share the total 84 billion cubic meters of the Nile waters, excluding other countries.  Egypt was allotted 55.5 billion cubic meters of water, with 18.5 billion cubic meters going to Sudan, and the remaining 10 billion cubic meters left unexploited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nile 2002 conference had been held in Egypt (1993), Sudan (1994), Tanzania (1995) and Uganda (1996).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Alleged homosexual activities of former Zimbabwean President Rev. Canaan Banana, with his ex-aide-de-camp, were made bare in the High Court on Monday with a judge recommending investigations into the sodomy practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one is seen to be above the law,&quot; High Court Judge Justice Bartlett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sodomy is a criminal offence in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Police Inspector Jefta Dube told the court that he was homosexually abused by Banana at State House, the official residence of the president, from 1983 to 1986.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartlett, who sentenced Dube to 10 years in prison for the 1995 murder of a police constable during a music concert at Gwanzura Stadium in Harare, said the allegations could not be dismissed as not being &quot;reasonably possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge found Dube guilty of murder with actual intent but with diminished responsibility after relying on the evidence of two psychiatrists who testified that the accused suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dube had also given his evidence &quot;clearly&quot; on how he was haunted by his forced homosexual escapades with Banana resulting in his excessive intake of alcohol and drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Bartlett said that stress, coupled with Dube's drug and heavy drinking, could not be ruled out as contributing to his three-year subjection to sodomy by Banana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That evidence was corroborated by former Senior Assistant Police Commissioner John Chademana. He testified that Dube had reported to his police superiors that Banana was sodomizing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dube also complained to retired army and Air Force of Zimbabwe commanders Solomon Mujuru and Josiah Tungamirai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chademana testified that Dube's report, which culminated in his being granted audience with Vice President Simon Muzenda (then deputy prime minister), came in the wake of numerous intelligence reports about Banana's &quot; homosexual activities from many parts of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Bartlett described corroborative evidence by Patience Mleya, Dube's aunt, as being a &quot;transparently honest feeling of the helplessness of the accused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Bartlett said that Dube's evidence could not be rejected as not being &quot;unreasonably possible.&quot; The court could have been better placed to make a factual finding if the state had summoned Banana to give evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dube described how he awoke in State House one morning after being apparently drugged to find his trousers off, sperms between his legs and Banana telling him, &quot;We have helped ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The serving president, Robert Mugabe, has unwaveringly criticized homosexuals perverts and sodomites, saying they were &quot;worse than dogs and pigs&quot; and undeserving of rights of any kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A prominent international statesman Banana, 61, was Zimbabwe's first black president at independence in 1980. He is married with four children and is currently a professor of theology at the University of Zimbabwe. He retired as Zimbabwean president in 1987 to pave way for Mugabe (then prime minister) following the introduction of the executive presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dube shot and killed the Police Constable Patrick Mashure at the musical concert in September 1995 after the deceased had questioned him on why he was urinating in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His defence was that Mashure had provoked him by asking: &quot;Iwe ngochani mukadzi wa Banana urikutundireyi ipapo (Shona vernacular for, &quot;hey you homosexual and wife of Banana why are you urinating there?).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mind, befuddled with alcohol and marijuana compounded the trauma from the alleged homosexual scenes with Banana, Dube drew his pistol and shot Mashure in the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocate Byron Hove, who said while it was his client's wish to have Banana investigated for sodomy, told the court that Dube would sue the former president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Bartlett granted Dube leave to appeal against conviction and sentence after the lawyer successfully argued that the conviction &quot;goes against the weight of the evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartlett also said that the two psychiatrists should treat Dube for post- traumatic stress disorder.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GABORONE, Botswana (PANA) - A two-day Commonwealth meeting on democracy began Monday with an appeal to the leaders of its African members to focus on issues of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-day Round Table on Democracy and Good Governance, between African ruling and opposition parties, will discuss the essential and universal ingredients of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resolutions of the meeting will be presented Wednesday to the heads of states' two-day retreat in the northern Botswana town of Kasane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit is expected to be attended by the presidents of Botswana, Gambia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Other representatives will be sent by Cameroon, Ghana, Lesotho, Namibia, Seychelles, Swaziland and Uganda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the meeting, Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoko urged both the ruling and opposition parties to work together to consolidate democracy in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope that in your deliberations you will pay particular attention to the discussing the essential and the universal ingredients of democracy and consider the structure and processes, including the constitutions, needed to support democracy and develop a democratic culture,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other factors which had to be assessed, he said, were the proper relations between the ruling and the opposition parties and move away from the &quot;winner take all&quot; politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to examine the impediments in the way of democracy in Africa, whether ethnicity or religion, the denial of human rights or the politics of exclusion,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Zimbabwe Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge, who chairs the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group on the Harare Declaration, said Monday that the body, which met in London early February, resolved that Gambia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone must speed up measures to embrace democratic principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing journalists in Harare, Mudenge said following its visits to the three countries, the group discovered that the countries had partially implemented the recommendations of the declaration but that violations of human rights were still evident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said while Nigeria, which was suspended from the Commonwealth in 1995 for the execution of writer Ken Saro Wiwa and other political opponents, had made great strides in improving its human rights record, it still continued to detain opponents without trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministerial group, he said, also noted that the continued exclusion of a significant part of the Gambia's civilian leadership from the political life of the country continued to be detrimental to the cause of democracy in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the meantime, the group welcomed the conclusion of the electoral phase of the transition in the Gambia marked by the parliamentary elections&quot; of January 2, 1997, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministerial group was formed in 1995 as Commonwealth mechanism for dealing with serious or persistent violations of the declaration principles arrived at in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, Anyaoko was quoted from London as saying participants hope to evaluate the state of Africa's fledgling democracies and &quot;consider the best way forward&quot; for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is hoped that the best practice will rub off and bad practice will be exposed for what it is,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, he said was &quot;unique&quot; and part of the Commonwealth's continued efforts to give greater support to the democratic process in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa still has autocratic regimes but it has made progress over the past decade in planting the seeds of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1990, nine African Commonwealth states were governed by military regimes or dictatorships. Now, only Nigeria remains. It was suspended from the organization because of its human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's white minority regime gave way to a multiparty democracy in April 1994, resulting in the election of Nelson Mandela as president and his African National Congress as the governing party in an multiracial democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the praise of the international community, countries such as Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique and Uganda also held relatively peaceful democratic polls after 1990, while Angola recently ended a decades-long civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the negative side, the ministerial group, last week, expressed &quot;serious doubts&quot; about the credibility of Gambia's presidential poll in September 1996.  It was won by Yahya Jammeh who, as an army lieutenant, sized power in a July 1994 coup.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - The Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity, Salim Ahmed Salim, has reaffirmed Africa's support for, and solidarity with, Libya which has had to cope with the air, diplomatic and military sanctions imposed on her by the United Nations Security Council since 1992, over the Lockerbie affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All African states have called for an end to the sanctions imposed on Libya and for a peaceful settlement of the Lockerbie crisis in conformity with international law,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim was giving a news conference Sunday in Tripoli where he is attending the 65th annual meeting of the organization's Council of Ministers. The four- day meeting began Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the OAU and the Arab League were discussing measures to settle this crisis. He did not elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think it is time to lift the sanctions imposed on Tripoli in view of the several positive steps taken by Tripoli towards the peaceful settlement of this affair,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The holding of the meeting in Tripoli, he said, clearly attested to the level of African support for Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim also called for urgent action by African countries to resolve all conflicts such as the crisis in the Great Lakes region and other inter- African conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization has a department -- the O.A.U. Organ For Conflict Resolution, Prevention and Management -- charged with this task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said that Africa's strength lay in the unity of its peoples who now have to meet all challenges in a rapidly changing world, which leaves room only for big economic blocs and large political groupings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appealed for the settlement of all ethnic problems and conflicts plaguing the continent through mechanisms established by Africans. If not, he said, Africa's development would be compromised.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - The 65th ministerial council session of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) opened Monday in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, with a preparatory meeting of ambassadors and other plenipotentiaries of the 53-member body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Focusing on pressing political, economic and social issues bedeviling Africa, it is the first time the council meeting is being held outside the organization's headquarters in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, officials of the organization say, is in solidarity with Libya, which is under a United States-sponsored United Nations sanctions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fourth ambassadorial meeting precedes the Ministerial Council session, which begins Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top on the agenda is the situation in Africa's Great Lakes region, the conflict in Burundi, Liberia, Somalia and the U.N. sanctions on Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional economic integration, to be achieved through the African Economic Community, agreements on border trade and inter-African economic cooperation are some of the other agenda topics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his report covering the period June 1996 to February 1997, the O.A.U.  secretary general, Salim Ahmed Salim, said there was need for a redoubling of efforts at solving the problems that hindered Africa's political and socio- political progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting is also considering the O.A.U's budgetary matters in relation to the arrears of 56.2 million U.S. dollars owed by member states in assessed contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial crisis facing the dakar-based Pan African News Agency, PANA, an O.A.U organ, is also listed for discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his introductory remarks, Salim noted that non-payment of contributions by O.A.U. member states was frustrating tangible efforts at making PANA financially autonomous through the UNESCO recovery plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agenda also includes a number of legal and financial issues to be reviewed by expert committees in addition to items proposed by member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the first major conference in the Libyan capital since the O.A.U.'s twice postponed summit in 1982 over the lack of a quorum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Libyan authorities are making great political capital of the event in the elaborate preparations, apparently to compensate delegates who have endured the inconvenience of a tedious journey to Tripoli because of the U.N.  air embargo on the North African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Green Square, commemorating the great Al-Fateh revolution, and other landmarks in the Libyan capital are wearing a new look welcoming delegates to the O.A.U. meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pro-government press has hailed the meeting as prove of the &quot;confidence the African states are putting in the Great Jamahiriya and recognition of its pioneering role in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Predictions of a tourism boom, coupled with hopes of quick returns, have led to a mushrooming of guesthouses and bed-and-breakfast establishments in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether you call it informal, specialised or alternative accommodation, the phenomenon has translated into one of the country's fastest growing industries, with the Western Cape leading the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry experts believe hoteliers have reason for concern at the trend, which seems to be supported by reports of lower occupancy by some hotel groups in the past season.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the city alone, the number of guesthouses and B &amp; Bs is believed to have tripled in the past year to more than 500 And the suburbs, not traditionally tourist hotspots, are not far behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although statistics are hard to come by in this industry, experts believe the number of guesthouses and B &amp; Bs has doubled in the southern suburbs in recent years, while the Tygerberg area has staked its claim on the tourism map with more than 100 establishments of this kin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further afield, in the popular tourist towns of Hermanus, Montagu and Stellenbosch, there is hardly a street without one or more guesthouses, B &amp; Bs and self-catering units. But the burgeoning industry is not without its problems. Paramount among these is the maintenance of acceptable standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourist accommodation venues can apply for accreditation from Satour by complying with a number of basic requirements. But this does not amount to grading and is voluntary. &quot;Maintaining standards is of serious concern to us,&quot; said Di Campbell, owner of the majestic Table Mountain Lodge in Tamboerskloof and former chairman of the Southern African Guesthouse Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people with very little knowledge of the industry and of service levels required are opening their doors to the outside world. If we are not careful, this small sector will spoil everything for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was confirmed by Liz Westby-Nunn, committee member of the Western Cape Tourism Business Council, who markets guesthouses and owns one in Swellendam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many unskilled people are entering the business without understanding the full significance of the industry and without the necessary professional attitude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What people did not realise was that if you opened a guesthouse you &quot;sell your soul&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You lose your privacy, your time and your friends,&quot; said Ms Westby-Nunn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen to 16-hour days were nothing unusual, Ms Campbell sai Tourism bodies in Tygerberg, Stellenbosch and Hermanus are talking about establishing their own grading systems for informal accommodation by categorising establishments into luxury and budget classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ms Campbell believes this has to take place on a national level to be effective. She believes the booming industry is having a serious impact on middle-market hotels because business travellers are realising guesthouses offer personal service, luxuries and extra touches at cheaper rates than the &quot; no frills&quot; service offered by these hotels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steep hotel prices in the city have also led to an increase in corporate clients in guesthouses and B &amp; Bs in the suburbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Tygerberg is ideal for the corporate tourist because of the huge number of big national companies that have their head offices here,&quot; said Paul Rosenbrock of the Tygerberg Accommodation Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guesthouses and B &amp; Bs in the southern suburbs also cater primarily for business clients. Industry experts cautioned strongly against over-optimistic expectations when offering tourist accommodation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Too many people simply decide to use their retirement packages to open guesthouses without doing the necessary preparation,&quot; said Mr Rosenbrock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Campbell agrees: &quot;Once you feel confident that you have analysed all the pros and cons and that you feel comfortable to be in this industry, the sky is the limit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Strong prospects for agriculture, continuing store renovation and an aggressive expansion into other African countries should boost Pep Stores profits, according to managing director Arnold Louw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting a 15 percent increase in shareholders' profits to R75,7-million in the six months ended December, Mr Louw said good rains over large parts of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe had helped the clothing chain perform &quot; exceptionally well&quot; in these countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five new stores were opened in Zambia, making a total of 13. In Zimbabwe, Pep raised its stake in Power Sales from 25 percent to 40 percent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power Sales contributed R1,7-million to group profits, while the listed Pep Namibia and Pep Botswana added about R13-million to net earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Louw said Pep, which now had 1 185 outlets, had bucked the trend by raising turnover 16 percent to R1,12-billion in the six months, while sales in the clothing sector fell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pep's performance therefore ran counter to the general market trenby This growth resulted from a good year in agriculture, aggressive marketing and consumers returning to cash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The partial write-off of R60-million spent on electronic point-of-sale systems (Epos) slowed growth in operating profit to 11 percent, while growth in investment income was mostly offset by higher finance charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These higher finance charges reflected investment in improved information systems and higher stock levels. Mr Louw said that the benefits of the new systems were not yet reflected in the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's Scottish venture, Your More Store, had performed well over the half-year, he said, contributing almost R9-million to group earnings. The chain now had 115 outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Louw warned that intensified competition from imports was still putting pressure on margins in the manufacturing sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problems experienced by the textile industry at present necessitate the investigation of all rationalisation opportunities in an effort to remain competitive with the rest of the world,&quot; he sai Pep was paying a dividend of 13c a share, covered 2,4 times. Because of the change in year-end, shareholders could expect a similar dividend in the second half-year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Reports of insecurity in Kisangani and Kindu have increased concern among the humanitarian community. There have been conflicting reports concerning looting in Kindu; the Zairean government has denied soldiers are looting in the garrison town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila flew to South Africa today, report news agencies. According to Reuters, a &quot;regional military source&quot; stressed that Kabila would not be meeting representatives of the Zairean government, but confirmed that his visit was &quot;part of consultations with the South Africans on the Zaire conflict&quot;. Kabila's departure comes a day after South African President Mandela announced that he and regional leaders (including Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Congo) would meet Zairean President Mobutu on March 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cape Town, Honore Ngbanda Nzambo, senior security advisor and nephew to President Mobutu, said he met last week with a US delegation led by Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs George Moose, reports AFP. Ngbanda said a South African delegation was present, acting as facilitators. The Zairean representative also said he had met Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni who was in Cape Town last week. Ngbanda praised the &quot;sincerity&quot; of the US team but said the international community &quot;still seems to be playing the hypocrite, and double-talking&quot;, reports AFP. He said that the international community had proof of &quot;involvement&quot; of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi in the fighting but refused to &quot;denounce the agressors&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Tingi-Tingi (I and II) camps - served by air and ground transport from Kisangani only - continue to have an alarmingly high death rate despite improved rations of now 1700 kilocalories. Aid workers point out that health recovery is difficult to achieve on less than a full ration, but also fear that the high mortality rate points to appropriation of food by Rwandan militia and ex-soldiers in the camps. UNHCR has said it is investigating the possibility of evacuating by air the most vulnerable refugees (predominantly children); but any significant change in the security situation in Kisangani directly threatens the existence of the Tingi-Tingi camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan leaders in the two camps at Tingi-Tingi are said to have strong control over refugees and are preventing amalgamation or dispersal of the camps. A journalist recently returned from Tingi-Tingi told IRIN that dormitories and houses on one side of Tingi-Tingi (1) camp were &quot;full of healthy men without dependents&quot;. According to the journalist, Rwandan militia and ex-FAR (Armed Forces of Rwanda) are fighting against the rebels - &quot;FAZ have the guns, but FAR have the motivation&quot;. There are unconfirmed reports of executions of refugees by the Rwandan camp leaders. In Lubutu hospital, of 126 soldiers wounded in combat last week, only 13 were Zairean and the rest were Rwandan, humanitarian sources confirm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Seven people were killed and an infant wounded in an attack on Monday evening, in Bujumbura, Burundi, reports AFP. The attack targetted Paul Nkunzimana, a district secretary of Kamenge, an outlying district of Bujumbura; his wife was killed in the attack. Five suspects, identified as Hutu rebel sympathizers by the authorities, were later arrested. It was the second attack in a week in Kamenge, known as a centre of Hutu unrest in 1994- 95 until the authorities swept the district. District chief Joseph Ndayizeye said that residents have slowly been returning since September and now number 2,500, reports AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In a nine-page report, the Rwandan government has criticised the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. According to the statement, the tribunal has become &quot;discredited in the eyes of the Rwandan people who have been bitterly disappointed by its seeming inability to make serious and sustained efforts in bringing to justice the architects of the genocide&quot;. In a press conference last week, Justice Minister Faustin Nteziryano said the tribunal had failed to go after the ringleaders of the genocide, but had pursued &quot;lesser criminals&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan government criticised the tribunals chief prosecutor Louise Arbour, who divides her time between the international tribunal for Rwanda and the international war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, based in the Hague. The government said she had failed to fulfill the court's main objective &quot;to try persons responsible for genocide to the end that justice may become a tool for promoting reconciliation and peace in Rwanda.&quot; The complaints follow a highly critical internal UN report that said the tribunal was failing in all its administrative functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Sudanese army and militias have killed more than 35 Ethiopian &quot; mercenaries&quot; and Sudanese rebels in Khor Al-Gana area, eastern Sudan, reported a government paper on February 22. The report said Ethiopian forces and rebels of the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army (SPLA) had fled, leaving behind their dead, weapons and food supplies carrying Ethiopian markings.  Sudan has accused Ethiopia and Eritrea of supporting the rebel offensive.  Both countries deny any involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* European Union Foreign Ministers gathering for their monthly meeting in Brussels were greeted by drum-beating protestors yesterday. Protestors were demonstrating for more positive EU action in Africa's Great Lakes region, reports Reuters. The Great Lakes was one of the subjects to be discussed at the monthly meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A heads of state summit was held at Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire on 20 February under the chairmanship of President of Togo, General Gnassingbe Eyadema. A joint communique issued after the summit included recommendations on the Great Lakes crisis, and called for an intervention force. It also requested an extraordinary session of the Central Organ (for Conflict Resolution) of the OAU on the crisis at the heads of state and heads of government level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A two day peace conference will be held in Kampala, Uganda, from tomorrow.  The conference - &quot;The Challenge of Peace in Northern Uganda: A Search for Solutions&quot; - is being coordinated by the Agency for Cooperation and Research in Development (ACORD) and the Ugandan Women's Network (UWONET). Participants will include representatives from local communities, government, UN agencies, NGOs and experts in conflict resolution. For more information contact Sam Aisu at ACORD, PO Box 280, Kampala (Tel: 256-41-267667/8, FAX: 256-41-267669, e-mail: ACORD@MUKLA.gn.apc.org).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Following yesterdays student riots in Nairobi over the death of a student leader, the United States embassy issued a statement today deploring the &quot; violent and so far unexplained death&quot; of leader Solomon Muruli. The statement urged the government to give high priority to investigating the circumstances surrounding Muruli's death, and a full and prompt disclosure of the results.  The British High Commission also released a statement. Nairobi University was closed until further notice yesterday, and hundreds of riot police stood by as students packed up and left the campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Leader of the mercenaries fighting for the Zairean army, Christian Tavernier, said on Sunday in a telephone interview from eastern Zaire that &quot; the balance of strength is currently against us&quot;, reports Reuters. Tavernier accused Uganda of supporting the rebels, claiming &quot;well-organised units come from Uganda, carry out an operation, attack a position, and then retreat&quot;. He said &quot;The Zairean army is in a tangle, like the rest of the country, with almost no logistics&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - African ministers begin a three-day meeting Wednesday against the backdrop of daunting soci-political and economic problems facing their continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underscoring the magnitude of the crises is the fact that the delegates to the Organization of Africa Unity's 65th ministerial council have been forced by a United States-sponsored United Nations air embargo to take a rather circuitous and inconvenient route to attend the meeting in the Libyan capital, Tripoli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a delegate from Sudan, which is also under threat of a similar sanction, &quot;this is part of the prize we have to pay for coming from Africa in a world dominated by Western hegemony.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya has been under the pangs of the U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal to surrender for trial in the U.S. and Britain two of its nationals accused of the December 1988 bombing of PanAm flight 103. So, it is using the O.A.U. meeting to make a political statement on African solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Libyans the O.A.U. meeting is a way of easing Tripoli's isolation, although it remains to be seen how this can be transformed into a major influence at ending the sanctions in the face of Washington's stiff opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political and social strife is another worrisome topic that will engage the African ministers. There is the escalating conflicts in the Great Lakes region where Zaire is accusing Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda of supporting anti- government forces which have captured swathes of the country's east. These countries have denied the Zairean charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, subregional peace initiatives including a meeting of regional leaders in Nov. 1996 in Nairobi, Kenya, have failed to end the crisis, which raised humanitarian and security concerns in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While, Zaire welcomes intervention by the O.A.U., the Uganda delegation to the ongoing ministerial meeting in Tripoli insists the issue should not be internationalised. The Ugandans say &quot;it is an internal issue, which Zaire can be helped to solve by its neighbours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The horn of African is another trouble spot with the conflict in Somalia defying solution. There is also Angola, where the 30-year old civil war has refused to disappear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from refugee problems created by these conflicts, Africa also has to deal with the problems of drought and famine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a more positive note, there is gradual restoration of peace and democracy in Sierra Leone, through the efforts of Cote d'Ivoire to get the Revolutionary United Front to end the war against Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, with the help of the subregional Economic Community of West African States, Liberia is closer now to elections after seven-years of civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the whole, until its next summit in Harare, Zimbabwe, in June the O.A.U.  may be busy with its dogged search for peace and solutions to the continents myriad socio-economic and political problems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official statistics, presented at the ongoing 65th ordinary session of the Council of Ministers in the Libyan capital, showed that 9.6 million U.S.  dollars of the total 18.7 million available to the fund by the end of December 1996 was spent on the organizations Observer Mission In Burundi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund has only three million dollars after an expenditure of 15.6 million dollars on various continental peace efforts. These included 1.5 million dollars devoted to preventive diplomacy in the Comoros, Congo, Gabon, Liberia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Togo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Procurement of military and other equipment for the peace efforts gulped 2.  5 million dollars, while non-military component of the mechanism accounted for 1.7 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contributions and donations from Africa amounted to 6.2 million dollars, while donor countries and international organisations outside Africa contributed 12.4 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O.A.U. Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim, in his report to a meeting of African ambassadors ahead of the Council of Ministers meeting beginning Wednesday, appealed to member states to step up their voluntary contributions to the fund. This was instituted in Cairo, Egypt, at the 29th O.A.U. summit in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim told the envoys that a pledge of 2.8 million dollars was being processed from the European Union and the Belgian government towards the fund.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - The Mozambican government threw its weight Tuesday behind the international campaign against land mines, when the country's president, Joaquim Chissano, called on mine producing nations to end their manufacture and sale immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such measures, he said, were needed in order to halt the indiscriminate killing and maiming of &quot;the thousands of people who are victims of these lethal devices every year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the fourth International Conference on Land mines, Chissano said that an end to the manufacture of land mines, all other efforts, including demining, would be useless.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He compared demining to efforts at filling a sieve with water. instead of perpetually removing mines. He said it would be to &quot;turn off the tap&quot; - namely, shut the factories that produce the devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 1,000 areas in Mozambique have been mined. Between January 1993 and January 1997, 7,400 kilometres of road, 1,700 kilometres of railway, 1,800 kilometres of electricity transmission line and 2,300 quare kilometres of farmland had been demined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1992, sappers have removed about 30,000 mines from Mozambican soil.  Currently, the pace of operations has quickened and perhaps 11,000 mines a year are being removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said that at this rate it would take between 46 and 160 years to ensure that the country was free of mines: the exact length of time depending on how many mines were placed during the wars Mozambique has suffered since 1964. Estimates range up to 1.5 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not just for the country to have to wait so long to be free of land mines,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on the international community to make more resources available to speed up mine clearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chissano attacked the lack of concern shown by countries where land mines are produced. One of the reasons they were not bothered, he said, was that mines rarely killed citizens of these countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These weapons never exterminate their own people. They destroy the peoples of other countries,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major focus of concern was on the producing countries, he said, since once they stopped manufacturing these devices, the problem would cease to exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chissano said he wanted an international treaty banning the production, storage, transport, sale and use of land mines, particularly anti-personnel mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coordinator of the international campaign to ban land mines, Jody Williams, told the Mozambican news agency, AIM, that she regarded the Maputo conference as one more step towards precisely such a treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This conference will not only draw the attention of the world to the problems caused by mines in this region but will also help us define strategies to create a Southern Africa free of land mines&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those sponsoring the conference is former Education Minister Graca Machel, widow of the country's first president, Samora Machel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the agency that for as long as measures to impose a total ban were not taken, the world would continue to watch innocent people suffer death and mutilation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that, although the war in Mozambique ended over four years ago, mines were still killing an average of 40 people a month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwean police will begin investigations immediately into sodomy allegations against the former Zimbabwean president, Rev. Canaan Banana, Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are allegations that have been made and before then (the investigations) I cannot say much more than that,&quot; he told the Zimbabwe Inter- Africa News Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banana's alleged homosexual rape of his former police aide-de-camp was made in a Harare High Court where the victim and former police inspector, Jefta Dube, was convicted of the murder of a former police constable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dube's defence was that he was not responsible for his actions. This he put partly to the trauma he suffered when Banana repeatedly sexually abused Dube in the official presidential residence, between 1983 and 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dube told the court he shot his fellow policeman, Constable Patrick Mashure, at a musical concert at Gwanzura Stadium in Harare after Mashure called Dube &quot;Banana's wife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Bartlett, after finding Dube guilty of murder with actual intent but with diminished responsibility, recommended that the police commissioner and the attorney-general's office investigate the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one is seen to be above the law,&quot; Bartlett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sodomy is a criminal offence in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dube's lawyer, Byron Hove, said while his client was &quot;only too willing&quot; to have Banana prosecuted, Dube would definitely be suing the former president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Robert Mugabe has unwaveringly criticized homosexuals as perverts and sodomites, saying they were &quot;worse than dogs and pigs&quot; and undeserving of rights of any kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Bartlett, who sentenced Dube to 10 years imprisonment, said the allegations against Banana could not be dismissed as not being &quot;reasonably possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two psychiatrists testified that Dube suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Bartlett said he could not rule out that the stress, coupled with drug and alcohol abuse, could have been the result of his three-year homosexual abuse by Banana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A prominent international statesman married with four children, Banana, who is a theology professor at the University of Zimbabwe, retired in 1987 to pave way for Mugabe (then prime minister) following the introduction of the executive presidency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - The Organisation of African Unity (O.A.U.) welcomes the recent resumption of diplomatic ties between Morocco and Ethiopia and sees it as a positive sign that Rabat could rejoin the O.A.U, an official of the Addis Ababa-Based continental body has said. &quot;We see good signs because Ethiopia is not just a country, it is the headquarters of the O.A.U,&quot; Ibrahim Dagash, the organization's spokesman told PANA Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the venue of the 65th session of the O.A.U.'s ministerial council, he said Morocco's seat at the 53-nation body, Africa's foremost political organisation, had remained reserved for Rabat to take up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dagash said Morocco was welcome to return to the organization from which it suspended its membership in 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Morocco resumed diplomatic ties with Ethiopia after an 18-year break over Addis Ababa's recognition of the Polisario Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was O.A.U's admission of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Polisario's political body, that led to Rabat's suspension of its membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morocco is in dispute with Polisario over ownership of the former Spanish territory called the Western Sahara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue is before the United Nations which plans a much-awaited referendum to determine whether or not the people of the territory want independence from or union with Morocco.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - With total unpaid contributions of 56.25 million U.  S. dollars as of the 1996/97 fiscal year, the Addis Ababa-based Organization of African Unity (O.A.U.) is still owed a lot of money, an official has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although members are paying up, the situation is still critical,&quot; said Ibrahim Dagash, head of the Organization's Information Division, ahead of the annual foreign ministers' conference of the continental body.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outstanding amount represent almost twice the organization's annual budget of about 30 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his report to the 65th ministerial council, O.A.U. Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim's said that only 11 of the 53-member countries are up to date in their 1996/97 regular budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are Senegal, which has paid in advance in the 1997/98 budget; Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Eritrea, Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although O.A.U. officials said that this was an improvement over the same period in 1996, when some 60 million dollars were owed the body, they added that here was need for stronger financial commitment by members to enable the organization live up to its responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chad, the Central African Republic and Equatorial Guinea are in arrears of between 10 and 12 years. They risk sanctions, including denial of voting rights and other privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four other countries, the Comoros, Cape Verde, Sao Tome E Principe and Zaire, on the other hand, have been granted varying rescheduling concessions between February 1997 and January 2003.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The new Employment Bill, which will set basic conditions of employment for all employees in South Africa, is to be submitted to Cabinet &quot; in the next couple of weeks&quot;, according to Minister of Labour Tito Mboweni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has already fired the first warning shots in what could be another tough battle for Mr Mboweni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new legislation will revamp the old Basic Conditions of Employment Act and the Wage Act and draw them into a single piece of law aimed principally at protecting the most vulnerable workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the Labour Relations Act, which came into force last November after a long fight between business and trade unions, and which was aimed mostly at improving bargaining rights for unionised workers, the Employment Bill seeks to set minimum standards of employment for those who cannot improve their own conditions through bargaining.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it will set floor conditions for everyone, it is aimed mostly at farmworkers, domestic workers, temporary and part-time employees and anyone else who is not in a position to negotiate better working conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill, which will be published for comment only once it has been approved by Cabinet, is likely to incorporate changes proposed in a Green Paper last year, including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A reduction in the working week from 46 to 45 hours for day workers and from 48 hours for shift workers; * A reduction in the working week for security workers from 60 hours to 48 hours over two years; * Extra pay for night work;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A ban on employment of children of less than 15 years - the official school leaving age;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Better protection for pregnant workers and four months' maternity leave;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Double time for Sunday work; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A compulsory rest day (not necessarily Sunday) for every worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mboweni says he still is aiming for a 40-hour week, but wants this to be achieved through collective bargaining or through setting conditions in specific sectors rather than across the board</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposals do not make specific provision for paid maternity leave, suggesting that women continue to get maternity benefits from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, but that steps be taken to improve the allowances pai Some variation of working conditions is allowed for, &quot;to enable employees and employers to use working time more productively&quot;, says the Department of Labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But basic rights - such as the ban on child labour and protection against employer abuse or unfair dismissals - are not to be tampered with although other conditions may be allowed to vary to fit the demands of work in different sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu, not satisfied with the minister's assurances on the 40-hour week, wants a phased approach and a time frame now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federation, which has been involved in negotiations on this issue in the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) for eight months, also is calling for six months' maternity leave, four of them pai It also is campaigning for a limit of 16 years on the employment of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, in the context of employer pressure for greater flexibility on the labour market, Cosatu also is worried about the variation of standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trade union programme of action, which kicked off yesterday, will include marches, pickets and rallies between now and April when Cosatu's central executive committee meets and assesses progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If sufficient progress has not been made, Cosatu says, a general strike will be called for May 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Mr Mboweni has chosen to act hurt rather than angry in the face of Cosatu's statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was &quot;extremely surprised&quot;, he said last week, at Cosatu's plans to mobilise towards a general strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved, there is a need to handle the negotiations around such a bill with the utmost care,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was talking to Cosatu general secretary Sam Shilowa, that he was committed to a negotiated agreement and that he was sure that &quot;the areas of uncertainty can easily be ironed out to ensure success when the negotiations begin&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once Cabinet has approved the bill, it will be published in the Government Gazette and then tabled for more negotiation at Nedla</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mboweni, who sees this bill as one of the most important new laws to be debated by Parliament in 1997, is determined to get it through this year, in line with promises made by President Mandela in his opening address to Parliament.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Laurent-Desire Kabila, rebel leader of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), held talks in Pretoria, South Africa, with South African, US and UN officials. Joint OAU/UN Special Representative for the Great Lakes region, Mohamed Sahnoun, arrived in South Africa on Tuesday. The South African news agency SAPA reported that Sahnoun; US secretary of State for African Affairs George Moose; and South African deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad were present at the first round of &quot;close proximity&quot; talks. The South African government continues to stress that the talks would take time. One diplomat present at the talks said that the presence of UN/OAU and US officials aimed at reconciling all the international and regional initiatives for eastern Zaire (see IRIN Update 105) .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean government representative, Honore Nzambo Ngbanda - senior security advisor and nephew to President Mobutu Sese Seko - is reported to have left South Africa. He participated in last weeks exploratory talks in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rebel spokesman Raphael Ghenda told AFP today in Goma that Kindu garrison town &quot;is about to fall&quot;. He said that looting by soldiers and flight of the population &quot;has become a classic scenario - our forces are on the point of capturing the town&quot;. Kindu has a major airport, is a railhead for the mineral- rich Shaba province, and was a major military base for the government counter- offensive. The Zairean government denies there has been looting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* World Food Programme sent in its first airlift of emergency food supplies to Punia yesterday - an outpost about 170 kilometers south of Tingi-Tingi camps, eastern Zaire - where 4,000 Rwandans have arrived in poor nutritional condition. An estimated 160 refugees are arriving daily. A WFP/UNHCR mission visited Punia on Sunday. WFP said it completed its largest food distribution to date in Tingi-Tingi on Monday, where some 170,000 Rwandans received a seven-day food package containing maize, beans, corn-soya blend and vegetable oil. WFP said it now had &quot;ample stocks&quot; in Tingi-Tingi camps but was concerned about the impact of insecurity and the onset of the rainy season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian sources from Tingi-Tingi camps confirmed today that a commercial air operation has been flying Rwandans out of Tingi-Tingi camp to Kisangani, and on to Nairobi. The flight costs around $800. Well-placed sources say a few hundred Rwandans, including ex-FAR, have left Tingi-Tingi by air recently. Sources say the exodus of ex-FAR could facilitate repatriation attempts of refugees to Rwanda, and assist the on-going negotiations for the opening of safe corridors. Unconfirmed reports say ex- FAR have requested that lower-ranking former-FAR from Tingi-Tingi be re- integrated into the Rwandan army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Punia, an AFP reporter says refugees arriving fearful of the rapid rebel advance. The reporter, who interviewed refugees in Punia, says most of then hid in thick forest and scrub for weeks and are fearful of being caught in fighting. Refugees are arriving from the north and south, and feel trapped; AFP say the refugees are hoping the international community will open a new camp to provide them with a safe haven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Speculation continues about the security situation in Kindu and Kisangani.  The Governor of Maniema, based in Kindu, left the garrison town yesterday for Kisangani, and went on to Kinshasa by a private airline last night. In an interview with AP, a group of senior Zairean officers said dissension and chaos within the army leadership, as well as low morale, years of low wages and dismal living conditions, had driven them to defect to the rebel ADFL.  Nine senior officers have fled to Brazzaville, Congo, and say they are in &quot; transit&quot; to join the front in eastern Zaire. Speaking to AP, a former colonel who gave his name only as &quot;Anti&quot; said the other officers included three other colonels, two majors and two captains, as well as one other officer. Anti claimed hundreds of other officers and rank-and-file soldiers had already switched sides and were in eastern Zaire to aid the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An article in Le Monde today said a Western eyewitness, who has lived in the region for four years, claims that rebels in eastern Zaire have massacred civilians in the Goma region. The eye witness says he saw mass graves and gave nine examples, with their location. Two of the examples he gave were mass graves outside Katale camp, one containing more than a hundred people killed by machine gun, and the other containing 300 people wrapped in plastic sheeting. To-date, there have been no independent human rights monitors in eastern Zaire to investigate various claims relating to killings by the fleeing Zairean army and the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A statement today from the Belgian government emphasised it was concerned about human rights violations committed by all parties in Zaire, and was trying to verify any information regarding genocide in the region. The statement, by a spokesman from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, follows a published interview with Belgian Development Minister Reginald Moreels, who said rebels were committing genocide in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A meeting of the Organisation of African Unity in Tripoli, Libiya, is preoccupied with the crisis in Zaire, reports AFP. OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim in a report prepared for the meeting stressed the need for a ceasefire as soon as possible. Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana called for an &quot;African solution&quot; to the conflict. In his report Salim Salim underlined the urgency for an international conference on peace, security and stability in the Great Lakes region. Other items on the agenda include Burundi and Somalia. Burundi's representative at the OAU, Luc Rukingama, is trying to get regional sanctions lifted, report AFP. 53 Foreign Ministers are meeting in Tripoli at the OAU conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya said yesterday he was &quot;hopeful&quot; of an imminent solution to the conflict in Africa's Great Lakes region, and said he had made &quot;concerted efforts in finding a solution&quot;. Moi complained African leaders had recieved little international support in imposing sanctions on Burundi's military regime. Moi said Kenya had been thrown into turmoil because of regional conflicts, resulting in &quot;influx of refugees, illegal possession of firearms and the disruption of economic activities&quot;. The Kenyan president made the remarks in Gaborone at a banquet held at a Commonwealth conference on democracy. About three thousand Kenyan students and other protestors marched through Nairobi in a another day of demonstrations over the death of a student leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* President Mobutu Sese Seko has postponed his return to Zaire from his villa on the French Riviera, aides said on Tuesday. Mobutu arrived in France on Friday and underwent medical tests at the weekend. He had planned to leave for Zaire on Tuesday, but aides said he would leave on Wednesday at the earliest, report AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A five-day conference on the River Nile basin opened yesterday in Addis Ababa. At least 250 government representatives and researchers are attending from Burundi, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire. The ten states are expected to spell out their positions on the use of the Nile resources. Also taking part are representatives of international organisations such as the World Bank, UNDP, the European Union and donor countries. Opening the conference, the Ethiopian Minister for Water Resources said Ethiopia contributed 86% of the Nile's waters and had the right to equitable share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Hutu rebel leaders in Burundi have announced they had set up their own &quot; courts&quot; to try those they deem responsible for political and other killings in Burundi, reports AFP. Rebel leader Leonard Nyangoma said several trials in Burundi had convicted Hutus of genocide against Tutsis in the massacres that took place after the 1993 coup; the rebel &quot;courts&quot; would now try Tutsis suspected in involvement in the military coup, said a statement released to the press. Leonard Nyangoma - head of the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD) - said roving tribunals had been set up in all the country's provinces. He also denounced the United Nations, charging that it was indifferent to the unrest in Burundi and was failing to set up an international criminal tribunal similar to the one set up for Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Deposed Burundi president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya is reportedly ready to leave the US ambassador's residence in Bujumbura after talks with his successor, Major Pierre Buyoya. In a statement yesterday, the opposition Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) said Ntibantunganya was ready to leave after hiding since July 1996 in the US residence. The announcement has not been confirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome - The onset of the rainy season in eastern Zaire will create further obstacles in reaching some 170,000 Rwandans in refugee camps, said the United Nations World Food Programme today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP sends significant quantities of food by air to refugee camps such as Tingi Tingi, but growing problems of heavy cloud cover will limit the number of flights WFP can make each day. Land routes from Kisangani to the camps are also expected to become even more problematic as bad patches in the road become impassable due to rain which has already started in some areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent reports of insecurity in eastern Zaire are also having an impact on humanitarian operations. Reports of insecurity in the region may negatively affect WFP deliveries of food from Lusaka to Kisangani which is a 2,000 km journey using road, rail, and barge. Over the weekend, WFP sent 200 tons of food from Kindu to Kisangani by barge, and a further 300 tons is on wagons south of Kindu. WFP presently has an additional 1,000 tons of food in Lubumbashi in transit to Kisangani. These supplies represent at least 20 days' worth of food for the 170,000 refugees in Eastern Zaire, the highest in- country stockpile of food since December 1996 when the crisis began.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is ironic that in a moment when we have overcome many complex problems affecting food deliveries, other uncontrollable constraints like poor weather and insecurity are threatening to curb our operation,&quot; said WFP spokesman Trevor Rowe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday WFP completed the largest food distribution to-date in Tingi Tingi camp where some 170,000 Rwandan refugees received a seven-day food package containing maize, beans, corn-soya blend and vegetable oil. In order to undertake such a large distribution, WFP had to haul most of the food 240 kms overland. This involved contracting 55 trucks and 39 pick-up vehicles - virtually every commercial truck and pick-up available for miles in the Kisangani area. The now-ample WFP food stocks in Tingi Tingi camp will be bolstered by more convoys set to leave Kisangani tomorrow with 210 tons of food, which is a three-day supply for the camp population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As refugees continue to flee locations in Eastern Zaire, their health progressively deteriorates and relief agencies such as WFP are forced to shift their operations in order to respond. Last weekend, some 25,000 refugees from Kalima camp fled on the heels of a rebel advancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP today sent in its first airlift of emergency food supplies (six tons) to Punia, an outpost town some 170 kms south of Tingi Tingi where 4,000 Rwandan refugees have arrived in poor nutritional condition, and an estimated 160 refugees are arriving daily. The decision to send food follows a WFP/UNHCR mission to Punia on Sunday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP flies in an average of 15-20 tons of food daily from Kisangani to Tingi Tingi on DC-3 turbine planes. The planes make three to four trips each day, landing on Tingi Tingi's main road, which also serves as an airstrip. Over the weekend, WFP tested the makeshift runway's ability to handle larger cargo planes by dispatching an Andover aircraft which can carry 50 percent more cargo than the DC-3 aircraft. After a successful landing on Sunday, WFP immediately began using the plane to airlift food supplies to the camps, sending to Tingi Tingi three flights on Monday with a total of 18 tons of relief food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter how much we try, relief operations to Eastern Zaire continue to be hampered by tremendous logistical constraints,&quot; said Rowe. &quot;Impassable roads, small airstrips, scarce fuel supplies and insecurity are still major hurtles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Problems in the initial phase of the WFP operation to Eastern Zaire were also compounded by limited availability of Government approved aircraft to fly in food supplies and reduced numbers of WFP staff to assist in the operation due to Government delays in issuing authorized travel clearances to aid workers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The establishment of the association is a step forward in ensuring the public right to information and of the journalist to gather the same, he said, adding the profession could deserve public respect only when members discharge responsibilities entrusted to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journalists, in a bid to foster development endeavours in the country, should enlighten the public on socio-economic activities, policies and regulations issued to facilitate the implementation of the development strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regional association, he said, has registered achievements in safeguarding the rights and benefits of members over the past six months.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - The Parliamentary Economic Affairs Standing committee organized a public-hearing session here yesterday during which concerned and interested bodies commented on the newly drafted proclamation concerning commercial Registration and Business Licensing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On hand to elaborate on the bill was Trade and Industry Minister Kassahun Ayele, who said that making the commercial code consistent with the free market economic policy and removing needless hurdles which the business community face were the major objectives of the proclamation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him the relevant law still in force was the commercial code of 1960 and most of the regulations, particularly those adopted the Derg regime, remain attuned to the command economy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Kassahun described the bill as a viable instrument for creating a conducive business environment for the law abiding business community and for curbing illegal ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the draft proclamation, business licences for all sectors except seven will be issued only by the pertinent institutions of the trade and industry sector, unlike in the past when a number of government offices were involved. Licences for the seven sectors will be issued by various offices owing to the specific nature of the activities which require special technical knowledges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft proclamation provides: &quot;Any person shall principally register only once eventhough he carries on different commercial activities in different regions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ato Kassahun, registration fees which used to exceed a million birr, depending on the size of the capital invested, were limited to no more than 200 birr under the new proclamation. As to Efficiency, he said that an applicant bearing all the required documents must get his licence within five working days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft proclamation was approved by the Council of Ministers and referred to the House of Peoples' Representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At yesterday's session, participants representing federal and regional investment bureaux, the Chamber of commerce as well as the business community at large, raised various question on which Ato Kassahun, together with three other colleagues elaborated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The Kalub Gas Share Company has announced that the construction of a plant that would produce 65,000 tonnes of petroleum products in Somali Regional State will begin soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon completion after two years, the plant, whose construction is to commence within three months with the sinking of 3,700 - meters deep wells at a site 25 kilometre west of Shilabo town of Ogaden zone, will produce LPG, gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuels, according to company General Manager Jehad Abakoyas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a survey carried out by a foreign company 23 years ago, the areas has a deposit of 74 billion cubic metre natural gas, Ato Jehad noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount of petroleum explored at Kalub is comparable to the amount in high deposit countries including the United States of America, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kalub Gas development project, to be undertaken with a 74 million dollar World Bank loan and an additional budget by the share company, will create job opportunities to 300 residents of the area, he indicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the sale of the liquid petroleum products begins, it is expected to curb depletion of forests for fuelwood, Ato Jehad pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From the sale of the petroleum products the country will annually obtain 17 to 29 million birr in revenue, he said, adding the project has also a prospect to supply electricity to towns around the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing a basic study conducted by the Ministry of Mines and Energy, he indicated the prevalence of similar deposits in Gembela, the Rift Valley, and some areas in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kalub Gas Share Company was established in 1986 E.C. by the government - shareholder of the greater stake - four governmental organizations, five national regional states and over 400 private investors with a capital of 102 million birr.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - Ethiopia has the right to an equitable share of the Nile and to utilize its water resources, the Minister of Water Resources noted here yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the 5th Nile 2,002 Conference, to be held until February 28 at the new conference centre of UNESCA, Ato Sheferaw Jarso stressed that Ethiopia, in the exercise of its sovereignty to the utilisation of its water, reserves its right to make use of them without causing &quot;any appreciable or significant harm to other riparian states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister pointed out that despite huge potential for cooperative development in the Nile Basin, the record shows dismal performance with little or no effort among the concerned countries, &quot;In this regard, the Nile Basin must be one of the few international water courses which lacks any measure of cooperation or any form of comprehensive agreement applicable to all riparian states,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Shiferaw said that it was quite appropriate that the conference was held here in Ethiopia which is the source of the Blue Nile as well as the major contributor to the Nile waters. Noting that the Nile traverses ten African countries covering one tenth of the continent, he expressed hope that the conference will provide a unique opportunity for these states to create &quot; a comprehensive framework&quot; for cooperation. &quot;In the course of deliberations, what should also not be forgotten is the unique and diverse features of the Basin which, on the one hand, exhibits exotic panoramic beauty and, on the other hand with some exception, the remotest, most inaccessible and least developed part of the world,&quot; the Minister stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Shiferaw went on to note that Ethiopia is prepared to engaged in fruitful discussions with other riparian states in the determination of equitable shares of water based on universally accepted principles of international law. &quot;It is thus high time that countries of the Nile Basin set up the institutional framework and engage in serious discussions to derive optimal benefit from their shared water resources and enhance the sustainable development and conservation the eco-system in the Basin,&quot; the Minister noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Mezemir Medmim, Chairman of the National Organizing Committee, said earlier in a welcoming address that the reasons why Ethiopia is hosting the conference is that many nations owe a great deal to the Nile as &quot;it is but 86% Ethiopia.&quot; According to Ato Mezemir, another reason can best be explained by the Ethiopian saying which he puts as, &quot;The daughter of Abbay (Blue Nile) is thirsty,&quot; both in literal metaphoric senses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While Abbay or the Blue Nile contributes the major portion of the entire flow, there are times when many people of the world wondered whether there was a drop of water in Ethiopia at all,&quot; he said, adding that why the &quot; daughter of Abbay&quot; should be thirsty is a subject matter of the conference not only for Ethipians but for the international community as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Mezemir pointed out that 17 international, governmental and private organizations including FAO, UNDP, Danish International Development Agency, USAID and Canadian International Development Agency had provided financial support. The last covered over a quarter of the budgetary requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Canadian ambassador, Mr. Gabriel M. Lessard, said his country's involvement in the Nile stems from the issues at stake: the economic social and eco-system of more than 250 million people of the Basin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The years of drought and last year's flood here in Ethiopia are just few examples which vividly illustrate the point,&quot; he pointed out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - The teaser on Monday, January 27, promised fire works. The story, the following day, left a lot of readers wondering what the fuss had been all about. Some even felt cheated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After its successful series on child abuse, a lot of readers believed the Reserve Bank story would be equally revealing. But it ended, not just a disappointment, but it left the impression that there was much more to the story than met the eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Reserve Bank is a public institution, right? It is indeed. But to whom is it answerable? Certainly not to the public like all other institutions,&quot; read the teaser. It went on to list questions that had been asked by The Herald: &quot;Was it true that the Reserve Bank was spending money as soon as they printed it? Was it true that half of the new Reserve Bank building was empty?  Was it true that they built themselves expensive chalets at Juliasdale ...  was it true that they built themselves a high-tech shooting range under the Reserve Bank building?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were all questions that wetted any reader's appetite. Herald news editor Funny Mushava and business editor Cephas Chitsaka had pieced the story together despite the reluctance by the bank to talk to the paper. But come Tuesday when the story appeared. First it was not by Funny Mushava and Cephas Chitsaka unless there was a mistake somewhere since it was only by-lined Funny Mushava. Indeed, all the questions in the teaser were raised but somehow some explanation was given. After reading the story one was left with a feeling that perhaps this was the first instalment of a series which would be carried on the following day. But that was the end of it. Next, was a story quoting Finance Minster Herbert Murerwa that he was happy with the way the Reserve Bank is being run. Murerwa had provided the paper with a good news peg to pursue their story if they really believed the Reserve Bank was wasting taxpayer's money, but that was the end of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This led to a lot of speculation about what the purpose of doing the story was. Some observers, thought perhaps someone at Herald House had an axe to grind with someone at the Reserve Bank. Others felt maybe someone just wanted to tell us that the Governor of the Reserve Bank had spent millions of dollars on renovations at his official residence which he had not been using since 1993. Yet another theory was that perhaps it was to bring to our attention that IMF officials come here on holiday and not on business as they spent their time at the chalets in Juliasdale. Another &quot;wild&quot; suggestion was that it was perhaps one chef trying to outdo the other. In short, people were so short-changed they tried to build a better story of their own.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - The much-talked about World Bank $700 million facility, (which should now be around $760 million since it is actually US$70 million), the biggest facility for the indigenous business sector continues to be elusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven months have now gone since local World Bank officials said it would be disbursed. If Indigenous Business Development Centre (IBDC) president Ben Mucheche was right last year that five years had gone by since negotiations on the facility started then negotiations are now in their sixth year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facility which was scheduled to be put on line in July, and received the green-light form the World Bank vice- President for Africa Callisto Madawo, a Zimbabwean, towards the end of last year and was even toasted by Finance Minster Herbert Murerwa when he visited Washington, has still not been disbursed vindicating The Insider which predicted that the facility would not be disbursed until this year. Although Parliament has now approved the loan, it is still not clear when it will be disbursed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources, the major hold-up has been disagreement between the World Bank and the government about the interest rate that should be charged.  The bank insists that market rates should apply. The government is looking for a cheaper facility similar to the one it has provided under the Credit Guarantee Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even commercial banks that will administer the facility argue that the problem in Zimbabwe is not lack of cash but high interest rates that are crippling the business sector. What business requires, they argue, is cheap money so if the World Bank money is not going to be cheaper than that already available on the open market, the facility is likely to be of little benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the two are still haggling about the technicalities, things seem to be moving in favour of the World Bank. Interest rates are starting to decline and they are likely to drop further following the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe's reduction of its rediscount rate by 3.5 percent. Insiders, however, say there could be another hitch-who will disburse the money?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is no question that the bulk of the money will be disbursed by commercial banks, the question now is which ones. Watchers say the country's largest commercial bank, Standard Chartered, may be out unless it abruptly changes its current thrust. Sources say the bank no longer handles loans of under $250 000, which is probably what most small to medium enterprises require. Although chief executive, Barry Hamilton said his bank was trying to devise a means of effectively lending to small businesses because this is a very important sector, he also stated that the bank had lost substantial amounts of money to small businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not come out of it but we have been hurt by it,&quot; he was quoted as saying. Public-owned Zimbank in which the state is a major shareholder could also be out as it is trying to get up on its feet after being rescued by the Reserve Bank because of bad debts. This will leave only Stanbic, Barclays and the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe which currently seems to be a darling with small businesses. But because of the publicity the fund has been given, almost every prospective business person is looking forward to a slice of the funds. Even the little known Indigenous Youth Empowerment Group is demanding its fair share of $10 million from the facility.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Public Construction and National Housing Minister Enos Chikowore has seen the light at last. Unfortunately, this comes at the very time his ministry seems to have lost steam in its housing programme which was hailed - - once again unfortunately - - just prior to the 1995 general elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has finally admitted that the goal of housing for all by the year 2000 is unrealistic. And the year 2000 is only 35 months away. Chikowore said that the present housing waiting list is 670 000 and under the current rate of housing provision the backlog could increase to over one million by 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the same breath he set 2010 as the target to provide housing for all.  One can only hope he was misquoted because this does not make sense. All the same he must be commended for realising that 2 000 is not too far off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN fact, the way things are going, most people are expecting to be worse off by the year 2000. In Harare, for example, where the waiting list has been stagnant at 100 000 is likely to be worse as houses are increasingly getting out of reach of most people. While statistics seem to tell a different story, the reality is that nothing much is changing. One can only hope that other government departments and agencies can take cue from Chikowore because we still hear of health for all by the year 2000, or about 600 000 AIDS orphans by the year 2000. This figure has been touted about for the past three years yet the number of people dying of AIDS is reportedly increasing and is now reported to be 500 a week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - The Com Shop advert about Nokia cellphones may just be doing what the doctor ordered. It has stirred the controversy that attracts attention to a product - - though this may be in bad taste to some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether this is translated to sales or a boycott is something else but, it has created the attention. Debate on the advert &quot;the one with the sulky model and the Nokias&quot; was kicked off by Barbara Reed, who runs a market research firm. In her letter to the local media, Reed posed several questions about who the advert was targeted at.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was it aimed at those who believe they need &quot;two Nokias and no brains,&quot; Males whose careers picked in the late 60s . .... Males whose organs are bigger than their brains ... Males with an infantile humour ... Females who think it's clever to be associated with the males described above ...  Businessmen whose brains are below the belt?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reed was supported by Bev Clark who appears to own a Nokia. &quot;If I had known how sexist their advertising was going to be, I certainly would not have bought a cellphone from them. It should be noted that advertising such as this isn't harmless and just irritating. By continuing to objectify women, whether it is subtle or just plain Nokia stupid perpetuates gender inequality.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Praxedes Dzangare for DDH &amp; M Advertising , the advertising agency which placed the advert asked: &quot;Could that just have been a plug for a research company or was Barbara Reed really offended by the Com Shop advertisement for Nokia?... I'd like to say that we have far more women here than men- - eleven to five at last count. I am the MD, the media chief is a woman, two account directors are women ... We did give the advertisement a lot of thought when we first saw it, then ran it past all the girls here. Without exception, they found it more amusing than offensive .... There have been a number of calls from distressed women, all of very similar views, which I suppose one could describe as 'actively feminist'. Of course, we regret any offence to them and will try to steer a slightly different course next time.  However, there have been at least as many calls from men and women who accepted the subject as a light- hearted flag-raising performance, which is how we ourselves viewed it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate is likely to go on.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Bulawayo towelling firm, Merlin is back. &quot;The greatest thing in this world is not so much where we are, but in what direction we are moving,&quot; the company says in adverts currently running in the local press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks to our stakeholders and especially a dedicated staff and the loyalty of our customers, Merlin is forging ahead, supplying a thriving local market, focusing on all round excellence. Yes, Merlin is here to stay and going forward committed to building and maintaining quality in the Zimbabwean textile industry.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company was rescued by its sister company Merspin which pledged to invest $40 million relieving the company of a substantial amount of its interest-bearing debt and saving 1 200 jobs. This is good news indeed but it also puts into question: how did the other textile company, Cone, collapse completely after all the efforts and money the government and financial institutions put in and the sacrifices workers made?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the case of Cone now closed for good, when stories continue to be told about how its former principal owner is living in luxury and is reported to be expanding his other businesses, both locally and in neighbouring countries? Perhaps, as some government critics recently advocated, the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) should take up the matter as this is a case of greater national importance than harassing little nobodies. After all, the lives of nearly 50 000 people were put - - and are still - - at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or is it that the much-feared organisation cannot do anything because investigations could open up a can of worms? There have always been whispers that some chefs were involved in the wheeling and dealing of the previous owners? These whispers say the former owners were so well connected that this is why they managed to off-load all the company's debts to the government and financial institutions. The previous owners came out clean when they closed the factory while the government and financial institutions were saddled with heavy debts and workers were left empty-handed and given false hopes that the company could salvaged by someone else.f</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Two important conferences aimed at boosting investment in the country as well as exports are lined up for March, one in London and the other in Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The London conference which will be attended by top government officials including President Robert Mugabe is being organised by the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries together with their British counterparts and will be held from March 15. It is a follow up to another conference that was held three years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mozambican mission is being organised by the trade promotion agency Zimtrade whose director, Morrison Sifelani has just resigned. Zimtrade says Mozambique provides limitless opportunities for Zimbabwe. Potential exports to that country include general foodstuffs such as groceries, biscuits, tea, coffee, jam, marmalades, cordials, dairy products, mealie meal, flour, edible fats and oils; engineering products and services which can include fire extinguishers, motor vehicles and motor vehicle spares; catering equipment, cosmetics; plumbing fittings and equipment; stationery, domestic appliances, utensils and enamelware; agricultural inputs and implements; railway components, grain bags, nets and ropes; tyres and tubes; bathroom accessories; plasticware; brushes; asbestos and assorted construction components, packaging materials; and paint and paint accessories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe badly needs to boost its exports. According to the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office the country had a trade deficit of $2.2 billion in the first half of last year. It imported goods worth $12.6 billion and earned only $10.4 billion. The main imports were machinery and transport equipment which accounted for 40.4 percent of the amount spent on imports, manufactured goods which took 16.6 percent and chemicals which accounted for 12.9 percent. The main exports remained unmanufactured tobacco accounting for 22.5 percent of total export revenue followed by ferro alloys with 9.4 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa continued to dominate Zimbabwe's imports accounting for 38.1 percent followed by the United Kingdom with 9.4 percent and the United States with 5.7 percent. Japan, Germany and France followed. Most of Zimbabwe s exports went to the United Kingdom which took 13.2 percent, followed by South Africa with 11.3 percent and Germany with 7.2 percent. Major exports also went to Japan., Mozambique and Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his message to mark the end of 1996, Sifelani said 1997 should see an increase in the volume of exports both regionally and internationally as 1996 had been a year of consolidating existing markets. He pointed out, however, that for this to happen, the business environment in Zimbabwe had to improve.  Manufacturers should introduce new products, adapt existing ones and improve packaging if they were to withstand competition in the international arena.  He said local businessmen should be more aggressive because they and stop being too risk averse . While trade with Botswana had recorded little change that in Namibia had increased by up to 400 percent since the signing of a trade agreement with that country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Computer giant, IBM must be feeling the heat. After being accused of frustrating Zimbabweans within the local subsidiary, Bedford Investments, the company has resorted to placing full page adverts in the local media stating its commitment that it &quot;fully accepts the requirements of the ZIC (Zimbabwe Investment Centre) that 30 percent of the equity should be held by local investors&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But accepting and implementing are two different things. Since its re-entry into Zimbabwe 14 months ago, the company says, IBM has more than doubled its business. It also says the majority of the company's employees and management are Zimbabwean. But the fact remains, some of the Zimbabweans are not happy.  Denny Marandure, for example, has just resigned for allegedly being &quot;parked&quot; in South Africa. By the look of it, something must be terribly amiss within Bedford Investments. The adverts the company is placing are not cheap and Bedford Investments is going to great lengths to paint a picture that everything is above board. A full page in The Herald costs between $26 000 and $31 000, and that's a lot of money to spend on 140 words.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE government, always short of revenue, could have lost $8 million, allegedly through errors by shipping agents in the last quarter of 1996 had customs officials simply accepted and just ticked as correct all entries made by shipping agents. The Collector of Customs and Excise at Beitbridge Johnson Moyo is reported as saying out of an average 200 billls of entry submitted to customs, 30 percent fell under wrong tariffs. In January alone the department discovered some2 730 errors which would have cost the state $2.4 million if they had been let through. Shipping agents are now being charged $300 per error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALTHOUGH not producing enough to meet local demand, Zimbabwe is now stuck with more than 100 000 tonnes of wheat because of cheaper imports from Argentina. The Grain Marketing Board which recently reported that it had drastically reduced its debt is said to be saddled with 60 000 tonnes while private growers have 45 000 tonnes. GMB chairman Kumbirai Katsande who is also the managing director of Nestle, which itself is supposed to use a lot of wheat in its baby foods and other cereals, says local millers prefer Argentinean wheat which sells for US$250 a tonne, and is supposedly cheaper than local wheat which goes for $2 580 according to the latest Zimace prices.  But the price difference is very insignificant unless the Argentinean wheat is well below US$250. Katsande said local wheat was of even better quality which poses even more questions as to why local millers prefer it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With this year's good rains and most dams almost full, wheat farmers were going to have a bumper harvest but most are reported to be switching to barley which is grown under contract with National Breweries. But Natbrew requirements for barley are reported to be only between 55 000 and 60 000 tonnes. The government allowed local farmers to export wheat last year. But it looks it is not only wheat producers who are facing problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabweans have an appetite for imported foods according to Katsande and food manufacturers are finding it cheaper to import finished food products than manufacturing them because of the distorted tariff regime. He said the present tariffs favour the import of finished products as opposed to raw materials. Even retailers, he said, found it more lucrative to have direct supply arrangments with South African retailers who in turn supported their country's food manufacturing industry. &quot;This linkage does not exist in Zimbabwe,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SMALL-scale millers who have been credited with bringing down the price of mealie meal are now beginning to fell the pinch and they have increased their prices by between 10 and 12 percent. They say they can no longer contain the costs following the increase in the price of maize by the Grain Marketing Board, but most of the millers source their own maize and only resort to the GMB when they cannot find maize on the market. The GMB increased its maize selling price from $1 500 to $1 675 a tonne which is roughly the selling price on the open market. According to ZIMACE there are offers of up to $1 750 a tonne in April with the price likely to drop down to $1 500 the following month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMBABWE Alloys is suspending operations for the whole of March because of low metal prices on the world market. The company is facing stiff competition from lower priced products from China and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). But according to the Central Statisics Office, ferro alloys were the second major export from Zimbabwe in the first half of last year.  Tobacco took top honours.Sales of ferro alloys brought in $840.7 million in the first six months of 1996 compared to $823 million in the first half of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE of the country's major tea producers. Tanganda is expecting to produce more than 8 000 tonnes of tea for the year ending October. Coffee production is also expected to surpass 600 tonnes. In the last financial year ending October it produced 8 909 tonnes of tea in 14 months. Coffee production was very disappointing resulting in an overall loss of $3.2 million compared to a profit of $9.8 million the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE-based drink manufacturer Tru-Cool could go into liquidation because of competition from back-yard manufacturers in the high density suburbs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - The Zimbabwe Stock exchange has turned into a market of stark contrasts. While the industrial index has been reaching new highs almost every month rising from just under 4 000 points at the beginning of 1996 to over 10 000 points a year later, the mining index has hit a 12-month low coming down to some 965 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is despite news that there is growing interest in the mining industry, particularly in diamonds, although up to now only one mine is operating in the country. An analysis of share prices of the seven listed mining companies shows that all except Wankie have been badly hit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashanti which at one time traded for $200 is down to $100 but it has not hit its lowest price of $80 in the past 12 months. Bindura is around $8 down from a peak of $14.75. Gold miners Falcon and Falgold are worse. Falcon has dropped from $29 to $12.50 and Falgold from $3.10 to 90 cents. Wankie has only lost marginally from its peak of $6.20 to $5 but is way above its 12 monthlow of $1.70.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In industrials, although prices have started falling of late, the story is completely different with companies like ZSR which once traded (in the past 12 months) for $2.25 now trading at $15 and Zimpapers which at one time was down at $1.70 peaking at $30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Truworths, in the troubled clothing industry and with its chief executive allegedly in some scam is up from $1.45 to $11, and sugar company, Hippo from $1.70 to $14.50.With most analysts predicting that there is likely to be no significant rise in the industrial index in the first half of the year as the market seeks to consolidate itself, focus seems to have turned to the mergers which have just been approved by the Reserve Bank. PGI has been given the green light to acquire troubled Johnson and Fletcher which was owned by the Meikles. J&amp; F which at one time traded at $1.10 had gone up to $4.20 peaking at $4.80 while PGI itself has only marginally risen from $4.40 to $6.50 in the past 12 months. PGI is offering three PG I shares and $4 for every five J &amp; F shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one market analyst the high cash content of the offer should be of concern because PGI was suffering from a high interest bill in the interim stage. The analyst said PGI would have to improve its cash generation significantly in the second half to ensure that the interest bill does not effectively eliminate operating profits. But there could be rewards to be reaped. Through the acquisition PGI has effectively gained a stranglehold on the manufacture and supply of timber and glass to the construction sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other merger is between Hunyani and FP Holdings, another Meikles company. Hunyani is offering FP shareholders one Hunyani share and 76 cents for every 10 FP shares they hold. At the beginning of this month Hunyani was trading at $3.45 while FP was trading at 39 cents. It highest price in the past 12 months was only 40 cents and the lowest 18 cents. Hunyani's highest price was $4 and the lowest $2.45. The market analysts said FP was likely to contribute $11 million to Hunyani s operating profits during the year as there were likely to be huge cost savings through the streamlining of the head office as well as the slight reduction of workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the use of Hunyani's purchasing power should allow them to improve the purchase costs associated with their raw material supplies, the analyst said. The outlook for Hunyani is encouraging. Production of tobacco should be strong this year, and the company s sacks and cartons division should perform well given the phenomenal demand presently being experienced for fast food. The analyst also noted that Hunyani s intentions to move into the open crate boxes for distribution to horticultural concerns should prove profitable in the medium term, but he warned that operating margins have declined for four consecutive years and this trend is likely to continue. He said that while operating costs for Hunyani increased by only 12 percent last year, this was not in line with the cost increases associated with labour and raw materials. But the good news was that with the contribution from Print Holdings attributable profits were likely to be around $70 million to $75 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the greatest attention seems to be focused on Trans-Zambezi Industries, a company that has acquired loss-making public companies and is trying to turn them around. TZI has just announced that it wants to acquire the entire share capital of Chloride and Art and would like to be listed on the ZSE. Art has been trading at around 10 cents from 65 cents and Chloride at $1.30 up from a 12-month low of 28 cents. TZI is offering one share for every 444 Art shares or nine cents for every Art share, one share for every 100 Art preference shares or 40 cents and one share for every 30 Art A shares or $1.  33 in cash. The same offer has been extended to Chloride where it is offering one share for every 30 Chloride shares or $1.33 cash. TZI shares will be in the form of depository receipts, the aim being that local receipt holders will not be prejudiced by double taxation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - STARTED last month this is the final part of the Idigenous Business Development Centre (IBDC) document on indigenisation which was presented to the ZANUPF national conference in Bulawayo in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government through the Reserve Bank should direct that a minimum of 60 percent of investible funds be made available to the indigenous sector. This has been done in India and Malaysia and it has succeeded. These are the institutions which have failed the nation in providing funds for creating employment due to institutional racism and a colonial banking culture. As a matter of priority, government should review legislation governing the operations of financial institutions with the view to making them socially and politically receptive to the indigenisation policy and further take a long term view of the economic development of Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banking Affairs Board should be put in place as soon as possible and the Banking Act must be amended. Government should admit new banks into the system under the mandate that 60 percent of the shareholding should be indigenous. Financial institutions, though state-owned or foreign-owned are in the main biased against indigenous business. Thus, even in those institutions which are government controlled, the indigenous entrepreneur faces similar problems to those in foreign, white owned institutions. The situation calls for decisive, corrective action by government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family houses should not be taken by banks as security for loans in order to protect families who are on a daily basis being thrown out of their houses and rendered destitute. Adequate opportunity should be given to people to reschedule their loans with financial institutions. The Reserve Bank Act Chapter 173 must be amended in order to be supportive of indigenous people and stop regarding us as a high risk area as is the case now. The Reserve Bank Board must be changed in order to put in place more effective blacks who protect the interests of indigenous people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the light of the above, urgent action needs to be taken to substantially increase indigenous participation in the financial sector. The measures should include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Where the government has majority shareholding, the financial institutions must be given clear directives to support and fund indigenous companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Government should either introduce legislation to regulate the use of pension funds and insurance investments for the benefit of indigenous people who in any case are the major contributors to these funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At all times government must make available loans at concessionary rates of interest to indigenous people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurance and pension funds should be used for the development of indigenous businesses and the construction of factory shells where indigenous businesses can operate from. The largest mutual society in insurance business is Old Mutual with $12 billion assets. If only 10 percent of the Old Mutual funds were earmarked for the indigenous programme it will amount to $1.2 Billion. But for this to happen government must be serious about the indigenisation programme in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to this time, 16 years after independence the board of directors of Old Mutual is still nominated by interests in South Africa. The general manager and the actuary are nominated by South African interests with the Commissioner of Insurance and Registrar of Pension and Provident Funds only rubber- stamping these nominations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister of Finance and Attorney-General should examine the special responsibilities and principal functions of the Commissioner of Insurance as stipulated in Part 11 and Part 111 of the Insurance Act of 1987, with a view to ensuring that black Zimbabweans are appointed as general manager and chairman of Old Mutual as a condition of acceptance of the mutual society to function in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ideally the issue of non-banking and mobilisation of insurance funds in particular should be reviewed under a broad policy sweep. The government of Zimbabwe can legitimately exercise the following of its prerogatives:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Review the position of the chief executive and chairman of Old Mutual and ask the present board to set a panel of interviewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*The nomination of the actuary at the end of the expiry of the incumbent's (tenure) to be that of indigenous citizens who will be sympathetic to the development objectives and goals of Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality of the management of Old Mutual is that the board is not autonomous. Control is still vested in the South African board of Old Mutual who appoint the local board of directors. Zimbabwe should look at the internal incorporation of Old Mutual as a matter of urgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through a regulatory mechanism foreign investment should be directed to ensure qualitative indigenous participation of at least 61 percent. The chairman of such a company and even a foreign owned company must be Indigenous. There should be areas exclusively left for indigenous businesses.  While foreign investment is welcome, it should not be accepted at the expense of our sovereignty and the indigenisation of the national economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aim of foreign investment should be to complement local indigenous investment. Too much is being done to promote foreign investment and very little is being done to promote local, i.e indigenous investment. This goes against the grain and logic of who we want to promote in order to control our nation s economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No permits for safari camps, tour operators, hunting concessions, etc.  should be renewed and given to non-indigenous people in order to enable indigenous people to now enter this foreign currency earning sector. This area remains a preserve for whites and foreign multinationals at present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This sector needs to be urgently de-racialised. The sector is dominated by white minority entrepreneurs. Indigenous participation in the sector is limited mainly to government participation. The main factors impeding indigenisation include: unavailability of land; limited access to finance; restrictive legislation. In addition, government should also put in place a package of incentives and deliberate policies for affirmative action to encourage and promote the entry of indigenous entrepreneurs into small and medium enterprises in the sector. There is need to urgently review existing legislation in order to ensure that it does impede the participation in the sector by indigenous people. Tourist training facilities should be expanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concentration of activity in the construction sector is among a small number of large and medium sized members of the Construction Industry Federation of Zimbabwe (CIFOZ) which is largely white, which accounts for 75 percent total construction sector domestic turnover despite the existence of many small indigenous contractors who largely belong to the Zimbabwe Building Contractors Association (ZBCA). Apart from racist attitudes prevailing in the sector, other constraints to indigenisation include: shortage of skilled manpower; inadequate financial resources and obsolete plant and equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More indigenous people should be allowed to become stock brokers and a parallel stock exchange which deals in indigenous securities only should be established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy objectives articulated in the economic reform programme as outlined in the budget are: the reduction of central government deficit from 10 percent to 5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by fiscal year 1994/95; reform of public enterprises to include a series of measures aimed at eliminating the large budgetary burden of the public enterprise sector by making the public enterprises more efficient; moving away from a centralised system of allocating foreign exchange to a fully market based system through trade liberalisation; liberalisation of price controls and relaxation of labour controls; investment promotion and domestic deregulation; monetary and financial sector reform; and implementation of a social dimensions of adjustment programme to assist the poor and vulnerable members of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest pressure that our government faces is that of indigenising this economy and creating employment. It is therefore important that we look at our priorities and allocate resources through the national budget in order to achieve the objective. There is need for a parallel programme to assure the indigenous people a stake in the economy so that they can feel supportive of ESAP and its overall objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proposal points to areas that should receive attention in the indigenisation programme. Without specific policies and measures parallel to ESAP, the indigenous sector can easily be obliterated and marginalised under the new economic framework. Because the indigenous sector is still fragile, indigenisation should also involve the promotion and consolidation of the public sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government officials should not continue to make recommendations which commit the nation on matters that cause us undue hardships. Consultation should be made with more indigenous people as opposed to only consulting with white lobby groups and at the same time yielding to their so-called public pressure. ESAP should not be pursued at the expense of indigenous people. The little that indigenous people had is being lost. We need to learn to protect our interests and not simply adopt and run with programmes which undermine, weaken and interfere with the consolidation of our economic nationhood. We are continuing to borrow offshore funds at low interest rates in order to support the protection of foreign companies by importing goods from outside while our local companies are being rendered uncompetitive because of high interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government should give work to black consultants and stop favouring foreign consultants who are not knowledgeable about our economy and the problems of our people. We should like to see the immediate reversal of this trend in favour of our indigenous consultants including lawyers, accountants, doctors, etc, who in most cases are more qualified than these non-indigenous consultants. Parastatals and government departments should use indigenous lawyers, accountants, auditors, estate agents, insurance brokers etc. There should be a requirement that foreign donors and organisations should use local consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parastatals should be directed to implement affirmative action in awarding tenders to indigenous people. Shares in parastatals should be donated to the National Investment Trust Fund. Parastatals should not be sold to foreigners, since that amounts to selling the indigenous birth right of indigenous people.  Joint ventures between indigenous entrepreneurs and foreign entities should be encouraged particularly in the proposed Export Processing Zones provided indigenous people control 61 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Persons appointed to parastatal boards and other boards are expected to represent government and in the course become instruments of policy changes including implementation of the same. By virtue of their appointment by government as part of its affirmative action (hitherto known as black advancement) some of these indigenous appointees have now turned out to be Uncle Toms while others are simply downright cowards who are afraid of changing the status quo. Under the guise of professionalism some of these representatives unashamedly turn against government and start to actively represent white people s interests in return for a few or no favours at all.  Government should as a matter of urgency review the whole list of these appointments with a view to changing representatives to such boards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some government officials blindly recommend and support programmes which seek to transfer power government to market forces/whites. Such activities amount to an abdication of responsibility and national duty. The market forces are: multinationals - white; large companies - white; white associations and white cartels; white lobby groups; a white stock exchange which is made up of 60 percent Old Mutual, 30 percent pension funds and 10 percent other. Blacks are consumers whose powers can only be exercised precariously in a consumer boycott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having established white controlled economic and trade associations whites lobbied for power to be transferred from government ministries to these associations (i.e the market ) in order to perpetuate racial economic control of the economy by a minority group. It should be noted that many of these associations have cornered lucrative economic sectors including all activities linked to exports. It should also be remembered that a lot of economic acts of Parliament were amended just before independence and power/control was removed from government and transferred to white controlled associations. Some of these associations even took with them government assets through such schemes. Government should de-recognise all economic associations and let the proposed Indigenisation Commission reconstitute these associations with indigenous mandates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been a lot of lobbying to impress upon government to reduce its expenditure. As part of this exercise expenditure on health, education and the civil service is supposed to be reduced and it is wrongly proposed that parastatals should be sold. Consequently the power and control which black people have through their government would then be transferred to whites or white associations and as a result economically voting out the little control that we have on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically none of these pressure groups is highlighting the issue of government revenue. Surprisingly all these lobbies are silent about the billions of dollars which government is losing through transfer pricing by members of their associations. For example, government is losing more than $3.  4 billion a year in the tobacco exports alone through such practices. It is a known fact that economic security and national security are interwoven.  Activities of this nature which are intended to undermine government s capacity to support and sustain its national obligations should be viewed very seriously because they are ultimately intended to weaken and destroy our government and its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the extent to which advertisers who in the main are white controlled companies with dominating representation in the Advertising Media Association (ADMA), it is not correct to believe that all privately owned and some of the government newspapers express completely independent views. Both the editorial and advertising policies of even some newspapers in which government is a shareholder appear to be tailor made to advance and protect white minority interest groups who continue to control 98 percent of the economy. It is easy to note that the papers are now preparing blacks psychologically and mentally for both economic and political surrender to whites. For example a number of white owned institutions in this country have broken the law by conducting chimbadzo. On a daily basis the newspapers carry adverts of houses owned by blacks being repossessed. Most of these houses being repossesed have been the result of illegal interest on interest being charged by these financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When requests were made to place adverts highlighting this practice white people protested to their colleagues in the media and were assured that such adverts would not run in spite of government being the majority shareholder of some of the papers. Topics and issues concerning the indigenisation of the economy are totally omitted by some of the papers. When issues of indigenisation are being published it is only in the context of either condemning or undermining them. We have always expected our national media to uphold and defend the ideals of the broad masses of Zimbabweans.  Unfortunately this does not seem to be happening. It is important that our vision and the ideals which were born during the liberation struggle for political independence, black economic empowerment, national unity and stability should continue to be upheld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are now fed up of our national media trying to lead and manipulate our government s thinking on matters concerning foreign investment. Publishing, upholding and supporting views of racist whites and their fronts appears to be the ultimate of what constitutes Press Freedom these days. The composition of all media boards where government has an interest in the media should be urgently reviewed and reconstituted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The budget is an instrument which government should use in a bold manner to allocate and direct resources in order to achieve its objectives. Some of the objectives to be achieved in the short term are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Employment creation and entry of indigenous people into the economy by providing an environment for sustainable domestic and indigenous led investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Create markets and opportunities for indigenous participation and economic empowerment in the main stream productive sectors and transform the imbalance in the ownership structure of assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Promote decentralised economic growth and support rural development thus effectively distributing wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Implementation of an effective land resettlement and water harvesting programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the above, government should take measures and allocate resources through the budget in order to achieve these objectives. We have had standstill budgets for too long. Such budgets obviously preserve the status quo which is most unacceptable. The Credit Guarantee Company should be turned into a development commercial bank. It already has the money and what is left is for it to open up branch offices in all provinces. Government should set aside $2 billion this year for indigenisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest market in Zimbabwe is provided by government. Government is the biggest buyer of goods and services in the country and is therefore the biggest market with close to $8 billion to spend for such goods and services.  This market should be made available to indigenous businesses through a deliberate affirmative action policy. There is no doubt that the affirmative action policy implemented by the Ministry of Public Construction has provided a sure entry for indigenous businesses in this sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tenders below $25 million should be competed for by indigenous businesses only. A vigorous programme in implementing the affirmative action policy in the awarding of tenders at district, provincial and national level should be pursued. Tender committees should be set up at district , provincial and national levels in order to monitor the implementation of the affirmative action policy. At the moment government does not have a mechanism of monitoring implementation of the affirmative action policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospitals and government institutions should give preference to women, cooperatives and youth groups when making purchases of goods and services which can be obtained within their local areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A National Productivity Centre should be set up. The centre will focus on looking at what can be produced in our country, and establishing the local and export markets for the products in advance in the same way as how the growing and marketing of tobacco is done. This function can be given to the Planning Commission, Ministry of Industry and Commerce and Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioned greenfield manufacturing projects to qualify for a five year tax moratorium, to allow cash flow stabilisation. Uncollectable taxes from indigenous traders in rural areas to be written off. Allowance of death duties should be increased to $1 million to take account of the inflation and devaluation of the Zimbabwe dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duties and taxes on imports of machinery and capital equipment by indigenous people to be waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Critics of structural adjustment programmes always complain about meddling by the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs) the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. They claim that these institutions second their advisers to the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance to keep tabs on what is happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this applies to Zimbabwe, then the BWI advisers must be on a honeymoon, probably spending most of their time at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe chalets at Juliasdale as claimed by The Herald.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far the BWIs have given Zimbabwe an almost clean slate. Apart from failing to trim the large civil service, controlling government expenditure and failing to meet targets set under the first phase of the Economic Structural Adjustment Programme, they claim the country has not yet been thrown to the dogs. It can be salvaged. All they won't give it is balance of payment support.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But investigations by The Insider have just revealed that not only is the government failing to control expenditure and to collect all the revenue due to the State --although tax officers have just launched a door-to-door inspection and collection campaign--but it is also failing to properly account for that little revenue it gets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Insider has just discovered that up to now accounts for the financial year ending June 1995 have not yet been audited, yet the Audit and Exchequer Act clearly stipulates that this should be carried out by March 31 each year.  In this case the audit should have been completed by March 31, 1996. As a result, the country is literally groping in the dark not certain whether the money allocated in 1994-95, and in 1995-96 was properly used or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1996-97 financial year has already gone eight months and it is only four months before another budget. Unfortunately the main culprit is the government s financial manager, the Ministry of Finance. It is reliable understood that treasury held up the audit because it only submitted accounts for the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the year ending June 1995 in January this year. Apparently the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor- General is charged to this Consolidated Revenue Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to section 31 of the Audit and Exchequer Act, unless the treasury otherwise directs, all appropriation accounts should be closed and the financial returns should be submitted to treasury within one month after the end of the financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means treasury should have the final returns at least by the beginning of August. Returns to the Comptroller and Auditor-General should be submitted within two months. Treasury should prepare and submit to the Comptroller and Auditor-General statements of account showing the transactions of the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the financial position of the State within four months after the end of the financial year. This means the accounts submitted in January this year should have been submitted by the end of October 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Comptroller and Auditor-General is equally to blame. He has the powers to summon any officer and is entitled to receive &quot;without undue delay from that officer&quot; any information he requires to discharge his duties. The Insider also understands that the Auditor-General can close his books and prepare his report even if some accounting officers have not submitted their accounts. All he has to do is state this in his report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Comptroller and Auditor-General's report for the year ending June 30, 1991, the Auditor-General submitted his report on March 31, 1992 and clearly stated: This is the first time since independence that I have been able to meet the Statutory date of March 31. The credit goes to my staff for their dedication and commitment and of course to the cooperation I received from accounting officers . Team effort paid with the Auditor-General beating the deadline by 30 days for the year ending June 30, 1993 but the rot started creeping in. The audit for the year ending June 30, 1994 was five days late. It was signed on April 5, 1995. The 1995 audit has not yet been signed and it has to be tabled in Parliament before it can be made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers say even when the Auditor-General meets statutory requirements there is nothing to be proud of. &quot;Why should he brag about it when it takes his office six months to audit twelve months' work? After all, government ministries are required to submit their accounts to the Auditor-General two months after the end of the financial year and he is given six months after that to audit the same accounts. There is nothing to boast about. In fact, there must be something terribly wrong with the way his office operates.  Imagine a public company like Delta taking six months to audit its books, can that ever be acceptable?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a lot has been said about the need for Zimbabwe to be on the IMF s good books, there is now a strong belief that it is not the IMF money that Zimbabwe needs but the discipline that (comes) packaged with the IMF money .  The influential First Merchant Bank in its latest quarterly guide to the economy clearly states that by the end of this financial year, Zimbabwe will have gone nearly two years without the IMF s financial support -- 21 months to be exact. As a result the country has received reduced levels of funding from donor countries and aid agencies yet all indications are that its economy is booming. As a country, our real failing over the years has simply been our own lack of self-discipline. If the authorities and politicians had run our affairs with more accountability, our better managed resources would have been more than sufficient to promote the needed economic growth, the bank says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the country appearing to be heading for an economic boom, the delay in finalising the audit may appear trivial but studies carried out by The Insider last year indicated that although fewer ministries were overspending the amount that they overspent had more than doubled in the four years between 1991 and 1994 -- the last year for which an audit is available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While seven ministries out of 25 exceeded their allocations by $113.7 million in 1991, four ministries out of 25 overspent by $269.1 million the following year. Although the figure declined to $46.2 million in 1993, it shot up to $241.7 million in 1994. During the four years 14 out of 22 ministries overspent in at least one year. The worst culprits were the ministries of Home Affairs, Public Construction and National Housing, Finance, Transport and Foreign Affairs. The 1995 audit would therefore show whether there has been any improvement in the financial management of taxpayers' money by these ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another aspect that should be of interest to all taxpayers is how the drought levy is being used. It is not yet clear where the funds are being allocated as it had been hinted that the Grain Marketing Board might be involved. Former Finance Minister Ariston Chambati once said that part of the money would be used to buy strategic reserves while the bulk would be kept as cash reserves because it was costly to keep food reserves physically. There are strong fears that these cash reserves are not reflected in the government balance sheet. There are some whispers that since the government is usually short of cash, treasury might have used the money to pay off some of government s running expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the last audit report, there are two funds related to drought: the National Drought Fund and the National Drought Relief Fund. As of June 30, 1994 the National Drought Fund, which was established to alleviate the effects of drought and other natural hazards adversely influencing food security and to promote the development of food production designed to counteract drought and/or purposes incidental thereto, had $31.7 million made up of $19.5 million in cash at the bank, $5.3 million in interest and nearly $7 million in investments. No expenditure was incurred from the fund with the cost of administering the fund, estimated at $6 250 being met from votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the National Drought Relief Fund also set up to alleviate the effects of drought and other natural hazards adversely influencing food security and to promote the development of food production designed to counteract drought and for purposes incidental thereto , there was $13.5 million as at June 30, 1994 with $10.7 million in cash at the bank and $2.8 million in advances to projects. This fund had nearly $27 million the previous year and $13.4 million was spent on projects which were not spelt out in the report.  Although smaller than the National Drought Fund it was more costly to administer. Administration expenses, which were met from votes were estimated at $20 750.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another thing that is worrying financial administrators is that the delay in finalising the 1995 audit means a delay in assessing the real impact of the Stop-Payment System which was introduced by the government in the 1995-96 financial year. Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa in announcing his current budget implied that the system was working and, for the first time, ministries had managed to keep within their budgets. Public companies, however, clearly said this was not entirely true because some of them especially those in the construction industry reported that their operations had been severely affected by the stop-payment system as government departments had not paid for goods already supplied or their clients could not pay them because they in turn had not been paid by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one insider, the delay in auditing the government finances could also result in the wrong accounting officers being blamed. This is what happened in the case of Home Affairs Secretary Tineyi Chigudu. He was blamed for something that had been done by his predecessor. The audit report has to be debated in Parliament. If it is finally released the 1995 audit will be debated in 1997 and MPs might blame the wrong permanent secretary if there have been changes in the ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it appears no one really cares. Even Parliament, which is supposed to be the watchdog, and to which the Auditor-General is answerable, has not been barking. It has been approving budgetary allocations every year without insisting on finding out how money allocated the previous year was used. In fact, debate on some of the votes even appears to be a mockery if one closely scrutinises some of the government finances. One account, for example, has not been published since 1989 yet the department continues to be allocated money to cover its losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the last available Auditor-General's report accounts of the Central Mechanical Equipment Department (CMED) have not been published for the years ending June 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994. The report was for 1994. Until the release of the 1995 accounts it is impossible to know whether the CMED has finally published its accounts. The Harare International Conference Centre, which has become a popular venue for both local and international conferences, had also not published its accounts for the years ending 1992,1993 and 1994. The National Fund for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction was two years in arrears. It had not published its accounts for 1993 and 1994. The same applied to the Medical Stores Trading Account, the Village Community Workers Bicycle Revolving Fund, and the Settlement Loan Fund. The Social Development Fund was one year behind, and so were the Rosemary and Norman Levin Bursary Fund, the Vocational Training Loan Account and the Vocational Training Loan Fund. Parliament has therefore been approving funds into these accounts without knowing how the money is being used, and for years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Carel du Plessis' arrival on the coaching firmament is unlikely to mean a reprieve for deposed Springbok skipper Francois Pienaar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the new national coach is talking of a change in approach, which would mean yet another shift in thinking from South Africa's top players, the former Bok wing seems satisfied that the men who took the Boks through the end-of-year overseas tour unbeaten are the ones to beat the British Lions and win the Tri-Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will come as a huge relief to a playing staff who must be getting tired of the switching and changing which has seen four new Bok coaches in five years. Each new coach has different ideas on how the game should be played and which players are best equipped to do the job, and understandably a change in boss leads to uncertainty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the British Lions due in South Africa less than three months from now and the Tri-Nations to follow soon afterwards, upheaval at playing level is the last thing needed by a rugby nation desperate to wipe out the memory of last year's first-ever home series defeat by New Zealanby</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Plessis has promised to use form and merit as his sole criteria for selection and said the need to spread the playing resource base as wide as possible would of necessity include looking at those players who are seeking their fortune in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However he did not appear to think much of the prospect of a return to the frame for Pienaar and Joel Stransky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem is that there are question-marks over the standard of British club rugby and even if those players do perform well there we don't know how to judge their readiness for a test series,&quot; said Du Plessis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Super 12 is played at a much higher level than rugby in the northern hemisphere and that is where I expect the players to come from. To be honest with you, it is unlikely that we will call up a player who is not either playing in South Africa or in the Super 12.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if Du Plessis was not altogether sold on Andre Markgraaff's playing style, he does appear to have respect for his selections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The results at the end of last year speak for themselves. I want to keep the momentum going and I have no intention of making unnecessary disruptions to the squad at this stage. The players all came through well on last year's tour and as far as possible I would like to stick to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means Gary Teichmann is likely to remain as captain of a squad, which should retain its distinctly Natalian flavour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But although Teichmann yesterday described Du Plessis as a nice guy and pledged his 100 percent support for whoever was coaching the Boks, it remains to be seen how the players will react if Du Plessis' new style represents a major shift from that followed towards the end of the Markgraaff era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Plessis has described the Markgraaff way as one-dimensional, a view which is unlikely to be shared by those players weaned on a modern style of rugby which saw Natal rack up a record number of tries en route to the Currie Cup title last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present Du Plessis' new approach is known only to himself and those South African Rugby Football Union officials who backed his appointment ahead of more experienced candidates and even some who know him well fear that his much-spoken-of vision may be more romantic than practical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will only know once he has started coaching, but the management team he assembles around him could give us some indication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current assistant coaches Nick Mallett and Hugh Reece-Edwards, both forward- thinking modern students of the game, are avid disciples of the 90s flat-ball approach, and are unlikely to be satisfied with a fundamental shift from that which started to evolve on the tour of Argentina, France and Wales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both have expressed a desire to meet with Du Plessis before deciding on their future involvement with the national team as they quite rightly feel they cannot be attached to something they don't believe in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Plessis, for his part, has not gone as far as to say that he will dispense with direct rugby and it may be that he just intends mixing it up more (something Markgraaff himself was keen on) and introducing new options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that is the case, it would come as a significant boost to South Africa's chances of beating the Lions, Australia and New Zealand as it would entail less of an adjustment. As one official put it yesterday, South Africa, having made great progress towards the end of 1996, can ill-afford to return to square one again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Plessis intends to name his management team next week, but he has hinted at a change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to create any expectations, but I think there might be a change to the coaching,&quot; said Du Plessis, who added that he wanted to keep the basic management structure intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is a change, it seems Mallett, who many in top coaching circles felt was the ideal man to commandeer the Springbok ship, could be the one to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems Du Plessis favours former Bok flanker Gert Smal as his forward coach, which would mean no place for Mallett, regarded by many of those who were there as the real success story of late-1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Radical changes have to be made to the judicial system if more women are to be encouraged to report the crime of rape, women's organisations say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are unanimous in their call for major improvements in the handling of cases of violence against women, while acknowledging that some improvements have been made. In spite of the Government's promised intervention, there is no sign that the number of rapes are dropping.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial Rape Crisis director Carol Bower said it was &quot;very possible&quot; there had been an increase in reported rape in the Western Cape this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This could not necessarily be attributed to an increase in rape incidents as it was easier for women to report rape in the new South Africa, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A more &quot;user-friendly&quot; criminal justice system was vital in the fight against rape, said Western Cape Rape Crisis legal advisor Bronwyn Pithey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was one thing for Government departments to recognise in legislation that rape victims had to be handled more sensitively, but this had to filter down through training to police and prosecutors at ground level, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lifeline counselling manager Caron Erasmus said that during counselling rape victims displayed feelings of anger and helplessness. The decision whether or not to go ahead with a case was undermined by a feeling of powerlessness because of the functioning of the judicial system. Rape Crisis received an average of 90 rape-related calls a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of them (rape victims) decide not to prosecute because the system perpetuates these feelings and they are ambivalent whether or not it would help to go to court,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lisa Vetten, education co-ordinator for the Sexual Harassment Education Project in Gauteng, said there was a vast discrepancy between people convicted in indecent assault cases and rape cases (73 percent compared with 50 percent). The difference could be attributed to the onus on the State in rape cases to prove the victim did not consent to sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rape is the only crime where the State is obliged to prove the absence of consent. This means a victim has a better chance of getting a conviction with indecent assault,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She suggested rewording the definition of rape so that a woman could alter the charge to indecent assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She called for the moratorium on prosecution posts to be lifted and said a possible solution was a pool of private attorneys to be engaged on a contractual basis on rape cases. Few prosecutors were assigned regularly to rape cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics, she said, were needed on how long it took from the time a rape was reported to the end of the court case. Statistics were also needed on how many rape charges were reduced to common or sexual assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also time the State looked at establishing victims' advocates, who would offer support such as information on how a police investigation was proceeding and when the case was expected to get to court. &quot;At this stage the victim is only a witness in the case. Things need to be rebalanced so that the victim is regarded as being as important as the suspect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Pithey said it was encouraging that the Government was becoming more committed to the issue as a result of outspoken MPs and rape victims such as Nomboniso Gasa, who was raped on Robben Island, going publi South Africa suffered from a culture in which violence was seen as a means to resolve conflict and invariably the most vulnerable groups - women and children - were the victims, she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - New provincial traffic chief Sherman Amos, who started his new job at the beginning of the month, is determined to transform the image of his department in the eyes of road-users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Amos, 43, promised that phased-in changes &quot;are a-coming&quot; to change the department's image from a traffic &quot;force&quot; into a traffic &quot;service&quot; with high visibility. &quot;I intend adopting an approach which will see sweeping changes.  Don't get me wrong, it will not make personnel soft and there will still be law enforcement. We will still be on the lookout for people who wilfully disregard legislation .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Law enforcement will still be carried out but it will now be done in programmes tempered with controlled restraint and the ultimate goal will not be to issue tickets but rather to educate and advise,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the first innovations he plans will be a 24-hour help desk at the Gene Louw Traffic College in Brackenfell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will give help to all road-users, including pedestrians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff would be vigilant at all times, not just during the festive season and at Easter, when there were larger volumes of traffic on the roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The courts must also be encouraged to adopt tougher approaches to serious offenders, as in a recent hearing in Laingsburg in which a motorist was fined R9 000 when found guilty of reckless driving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Amos said his personnel had already pledged loyalty and support and he now sought the support of all road-users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As head of a department with a staff of about 400, he is required to make regular inspections of the 12 traffic centres across the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has to control an area extending from Cape Town to Sir Lowry's Pass, Grabouw, Knysna, Mossel Bay, Oudtshoorn and through the Karoo up to Beaufort West, as well as up the West Coast past Citrusdal and Clanwilliam to Lambert's Bay, and beyond Nuwerus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Amos is a former public prosecutor at Goodwood Magistrate's Court, has his B Juris degree from Unisa and a B Proc from the University of the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He never looked back after joining the traffic department of the Cape Divisional Council in Ottery in 1973. He joined the provincial administration's traffic wing in 1986. He was promoted to principal provincial traffic inspector in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the highlights of his career was a transfer in December 1995 to the National Department of Transport in Pretoria when he was promoted to deputy director in the directorate of traffic legislation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Olympic bid chief executive Chris Ball has sent a written apology to the Italian media to quell a storm of protest over suggestions that arch-rival Rome has been guilty of &quot;skulduggery and disinformation&quot; in the race for the Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With less than two weeks to go to the crucial shortlist selection in Lausanne, the bid company sought yesterday to placate Roman officials angered by suggestions they had had a hand in highlighting Cape Town's crime problems to their advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian media cried foul - one newspaper, Il Tempo, carried a report under the headline &quot;Olympic Poison from Cape Town&quot; - after a news agency report quoted Mr Ball as saying South Africa had been warned there would be &quot; all sorts of skulduggery, including disinformation&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also quoted him as saying: &quot;Rome is trying to knock us off. If Rome can persuade the world that Cape Town is not safe, Cape Town can't beat Rome. The IOC itself understands that crime is not an issue in the Games. The issue is security and Rome has bigger security problems than Cape Town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarks arose from Mr Ball's protest at the negative slant of agency reports on the International Olympic Committee evaluation commission's assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a carefully worded statement to the Italian media yesterday, Mr Ball said: &quot;A (news) report has come to my attention which attributes a number of inappropriate comments to myself regarding Rome. I would like to make it clear that the discussion referred to has been misunderstood and I apologise for any awkwardness that this may have caused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;We have had regular contact with representatives of the Italian media and they will know that the comments are inconsistent with the ongoing tenor of our communication.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Town bid team had &quot;consistently respected the integrity of the bidding process and I have personally ensured that we have followed both the letter and the spirit of the rules in this contest in every sense&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The saga is understood to have been discussed at talks yesterday between Sports Minister Steve Tshwete, head of the National Olympic Committee of SA Sam Ramsamy, Mr Ball and other officials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - What should have been the flight of a lifetime for hundreds of tourists coming to South Africa from London turned into a &quot;flight from hell&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days after taking off from Heathrow airport on what was supposed to be a 12-hour non-stop flight to Cape Town, they have yet to arrive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are due here later today - at least they hope so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their nightmare began when their South African Airways jumbo jet had technical difficulties after take-off which forced the pilot to make unscheduled landings leaving the passengers stranded in Paris, Zurich and Frankfurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAA spokeswoman Janie van Vuuren said all the passengers would arrive in Cape Town later today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The travellers boarded the ill-fated flight at Heathrow airport on Sunday but soon after take-off the pilot had problems with the wing flaps and decided to land at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passengers were taken to a hotel while technicians tried to rectify the fault. The aircraft took off on Monday evening, but the problem repeated itself and the pilot put down in Z/rich, Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A technical team from Johannesburg was called while the passengers were flown to Frankfurt to board another SAA flight to Cape Town. Arrangements were also made for some passengers to board other flights. Ms Van Vuuren said SAA had apologised profusely to the passengers for the inconvenience.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - South Africa could become the economic link between the booming economies of East Asia and South America, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa was between East Asia and South America and South Africa was strategically placed to serve as an important bridge on the continent - just as Singapore did in East Asia, Mr Goh said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa could begin by allowing airlines to fly freely in its airspace, Mr Goh, who also discussed the matter with President Mandela, said his suggestion went beyond just airlines and included other trade and economic areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that South Africa should not depend on aid, but find the right economic strategies to take the country forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Goh said yesterday Singapore was a hub in East Asia, where exciting growth was taking place. In Singapore's next growth phase, it would be looking at investing its capital elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said South America, which had growth rates of up to seven percent and low inflation, was one of the options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Singapore was admired worldwide for its economic successes and it was a challenge to South Africa &quot;to see if we can emulate your example&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high-level Singaporean delegation, which arrived in South Africa on Monday, included 40 businessmen scouting for investment opportunities, and several senior government members. Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad said the talks indicated the growing ties between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Singapore's National Development Minister, Lim Hing Kiang, welcomed South Africa's focus on Asia, and said government agreements between the two countries had also been discussed. The South African delegation at the talks included Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus and Deputy Trade and Industry Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Goh also met Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Western Cape Premier Hernus Kriel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A state banquet in his honour took place at Tuynhuys last night. He is visiting Robben Island today and will have talks with Deputy President Mbeki before leaving for Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Pepkor's supermarket chain Shoprite Checkers is getting ready to break into the financial services market later this year, but has not yet chosen a banking partner, managing director Whitey Basson says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Basson said finishing touches were being put to Shoprite's in-store technology and the systems would be ready in June or July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial services could grow to be &quot;a good part&quot; of Shoprite's business, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have 25 million customers a year. We can sell them baked beans or we can sell them funeral policies. Even if we have a hit rate of 10 percent, we can sell two million policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would shop around for the best financial services deal for his customers, Mr Basson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on Pick 'n Pay's plans to offer financial services through Boland Bank, he said though Boland Bank and Shoprite had a common chairman and controlling shareholder in Pepkor head Christo Wiese, &quot;I do what is good for my customers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boland Bank would be in the running as a partner, but so would other banks, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shoprite beat tough retailing conditions with a 20 percent increase in operating profits to R107 million in the six months to December. Turnover was up 28 percent, boosted by the takeover of Sentra last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sentra's profit-to-turnover ratios, which Mr Basson said were 50 percent lower than Shoprite's, limited the half-year profit growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investment income jumped from R23,6 million to R43 million, though the rise was partly offset by climbing finance charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attributable profit was up 81 percent to R103 million, swelled by exceptional items - compensation for the cancellation of a lease and income from the sale of land and buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Basson said he expected similar growth in trading profits in the second half year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shoprite had done well to raise profit margins from two percent to more than 2,2 percent in spite of tough competition, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would not be drawn on the group's expansion plans, noting only that up to 10 more supermarkets would be opened in South Africa this year, though none of them in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's seven Zambian supermarkets were maintaining &quot;acceptable&quot; turnover levels and profit margins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Other opportunities in Africa are being investigated and our first supermarket in Mozambique will open in June.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Basson said one possible use for Shoprite's R423-million cash hoard was the financing of further expansion into Africa. South African financial institutions were not always willing to take this on, he said, and Shoprite needed to fund its own growth into the rest of Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A self-confessed paedophile who has admitted having an uncontrollable desire to rape very young children and babies has been let loose in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows a blunder by British police, who mistakenly assumed he would be arrested in South Africa after his deportation from Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when he arrived here on Saturday after being flown under guard from Britain, where he served a sentence for a sex-related charge, he was allowed to go free, as he faces no charges here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean-born Dennis Hundermark, 49, was delivered to Cape Town police at the city's airport by three burly Scotland Yard detectives who said he was a dangerous man who posed a constant threat to young children and to himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundermark travelled to Europe last February hoping to star in child sex videos, but was convicted in Britain for &quot;incitement to procure a girl under 21&quot; after an undercover detective posed as a video producer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was also convicted for stealing a girl's panties, which he was wearing when he was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after serving only three months of his 16-month sentence, Hundermark, who has South African and Zimbabwean citizenship and carries a South African passport, was released from a British prison on Friday and deported to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he arrived about 10am on Saturday, Cape Town Child Protection Unit officer Jacci Storm questioned him briefly but could not find a reason to hold him, although he had allegedly admitted raping a nine-year-old girl at least 12 times in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundermark was then driven to a hotel in the northern areas and, according to Inspector Storm, he was thought to be heading for Harare, where he has relatives. Detective-Inspector Andy Hewett of Scotland Yard, one of the three London policeman who escorted Hundermark to South Africa, said he had attended the trial and was horrified by Hundermark's admissions in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hundermark told the court that he was sick and needed help,&quot; said Inspector Hewett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His fantasies included having sex with babies in nappies and raping toddlers, no matter whether they were boys or girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said he was like a speeding train waiting to crash and admitted in court it was a matter of time before he did it again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspector Hewett said Hundermark was a danger to children anywhere in the world and should be behind bars. During their investigation, British authorities learned about his many &quot;brushes with the law&quot; allegedly involving child sex in several other European countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scotland Yard was convinced South African police had strong cases against Hundermark and he would be arrested the moment he had set foot here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hundermark himself believed that he was heading for jail here in South Africa,&quot; said Inspector Hewett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But police at the airport did not even know about us bringing the man.  Only later a Child Protection Unit detective arrived and questioned him briefly and then he was driven to a hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hundermark couldn't believe his luck. He was ecstatic that he was actually free to go,&quot; said Inspector Hewett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western Cape Child Protection Unit acting commander Jan Swart said he had checked police records thoroughly and established that Hundermark was not a wanted man in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I sincerely hope he is a rehabilitated person because one step over the line will land him behind bars,&quot; said Captain Swart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My advice to him is to get help if he needs it so he will not become our client.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Move aside Miami, here comes Cape Town. Beautiful beaches, spectacular drives and a phenomenal pool of talented people are turning Cape Town into one of the top international modelling destinations. SARAH YOUNG investigates for Living Africa magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be an idea to spend a few moments meditating before venturing into Cape Town's streets - just to make sure you have your cool in place. There are so many gorgeous people around that a simple stroll could be hazardous to your health...twisting your neck, falling over your feet, that kind of thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the arrival of Boss Models, for instance. The international agency that claims to have virtually created the male super-model has landed in Cape Town with a stable of international modelling talent that includes the likes of Marcus Schenkenberg and Joel West (two of the Claudia Schiffers of the male modelling world).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communications director Paul West says the company has hopes its Cape Town agency will do as well, or better than, its Miami, New York and London offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're here because there's an untapped talent pool here, and I don't just mean models. You have very good make-up artists, photographers, stylists,&quot; the list goes on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's also a beautiful location that the rest of the world hasn't seen.  You've been shut off from rest of the world for years, it's like the land time forgot. Everyone is talking about South Africa, especially in the States.  There's a lot of frenzy to see what all this talk is about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have beauty here that's unparalleled. Our clients have never seen anywhere as beautiful as Cape Town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West says Boss isn't just here to make a quick buck, though. The gorgeous guys and gals have joined environmental activists and Muslim spiritual leaders in a bid to stop developers from building on the pristine slopes of Table Mountain. In early January this year, on an icy cold day, naked Boss models crept up into the wet fynbos, just as the sun was rising and launched &quot; Models for the Mountain&quot;. Their aim: to make the preservation of one of the country's most beautiful features fashionable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Models who pull in R3 000 and R15 000 a day offered their services free, as did everyone else involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mountain's already been a backdrop for a number of Boss and other international shoots. Esquire, The Face and GQ are just some of those who've already come to the city. West says: &quot;The reason they're able to come here now is that we can offer them the type of service an agency in New York or London would offer. I think that because of our resources worldwide we can help develop the whole market in Cape Town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes that in future South African models will be able to base themselves in Cape Town and still work internationally. In the past, they've been forced to go to cities such as New York and Milan because South Africa was too much of a backwater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He doesn't see Cape Town's star waning in the near future. &quot;This isn't like some small American town that's suddenly hit the news and is going to disappear just as quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locals say the changes have an incredible impact on their lives. Rory Sales is your proverbial tall, dark, handsome guy. In the late Seventies he began modelling when the television commercial industry was in its infancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was one of the chunky young men who brought South Africa the &quot;braaivleis, rugby, sunny skies and Chevrolet&quot; ad, among others. This was the beginning of a career which later saw him working as a lackey in the blossoming local film industry and modelling in the States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is generally positive about the new developments, but adds a word of caution. &quot;People see the glamour, but they have no idea of the hard work that lies behind that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the early 1990s, he and wife Cath have run a successful production company from their Noordhoek home. Sitting on the balcony of his office, overlooking the fynbos and five kilometres of pristine beach, Sales talks about the development of the film and commercial industry in Cape Town and how it's affected people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up until about 1990 being in the film or modelling industry in South Africa probably meant you were in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granted, in the early Seventies there was a small international ad industry in Cape Town. Ashley Lazarus, who's now based in New York was then directing Peter Stuyvesant ads in the Mother City. And in the mid-Seventies John Young saw the beginning of what he believed would be a vibrant film and commercial industry blossoming in the city and started a lighting company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the National Party government decided it would at long last permit television broadcasting in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales explains: &quot;In the late Eighties the South African movies industry boomed. But it was an artificial, tax-driven boom that didn't spark much life into the commercial industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political changes of the early Nineties gave the country's film and commercial industry its first real boost in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surprisingly, he says the low rand value is not top of the list of the city's attractions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The low rand is offset against high hotel and car hire prices and the relatively high cost of flights from Europe. Shooting costs are also rising faster than the rate of inflation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says that as the rand drops locals are upping their prices, rather than leaving them low and offering foreign companies a sexier deal. He believes if the rand gets stronger a lot of business could be lost because local have become too expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem foreign companies face when they shoot here, is that they're expected to get work permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These super tourists are expected to go through the schlepp of getting work permits for the privilege of spending between R100 000 and R300 000 a day here,&quot; Sales says. Late last year, the stills industry managed to get this changed so that people shooting for magazines and catalogues now only needed business permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film industry is lobbying for the same sort of deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales says &quot;the fantastic diversity of talent and looks&quot; in the city is part of the reason for this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another of the city's main attractions is its diversity of locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past year, Ridley Scott Associates and Tony Kay - who shot the Gatorade sports drink ad - are just two of the big names that have graced the city with their illustrious presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vogue recently did a couple of shoots in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreigners such as Frenchman Philippe Marinig of Picto photo lab are also setting up shop here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's the spin-off of these developments for Cape Town and its people?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locals in the industry agree it goes way beyond foreigners coming here, shooting commercial and leaving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The industry gives work to literally thousands of people, from those selling clothes and curios, to car hire firms and hotel,&quot; says Sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zane's another Capetonian who began his career as a model. About five years ago he went out on his own with Outlaw. &quot;It wouldn't have been possible before that because the market was very closed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says Cape Town is definitely a &quot;hot spot to shoot,&quot; but there are gaps in the industry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AYSSAITA (ENA) - Members of the Ayssaita woreda council demanded the launching of the agricultural extension programme in Afar National Regional State in view of its significance for food self-sufficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement they issued at the end of a day-long conference held last Saturday, members of the council said the woreda economic development office should be strengthened in manpower in a bid to organize farmers in the region for the extension programme .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said, through the Ayssaita Woreda boasts wide fertile land, the efforts made to harness the Awash River for irrigation development is insignificant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ato Mehammed Al Hamid, head of the regional agricultural bureau, preparation is underway to launch the programme in the region as of next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the property administration and general services section head under the regional department of agriculture disclosed that agricultural machinery the afar people received from the federal government are exposed to damage due to mishandling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the head, the equipment exposed to damages include tractors and their parts, water pumps, generators, mills and welding machines used by the former state farms in Ayssaita, Date Bahri and Middle Awash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head said eventhough the Afar agricultural development task force set up in the second half of 1994 took charge of the machinery in Ayssaita and Date Bahri, it is now impossible to correctly figure their number because of the dissolution of the force after its subsidy was suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, the task force set up by the regional council to administer the agricultural machinery in Middle Awash failed to get 110,000 birr it requested for storing the equipment at a spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Musa Ahmed, agricultural department head of zone 3, said machinery worth over seven million birr are exposed to damages in Defen Belhamo and Meteka warehouses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the items exposed to damages because of mishandling some water pumps are illegally used by individuals, the head added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Awol Arba, economic sector head of the regional council, said a task force will be set up to collect the said machinery and conduct study on ways of developing 15,000 hectares of land.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - A prosecution witness said the late Dejazmatch Kassa Wolde-Mairiam, a senior official in the then Ministry of Pen, a one time university president, an administrator and minister of agriculture during the reign of Emperor Haile-Selassie was imprisoned following his arrival here to answer a call made over the radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness in a testimony he gave yesterday to the Federal High Court said he knew the late dejazmatch, his cousin, since 1959 and related how he was jailed after his return in July or August 1974 from Bako where he was engaged in agricultural activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he said he was supplying the deceased up until July 1979 at the headquarters of the Fourth Army Division and that of the Derg till the time he was told to stop bringing supplies by the prison. since then he has never set eyes on him, he added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had easily identified the remains of the late dejazmatch among the five bodies exhumed in 1992 on the premises of the residence of Ras Asirate Kassa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 132nd witness on his part said he had been catering for the late patriarch, Abune Tewoflos of the Ethiopian orthodox church until July 1979.  since then, for several years, he had no idea about the wherabouts of the late patriarch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had been at the spot and identified the remains of Abune Tewoflos when the exhumation of the bodies took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Special Prosecutor has requested the court to postpone the hearing of testimonies of five witnesses on grounds that the issues they raise might be of concern to the 44th defendant, Lieutenant Getahun Tekle-Mariam presently admitted to a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence lawyers has also reinforced the point saying he prefers the testimonies to be heard in the presence of his client.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwean economists would relish projections of a slow down in population growth since this would mean prosperity as resources would be distributed among fewer people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not when the cause of slow down is a higher death rate and lower fertility due to HIV and AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is why the report by the Blair Research Institute of Harare and Oxford University of London predicting that Zimbabwe's population of 11.5 million would remain static or even decline during the next 20 years, due to the deadly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has caused shock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be helpful if the population stopped growing but not this way,&quot; said well-known economist John Robertson. &quot;This will mean the deaths of many people before they contribute to the growth of the economy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers Tom Zhuwau and Stephen Chandiwana of the Blair Research Institute and Simon Gregson and Roy Anderson of Oxford University, in a pioneering study, have concluded that a combination of increased deaths due to AIDS and a falling birth rate will sharply reduce Zimbabwe's population growth rate pegged at 3.1 percent in the last census.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life expectancy would drop from the current 57 years to 30 years.  Zimbabwe's population was expected to reach 16 million by the year 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social communications secretary of the Catholic Bishops Conference, Father Oskar Wermter's reaction to the results of the study on the socio- demographic impact of HIV was more striking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My first reaction is simply one of shock,&quot; he said. &quot;The dry figures and statistics of this report hide much suffering and many personal tragedies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Surely losing a large part of our young adult population with their education and vocational skills, their roles as parents and carers for the next generation can only be very bad and most depressing news,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So devastating has been the findings that parliament is preparing for debate on the forecast HIV/AIDS tragedy, according to the chairperson of the Select Committee on Service Ministries, Angeline Masuku. Her team is studying the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although conceding that the findings will only come to pass if intermediate determinants remain constant, notably that if Zimbabweans do not change their behavior and that no cure for aids is found soon, the researchers say they do not mind painting their scenarios in strong primary colors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time we looked at the problem in the face and did something about it, be it in behavioral change or coming up with the appropriate policies,&quot; Zhuwau said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most disturbing aspect of the findings is the distortion in the population age/sex structure. Researchers project that there will be more people in their teens and early adulthood while the experienced and economically more important 30-59 year age-group will be drastically reduced by the year 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, because women tend to get infected at an earlier age (because for economic reasons women generally marry men who are older and already infected) there is likely to be a shortage of females over time at young adult ages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researchers also noted a decline in fertility, that is the average number of children born to every woman of child-bearing age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reasons for the decline, which could be attributed to the prevalence of HIV, included increased use of condoms, delay in marriage due to fear of HIV, and that parents who would have lost a child due to HIV would not want to have another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strongest criticism of the study has been the size of the sample population (929 households) and the justification for extrapolating the results to cover the whole country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people might think the sample population was too small for Zimbabwe,&quot; said Dr Lazarus Zanamwe, a lecturer in population studies, department of geography, at the University of Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zanamwe also questioned the projection that the population might actually decline, saying according to some models, the national fertility rate of 4.2- 4.3 percent was sufficient to sustain a population growth in the face of HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also questioned the projection that the population would be made up largely of teenagers and young adults, saying even these are at risk from current infections unless there was change in behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justifying the extension of the results from the study area to the whole country, Gregson said the results from the study area were not different from what the National AIDS Control Program had established for the whole country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was supported by John Smith, an actuary with the First Mutual Life Assurance Society of Zimbabwe. He said the projections were consistent with those that had been done by the Actuarial Society of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those projections portrayed the Zimbabwean situation as being worse than in South Africa but better than in Zambia and Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robertson also supported the findings, saying they reinforced statistics from other parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling on population planners to carefully study the report, Father Wermter said the church should also intensify its AIDS and Family Life Education Programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The church will also insist that we invest not so much into negative measures like population control but into positive programs like education, especially of women and girls, health and vocational training, supported by a moral renewal, stressing values like self-discipline, honesty, respect for human rights and solidarity,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While other critics might dismiss the report as an academic generalization, the fact remains that Zimbabwe has already started experiencing a higher mortality rate due to AIDS, which causes an estimated 500 deaths per week, according to estimates by the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Heavy rains in the central Mozambican province of Zambezia are causing flooding on the Licungo River, which runs through the province's second largest town, Mocuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued Wednesday, the National Water Board said that 92.7 millimeters of rain fell on Mocuba, Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accumulated rainfall over the past six days was 234.9 millimeters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The level of the Licungo at Mocuba rose from 7.05 meters (7.71 yards) Monday to 7.7 meters (8.4 yards) Tuesday morning. This is 50 centimeters higher than the maximum level reached by the Licungo during flooding in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board warns that flooding in the Licungo basin will worsen, and urges the local authorities to ensure that people living near the river banks are evacuated to safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flooding on the Licungo follows an improvement in the situation in the Zambezi, Pungue and Buzi valleys, farther south, where there was severe flooding earlier February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 300,000 people were affected by that flooding in the provinces of Sofala, Manica, Tete and Zambezia, and 78 people were known to have lost their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The floods had swamped 7,300 houses and 79,520 hectares (19,494 acres) of crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mozambican government on Monday appealed to the international community for emergency aid valued at almost 30 million U.S. dollars to assist the victims and to repair flood damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao launched the appeal at a meeting in Maputo with representatives of donor countries and organizations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GABORONE, Botswana (PANA) - The 18 heads of Commonwealth African states, who have been holding round table talks in Gaborone, shifted Wednesday to Kasane, a resort near the border with Zambia, to finalize their discussion on ways to enhance democracy and good government on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crucial talks will mostly be held behind closed doors, officials said Wednesday in Gaborone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a banquet hosted for the Commonwealth leaders Tuesday Botswana's president, Ketumile Masire, urged his counterparts to take measures to improve Africa's tarnished image.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are convinced that this meeting should not be allowed to pass as an event. It should be seen as the beginning of a process which entail constant nurturing until it bears the fruit which all our people can enyoy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is essential that Africa has a problem of a negative image. This stems from the international news media often concentrating their coverage on the negative developments in Africa. Botswana's view is that this negative image can only be reversed by establishing democratic and transparent institutions,&quot; Masire said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Botswana believed strongly in regional cooperation and that a number of conflicts, which have afflicted Africa, could be attributed to the lack of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such conflicts frustrates efforts towards regional cooperation,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is indeed difficult for any country to carry out any meaningful bilateral cooperation and trade relations with its fellow African states which are involved in a civil wars,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masire also urged African leaders to grab every available opportunity within their reach, to address their nations' problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the key steps towards the solution of any problem is the recognition and acceptance of the fact that problem do indeed exist,&quot; he added. &quot;In this respect, our round table is a crucial step in the search for available solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absence of good government, he said, bred suspicion and cynicism among the governed, with the resulting &quot;erosion of confidence in the national institutions, leading to political instability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told his colleagues that the Southern African Development Community, a 12-nation economic grouping, was taking some necessary measures to promote stability and development after many years of subregional instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political stability and sustainable economic development in our countries need the support of our people, particularly at the grassroots level. Our people must never feel that the development process, be it economic, social or political, is being imposed on them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - An emergency summit of the 18-member O.A.U.  committee on conflict resolution is to meet March 18-19 to discuss the fighting and political instability in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O.A.U. Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said Wednesday that the meeting was in response to the deteriorating security situation in the area, especially eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three venues, Togo, Nigeria and the O.A.U. headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, are being considered as venue for the special summit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit is to be preceded by a Council of Ministers meeting to prepare the agenda for the African leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the committee, known as the O.A.U. Central Organ for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution, are Algeria, Cameroon, Congo, the Comoros, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Malawi, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nigeria, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim told PANA that the secretariat had been encouraged in recommending the summit by the leaders of Nigeria, Togo and Benin, who met recently in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, and jointly expressed their concern about the conflict and the need for an urgent solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier debate by the ministerial session had been dominated by the crisis in that part of Africa, with the Zairean foreign minister, Kamanda wa Kamanda, insisting that Rwanda and Uganda were aiding rebel incursions on its territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his Rwandan counterpart, Anastase Gasana, denied the charge, saying the conflict was an internal Zaire problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Allegations of invasion is diversionary,&quot; he said, adding that Rwanda was only being made a scapegoat by Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Uganda delegation also spoke in the same vein, saying that accusations and counter accusations were no solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conflict in the region, apart from resulting in loss of lives, has created refugees and other humanitarian problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, it has defied regional and international peace initiatives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - Africa's leading political body, the Organization of African Unity (O.A.U) is to support an African First Ladies' Summit for Peace planned for April in Abuja, the Nigerian capital. This was part of decision by the organization's Committee of Ambassadors at the ministerial council session taking place in Tripoli, Libya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision followed Nigeria's offer to host the summit as part of regional peace efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's ambassador to the O.A.U., Brownson Dede, said: &quot;The summit is to give African first ladies a chance to contribute their quota to the quest for peace in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the idea followed the 1995 World Women Conference in Beijing, China, in which the Ghanaian and Nigerian first ladies, Nana Rawlings and Maryam Abacha, played an active part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a lengthy discussion on the need to confine the activities of the first ladies to humanitarian issues, the committee urged the O.A.U. and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa to support the initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar initiative is already in progress at the level of the West African subregion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African first ladies are expected to tour troubled areas on the continent with the aim of mobilizing support for victims of conflicts, who are mainly women and children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - Eleven of the 53 member-countries of the Organization of African Unity have yet to either sign or ratify the treaty establishing the African Economic Community (AEC), almost seven years after it was adopted by African leaders, an official said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O.A.U. Assistant Secretary-General Vijay Makhan told the organization's ongoing 65th ministerial council meeting that such delay and the &quot;lukewarm&quot; attitude of chief executives of regional economic communities posed a threat to continental integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his report to the conference, he said that Eritrea and South Africa were yet to sign or ratify the treaty adopted in Abuja, the Nigerian capital in 1991.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries that have signed but yet to ratify include, Benin, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Swaziland and Togo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates from some of these countries told PANA the delay was in some cases due to &quot;administrative reasons,&quot; rather than a lack of political will or opposition to the treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahkan said most chief executives of regional economic organizations, who were supposed to champion the treaty, never attend O.A.U. meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional economic communities were charged with laying the foundation of the integration expected to take Africa out of underdevelopment and toward the modern age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mahkan told the meeting the O.A.U. secretariat was moving ahead to lay down the structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this end, he said the first ministerial meeting and summit of the O.A.U.  's Economic and Social Commission were held in Yaounde, Cameroon, last year, to try and kick-start the implementation of the protocol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there was need for effective cooperation between the AEC and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. Both bodies plan a summit in Libreville, Gabon, later in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar collaboration is also planned with the Geneva-based World Trade Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their contributions, some delegates called for greater emphasis on social issues in the work of the Economic and Social Commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Laurent-Desire Kabila, leader of the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), held talks with South African President Mandela today according to press reports. Rebel sources have said Kabila will not meet with Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko's officials in South Africa, but insists on one-to-one talks with Mobutu.  President Mobutu, who is in France, says he will not talk to the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Reports of fighting and looting in and around Kindu continue. The Zairean Ministry of Defence has admitted there is fighting around the garrison town, but claim today that government troops had pushed back rebels and reached the strategically important Elila bridge about 50 kilometres east of Kindu. The Ministry of Defence said there had been &quot;violent exchanges&quot; with the rebels at Moyengo, about 40 kilometres south of Kindu, reports AFP. According to one well-informed source in the region, the rebels intend to take Kindu to give Mobutu &quot;an incentive&quot; to negotiate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Kinshasa, the defence ministry reported that Ugandan troops were massed in the northeast of the Upper Zaire region, around Mount-Bleu, Bunia and Mahagi, close to the Ugandan border. It said the Ugandan forces were equiped with tanks, heavy guns and rocket launchers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Kabila's forces &quot;are moving in on Zaire's third largest city, Kisangani, and the Tingi-Tingi refugee camps&quot;, Rwandan state radio reported yesterday.  Kabila, however, has previously given assurances that he will hold back his troops for humanitarian reasons from Tingi-Tingi and Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Seventeen heads of state in the Organisation of African Unity will meet on March 18-19 to discuss the war and refugee crisis in Zaire, OAU officials and foreign ministers said today in Tripoli. OAU spokesman Ibrahim Dagash said that the gathering would involve countries in the Central Organ (for conflict resolution) of the OAU and would probably meet in Lome, Togo (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Abuja, Nigeria are also being considered). Libiyan leader Colonel Kadhafi was expected to open the OAU meeting yesterday but inexplicably failed to turn up. OAU spokesman Ibrahim Dagash said the OAU had been told by the Libiyan government that Kadhafi would come for the closing session on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The French government expressed hope yesterday that peace efforts led by Pretoria &quot;will very soon achieve concrete results&quot;, reports AFP. Foreign spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said there was urgent need to reach a truce and stop the fighting in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Refugees International said in a statement yesterday that while peace talks were a &quot;welcome first step&quot; towards a solution in eastern Zaire, they were &quot;not focused on the dire emergency at hand: the fate of hundreds of thousands of sick and starving displaced Zaireans and Rwandan and Burundian refugees&quot;. It said that reports of high mortality rates in Tingi-Tingi camps, fears of appropriation of food by Rwandan militia, and possible execution of refugees by Rwandan camp leaders, makes the outlook for refugees and the displaced in eastern Zaire &quot;bleak&quot;. The statement also points out that the fate of some 25,000 refugees from Kalima (before, Shabunda) remains unknown.  The refugees were in &quot;very bad condition&quot; before fleeing Kalima. Refugees Interational recommends that: donor governments express their support and provide every means necessary to evacuate vulnerable people from eastern Zaire by air; the government of Zaire permit humanitarian agencies to search by air and on the ground for refugees who fled into the forest; the international community support the UNHCR in every way possible to facilitate the rescue and repatriation of refugees near Kingulube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan accepted the resignations of the chief administrator and deputy prosecutor of the Rwandan genocide court, UN spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt said yesterday. Chief administrator Andronico Adede of Kenya and deputy prosecutor Honore Rakotomanana of Madagascar submitted their resignations after meetings with Annan in New York. According to the spokesman, the Secretary-General concluded that &quot;the continuation of the two officials of the Tribunal in their posts would not be in the interests of the United Nations and the work of the Tribunal&quot;. Annan has appointed Agwu Okali of Nigeria, who works in Nairobi for the UN agency HABITAT, as the new chief administrator, or registrar. Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada was also summoned to New York last Friday for consultations with the Secretary-General. In a report released this month UN Inspector-General Karl Pashcke found unqualified staff, financial waste and mismanagement at all levels of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Cameroon's Court of Appeal freed six Rwandan war crimes suspects Wednesday stating that there was insufficient evidence to extradite them to the International UN Tribunal in Arusha. Officials said that the Court of Appeal had found that the accusations against the men were &quot;not sufficiently grave&quot; and that the evidence presented was &quot;insufficient&quot;. The UN Tribunal had provided last minute evidence against two of the men, which had prolonged their stay in custody. The six men are among 13 people the Cameroon authorities arrested in 1996 in response to requests from the Rwandan government which had named them as taking part in the 1994 genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Most of the exiled Rwandans arrested by Kenyan police in a &quot;swoop&quot; this week have been freed, reports AFP. Among those picked up and held were former Rwanda prime minister Jean Kambanda, who held office April-July 1994. High profile Rwandan exiles campaigned this week on behalf of certain groups of Rwandans, releasing a statement claiming the swoop was aimed at &quot;Hutus&quot; - the swoop, however, targetted all Rwandans. Sources quoted in the press suggested the swoop could be linked to the recent arrival several hundred Hutu ex-FAR and other Rwandans from Tingi-Tingi camps in eastern Zaire. Police swoops against refugees and immigrants are commonplace in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Burundi radio reported on Wednesday that security forces carried out a search at Gisenyi displaced persons camp. The security sweep follows an attack in Kamenge, northern Bujumbura, on Monday night, which targetted a district secretary. Seven people, including his wife, were killed and an infant stabbed. A military source said that the search was carried out on the basis of intelligence provided by one of the assailants arrested on the night of the attack, and 18 more people have been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* At the opening of a two-day conference in Kampala on &quot;the challenge of peace in northern Uganda&quot;, President Yoweri Museveni sent assurances that the government is willing to facilitate any genuine initiative to bring peace and an end to conflict. His remarks were relayed through a speech reacd for him by the prime minister, Kintu Musoke. In the speech, the president warned those &quot;who seek assistance from Sudan to stop it for the well-being of their people and economic growth in northern Uganda&quot;, reports Ugandan state radio.  On the same day, Ugandan radio broadcast an appeal from the Resident District Commission (RDC) from Kabarole district, Western Uganda, Dan Mugisha Mwesigye.  Mwesigye appealed to rebels in southwestern Uganda to voluntarily surrender and &quot;join the rest of the Ugandans in developing the country&quot;. The RDC said that no rebel would be punished if he surrendered. He also said that not all the rebels who attacked Kasese were Tabliqs - Ugandan Muslim Fundamentalists - and that the government was of &quot;all people, including Moslems&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Uganda has halted civilian flights to the northern town of Gulu. Civilian air operators said the ban had been in effect since Tuesday, reports AFP.  Major General Salim Saleh, special presidential advisor to the north, said the government feared Sudan would bomb the north. Gulu is the heart of an insurgency by Christian fundamentalist rebels. The Ugandan government accused Sudan of bombing the nrothern town of Moyo on February 13; Sudan denied it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Pan-African Conference on Peace, Gender and Development begins on Saturday in Kigali, Rwanda. The conference is organised under the auspices of the OAU, ECA, various UN agencies and the Netherlands government. The conference was conceived by the coalition of Rwandan women, the Government and civil society represented by Pro-Femmes/Twese Hamwe, the National Advisory Board on Women and the Ministry of Family and Promotion of Women.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A R30-million, commuter-friendly shopping centre is to be built on two hectares in the heart of Bellville's business district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shoprite Checkers has won the contract for the development of the 15 000 sq m retail development. The site, which belongs to Transnet, is below Voortrekker Road and is bounded by Tienie Meyer Drive and Modderdam and Belrail roads.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre will be called Commuter City and is due for completion next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site, previously used as a parcel receiving and dispatching depot by Transnet, adjoins the Bellville station, the main Tygerberg regional bus depot and the largest taxi depot in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip van der Merwe, deputy managing director for Shoprite Checkers Properties, said a feature of the design would be easy links for pedestrians between different forms of transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big tenants would be positioned along a pedestrian street and around a centre court - all of which would be linked to the bus terminus, the taxi terminus and Bellville station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There would be a shopping area on the edges, facing on to the parking area and the bus and taxi termini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food, fashion and service-type shops would be grouped together, Mr Van der Merwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small traders would be housed in spaza-type shops fronting on to the bus terminus from both sides, where they could display their wares in open units featuring retractable roller shutters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Van der Merwe said Commuter City was the result of co-operation between Transnet, the local authority, the commuting public and the property industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Other national anchor retailers have expressed interest in taking up retail space,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sipho Mashinini, senior manager at Propnet, said developers had been invited to incorporate Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) principles in the project through the empowerment of professional practices, smaller contractors, formal and informal entrepreneurs and taxi operators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community would be consulted in the early planning stages of the development, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andre Malan, of the Bellville town planning department, said: &quot;We hope that the provision of additional facilities at the commuter ranks will contribute to peace and business entrepreneurship in the area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The development is based on a 50-year lease and is expected to be completed during 1998.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Urban farming may seem to be a contradiction in terms - but herds of cattle and goats grazing on the verges of the N2 highway or using a pedestrian bridge to cross to the other side have become familiar sights in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although effectively landless, a handful of people originally from the Eastern Cape are keeping cattle, sheep and goats in the townships of Langa, Nyanga and Guguletu to augment their meagre wages. Others who have lost their jobs are looking at farming as the alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although their stock is often stolen and impounded for straying across roads, they are determined to continue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say keeping livestock is important among Xhosa-speaking people because animals are used to cure sick children and for boys undergoing circumcision.  Xhosa customs include the slaughtering of a goat before boys are sent to initiation school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Xhosa tradition, when a child is born the imbeleko is performed to introduce a child to the ancestors so he grows up in good health.  A goat is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the ancestors appear in one's dreams asking to quench their thirst, the interpretation is that the person in whose dreams they appear should make umqomboti - Xhosa beer - and inform people in the community when it is ready to be drunk. In some cases people take sifted dry cow dung and spread it beneath the umqomboti container while waiting for the beer to ferment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some urban farmers say they breed livestock because they grew up in homes where their parents were farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stololo Mvandaba from Cofimvaba in the former Transkei said he grew up in a family of farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 54-year-old farmer, who did not go beyond lower primary schooling, came to the Mother City in 1961 to look for a job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He worked as a labourer in various construction companies until 1990, when he bought a second-hand taxi. The taxi was written off in an accident in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same year he bought two baby goats. Since then he has stayed at home and looked after the goats, building a kraal for them next to his shack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mvandaba bought six more goats and the first two produced kids. Later he sold three goats and bought two calves and sheep. Today Mr Mvandaba has 60 goats, 30 sheep and six head of cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is the chairman of the newly-launched Sibanye Small Farmers' Association for township farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mvandaba said his interest in livestock stemmed from the fact that he grew up in a home that was rich in cattle and sheep. &quot;It was the only line I thought I should follow because I left school early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the community no longer struggled to get livestock when they wanted to perform customary rites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who are preparing to send their boys to the initiation school come to me to buy goats. Even those who want to perform imbeleko buy goats from me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to tradition, when a young baby loses weight, the parents remove the end of a cow's tail, mix it with cow dung and tie it around the child's neck,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goats cost between R200 and R400 each depending on size, while the cattle sell for between R1 500 and R2 000 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of problems he faced, including stock theft and traffic officers impounding animals, he said firmly: &quot;Farming is my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another farmer from Langa township who has been breeding cattle for the past four years is Johnson Ndude from Engcobo in the former Transkei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He works as a security guard in Langa. Being the sole breadwinner at home, he felt his monthly salary of less than R1 000 was not enough to provide for his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he came to Langa four years ago he found that some men were breeding cattle. He was interested and joined them. Now he has more than 10 head of cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He keeps his livestock in a large kraal behind the Langa migrant labour hostels. Like Mr Mvandaba, Mr Ndude grew up in a farming home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His thoughts about home brought back fond memories of livestock he left there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I breed cattle for money and for the love of them,&quot; he said. &quot;I go home once a year and I felt I should breed cattle here, so that I could remain in touch with what I love most.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The passing of the Telecommunications Act in November 1996 was a milestone in a process which was embarked on by government soon after its inception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government's vision, embodied in the policy framework which gave rise to the Act, is to ensure vigorous growth in the telecommunications market through the extensive roll-out of a modern network, providing universal access in South Africa, especially to previously disadvantaged areas, and at the same time preparing to meet the challenges of competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How was this best to be achieved? Especially as the South African marketplace was characterised by a high teledensity (number of lines per 100 people) in affluent urban areas, making this sector extremely attractive to potential competitors, and extremely low teledensity in less affluent urban and rural areas, which only had longer-term potential for growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further factor was the challenge of restructuring Telkom, the largest telecommunications enterprise in Africa, into an organisation capable of delivering a speedy roll-out with the necessary technology, in such a manner that it would still be able to hold its own in a highly-competitive marketplace when liberalisation occurred.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The route chosen, in common with a number of other developing economies around the world, was that of finding a strategic equity partner (SEP). The Act, which was the culmination of a long process of consultation including Green and White Papers, permitted the government, through the Ministry for Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting, to proceed with the sale of up to 30 percent of Telkom to one or a possible consortium of international telecommunications operators. The Government also intends to make a further 10 percent equity stake in Telkom available to previously disadvantaged communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Requests for proposals have been issued and four companies - Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, Southwestern Bell Corporation (SBC) and Telekom Malaysia - are expected to bid, either singly or in consortia, in the final round. The bids will be evaluated by the Ministry's advisors, and a recommendation made to the Minister. The process is expected to be completed in April. There are no preferred bidders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A strong regulatory framework, modelled on international best practice, was a cornerstone of the new Act. The Act meets the policy objectives of the promotion of universal and affordable telecommunication services, which are responsive to the needs of consumers, and the promotion of fair competition within the telecommunications industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The framework was thus intended to smooth the transition from a market currently dominated (but not monopolised) by Telkom, to one in which there is robust competition amongst a variety of telecommunication service providers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provisions of the Act, which envisages a three-tiered structure, are already well on the way to being implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (SATRA) has been established, chaired by Nape Maepa, as well as the Universal Service Agency (USA), chaired by Mlungisi Hlongwane. Draft Telkom licenses have been issued by the Ministry and are expected to be finalised shortly. Other Telkom licenses will be issued by SATRA, which has been given wide powers by the Act and is one of the most independent regulatory bodies in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policy directions relating to the Human Resources Fund, a fund to promote the provision of adequately skilled human resources at all levels of the telecommunications sector, and the Universal Service Fund, which will assist in providing telecommunications to needy people and communities which have no access at present, have also been issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry will continue to provide policy direction and oversee its shareholding in Telkom. The Ministry is also directly responsible for administering the Human Resource Fund, and overseeing the activities of the USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the second tier, SATRA will be responsible for monitoring Telkom's compliance with the Act, essentially acting as a watchdog for the industry.  After an initial three-year period, during which Telkom may not increase its overall basket of tariffs by more than inflation minus 1,5 percent, SATRA will be responsible for setting tariff structures. SATRA also sets interconnect guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an independent regulator, SATRA must balance the interests of consumers on the one hand and stakeholders in Telkom and market participants, on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the third tier, Telkom, together with whichever SEP wins the bid, is responsible for telecommunication operations, including an aggressive roll- out of services which has only been equalled in a few countries in the world, and the upgrading of existing services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft licenses, which were published by the Ministry at the beginning of February, inter alia provide SATRA with the mechanism to monitor Telkom, and will bring about far-reaching changes in the telecommunications environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three licenses are for: Public Switched Telecommunications Services (PSTS); The transmission of radio frequencies; and Value Added Network Services (VANS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are for a 25-year period, with Telkom being permitted to provide local and long distance telecommunication services, international and pay phone services on an exclusive basis for five years, during which it has to meet stringent roll-out and service quality targets. Failure to achieve these targets will result in the payment of monetary penalties by Telkom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roll-out targets include targets in respect of the total number of new exchange lines, new public pay phones, new lines for priority customers such as hospitals, schools, libraries, local authorities and post offices, new lines for villages, and replacement lines. Service quality targets will substantially increase Telkom's accountability to customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government welcomes informed debate about the restructuring process.  Extensive consultation surrounded the drafting of the Green and White Papers, the election of SATRA members was conducted in an open and transparent manner, and public hearings have been held around the draft license. It is unfortunate, however, that some debate has been ill-informed and indicates a lack of understanding of the newly-created regulatory framework and its relation to international precedent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to certain allegations, competition already exists in the South African telecommunications industry. Not only do the two cellular operators, MTN and Vodacom, compete with each other, but they also compete with Telkom in that they provide many of the same services. Competition among these operators will be enhanced by a more liberal interconnection regime, to be introduced under the Act, whereby the cellular operators will be able to secure access on more favourable terms. In addition to the cellular operators and their service providers, there are more than 50 paging companies in South Africa. A new cellular service provider is expected to be licensed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Full competition among providers of customer premises equipment, including telephones themselves, has been introduced. Providers of Value-added Network Services, including the provision of a broad range of services via the Internet, are also subject to full competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five-year exclusivity period is shorter than is common in other countries where the basic infrastructure is underdeveloped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This phased approach to liberalisation allows the telecommunications operators to meet their universal service obligations before the introduction of full competition, regarded as essential if the country as a whole is to gain the full economic benefits of being part of the global telecommunications market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another issue which has been contended is that of price. Telkom late last year introduced a new tariff strategy which, among other things, kept the overall basket of increases at seven percent - two percent below the expected rate of inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An element of the strategy is the rebalancing of tariffs - another step in preparing Telkom for competition. Historically, Telkom has heavily subsidised its local call tariffs by charging higher rates for its long distance and international calls. Rebalancing involves local calls becoming more cost- related, with a significant decrease in the price of long-distance and international calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to make the service more affordable, installation charges were cut in December by more than 40 percent, while pay phone tariffs remained unchanged. Special concessions were also made for pensioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is inappropriate, therefore to accuse Telkom of high prices. In addition competition will inevitably lead to lower prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we approach the millennium, it is the Government's responsibility to ensure that firm foundations have been laid for the country's entry into the information society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everything in its power has been done to ensure that this commitment is fulfilled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus and two other leading national business figures have joined the Olympic bid team to spearhead a private sector fundraising drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Marcus is joined on the bid executive by Ian Goldin, chief executive of the Development Bank of South Africa, and Khaya Ngqula, chief executive of the Industrial Development Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move comes as Cape Town, confident of a place in next week's shortlist selection, gears up to lobby support internationally in the crucial six months to the final vote on September 5.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past few days, two private sector sponsors have pledged R1-million to the bid and the Cape Metropolitan Council has contributed R2,5-million.  The City of Cape Town is also to consider a similar investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These sums, which follow the overwhelmingly positive technical assessment by the International Olympic Committee's evaluation commission, are intended to give the bid a competitive edge in the race against leading rivals Rome, Athens, Stockholm and Buenos Aires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The funds are to be used to pay for preparations for the presentation to the IOC in Lausanne next week and in September, and travelling and accommodation costs, as well as the costs of visits by IOC members in the next six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ideally, the bid needs R20-million to make the most of this phase of the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bidding has already attracted more than R300-million in government infrastructure investment in the Western Cape and has provided unprecedented exposure to the city internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this background, CMC exco chairman Pierre Uys argued that private and public institutions had every reason to invest in the bid to give every chance of succeeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are sending out the message that it's time for people to put their money where their mouth is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have passed the technical test with flying colours - now we must keep the bid going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hoped the City of Cape Town &quot;will come up with their share&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Party councillor Brian Watkyns said though he was &quot;fully behind the bid&quot;, the cash injection was inadvisable before the shortlist selection and without having sight of the bid's financial records.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Cape Town child-protection agencies have hit out at &quot;grossly irresponsible&quot; British authorities for deporting self-confessed paedophile Dennis Hundermark to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundermark has been described as a &quot;human timebomb&quot;, allegedly with an uncontrollable urge to rape young children and even babies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was set free in Cape Town at the weekend after serving only three months of a 16-month sentence in Britain for a sex-related offence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundermark, who has a South African passport and dual SA-Zimbabwean citizenship, was brought to Cape Town under guard by three Scotland Yard detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British police mistakenly assumed he would be arrested here, but he was freed in the city when local police found no South African charges against him were pending. His present whereabouts are unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child protection groups accused the British authorities of granting Hundermark early parole simply to foist an unwanted criminal on South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups demanded police investigate him as a threat to society because of his alleged confession in a British court that he was unable to control his overwhelming desire to rape young children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundermark is reported to have admitted in court that it was only a matter of time before he struck again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His whereabouts should be monitored and communities in which he was living informed of the alleged danger, child-protection organisations said. Cape Town police had followed the letter of the law in not arresting him, but this showed inadequacies in the law and the need to re-examine the constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rape Crisis legal adviser Bronwyn Pithey said South Africa needed an arrangement with other countries stipulating that people deported here after being convicted of crimes should serve the rest of their sentences here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why do we have to wait for something more to happen? If the police Child Protection Unit is not investigating him, a question mark hangs over their heads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caron Erasmus, Childline counselling manager, said Hundermark should be in therapy and under no circumstances allowed to work with children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She labelled his early release and parole as &quot;bizarre&quot; and queried the law for not locking up self-confessed child abusers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Jackson, director of the Child Welfare Society in Cape Town, asked if the British authorities had established the legal position in South Africa before deporting Hundermark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Justice should urgently reconsider legislation to avoid a repetition of this situation, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police should be informed constantly of Hundermark's whereabouts. &quot;If he is allowed to operate here without people knowing his history, we have a serious problems on our hands,&quot; Mr Jackson said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - there is an imperative need for negotiations on the redistribution of the Nile waters as their utilization at present is &quot;grossly unjust&quot; and ignores the legitimate rights and interest of most riparian states, an Ethiopian legal expert noted Tuesday during the ongoing 5th Nile 2002 Conference on legal and constitutional framework for cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Girma Amare, head of the Legal Affairs General Directorate in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that there was an urgent need for negotiations on the equitable utilization of the Nile to avert potential crisis arising from separate actions by riparian states. &quot;The status quo should not be allowed to continue as it does not promote cooperation among the Nile basin countries for optimal utilization of their untapped resources,&quot; he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Amare pointed out that there is, on the one hand, a &quot;purposeful and determined effort&quot; by Egypt &quot;to use and consume every drop of the Nile &quot;even to the extent of diverting it beyond its natural drainage basin while, on the other, other riparian states are sooner or later bound to assert their right to engage in the actual utlization of their waters using standards which they deem legitimate and appropriate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ato Amare, such trend would give rise to competitive and conflicting uses of the water resource. He indicated that if this state of affairs is left unattended to, the situation could &quot;degenerate into crisis and not augur well for beneficial cooperative relationship among the Nile basin States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expert was of the view that one strategy for upstream-down-stream cooperation in the utilization of the Nile, as suggested by hydraulic experts, is the construction of a number of reservoirs on the upper reaches of the flow to control its variation. &quot;Impounding the Blue Nile at Lake Tana in Ethiopia could prevent the loss of as much as 15 billion cubic meters per year of the much needed water, almost a fifth of the Nile's annual flow, by evaporation and seepage from the downstream lake Nassar, created by Aswan High Dam&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, however, that such an arrangement, whatever its significance it is unwilling to lose her &quot;monopoly&quot; over the flow of the Nile.  &quot;There is an over-exaggerated sensitivity that if a dam is built on the highlands of Ethiopia to harness the waters of the Nile it will be exposed to Egyptian vulnerability&quot;. he pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expert emphasised that Ethiopia should not be expected to postpone indefinitely the use of its water resources for its abundant water resources of the Nile for its development needs, to ensure food security for its growing population and avert the dangers of drought which it had painfully experience,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the basis of its share of the area of the Nile's drainage basin and its huge water contribution, Ato Amare noted, Ethiopia should be entitled to a large portion of the Nile's waters. he pointed out that it is presently using less than I billion cubic meters while contributing 72 billion cubic metre of water on average, amounting to 86 per cent of the Nile water. Ethiopia has for a long time been relegated to a position of merely asserting its claims against down-stream states, while making no effective utilization,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Amare suggested, however, that countries of the Nile should engage themselves in fruitful negotiations to allocate equitable share of the Nile waters. &quot;There is no reason why countries of the Nile basin do not accept and negotiate their shared resources on the basis of the universally accepted principle of equitable utlization of transboundary waters,&quot; the expert stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the course of the deliberation, Ato Amare gave clarifications on various points raised by participants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AWASSA - The Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Regional State (SNNPRS) expects to reap 17.67 million quintals of agricultural products during this harvest season - representing a 31.3 per cent growth over that of last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Submitting the latest six-monthly report to the 4th regular conference of the regional state which was opened here yesterday, SNNPRS President Abate Kisho said that the expected harvest was to be collected from 4,504 half- hectare extension package demonstration sites and 1.44 million hectares of land tilled in the traditional way. Ato Abate attributed the success to the newly adopted extension package scheme and described it as a positive sign of the regional state's irreversible drive towards attainment of self- sufficiency in food.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ato Abate, peasant farmers embraced in the package reaped an average of 55,31, and 12 quintals per hectare of maize, wheat and &quot;teff&quot;, respectively. He nonetheless singled out delayed debt repayment by farmers as the main obstacle to the implementation of the overall agricultural extension package, to which he called for a quick solution. He said that over 16 million birr was still in arrears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the next crop season the extension package has been so designed as to include oil seeds, pulses, spices, fruits and vegetables as well as poultry among others it was learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report disclosed that the regional investment bureau has since 1984 EC, issued a number of entrepreneurs with licences for 242 projects with a total capital outlay of 1.03 billion birr. Many of the licensed projects cover agriculture, agro-industries, construction, trade and real estate as well as hotels and tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of the projects are reportedly still in the formative stage and that when they begin operation the are expected to generate employment for some 39,800 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Abate reminded participants of the November 1996 Investment Promotion Workshop, which this regional capital hosted, had served its intended purpose.  According to him, following the convening of said workshop, 90 investors applied for new licences of whom 37, with a total capital outlay of 102.7 million birr, have already been granted the necessary documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regional president revealed that some people in the Agriculture, Works and Urban Development as well as Water, Mines and Energy Resources Development Bureaux have been suspected of embezzling public fund and properties and that their cases have reached the courts. He said that the police have been investigating more such cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Abate's report covered a wide range of issues in the economic, political and social sectors. The afternoon session was devoted to discussing the economic aspects of the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference will continue discussion the political part of the report, on justice and security in particular, it also deliberates on two draft proclamations for the establishments of judicial, administrative council and rural road fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's opening session was attended by some senior Federal government officials who represent the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The trick by thieves using poisoned meat to kill guard dogs is well known. But two men who tried this Tuesday in Kasama, northern Zambia, found the bait is not foolproof.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On that fateful night, the district police said, a man offered poisoned meat to four &quot;vicious&quot; canines, so that he and a fellow thief could later steal pigeons from a barn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, for the thieves, only one of the ferocious dogs took the bait and died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some unexplained reason, the other three dogs just sniffed at the meat and went back to sleep, police told reporters Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thinking that they had successfully accomplished their mission of killing the dogs, the two men later returned to the house and climbed the barn and started stealing the pigeons,&quot; northern regional Police Deputy Commander Crispas Siame was quoted Thursday as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thieves managed to rustle 44 pigeons from the barn and were happily climbing down, having let &quot;the sleeping dogs lie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As fate would have it, one of the thieves stepped on a weak piece of wood and fell. The noise woke the three sleeping dogs. Then, they set upon the man.  One of the thieves escaped with the birds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another had his ears, mouth and other parts torn off by the dogs which left him an unrecognizable corpse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kasama District Police said are trying to identify the deceased and his runaway colleague -- and possibly to recover the pigeons</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - After a lapse of two years, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), summit will be held April 10 in Lusaka, Zambia's information and broadcasting deputy minister, Ernest Mwansa, said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening a two-day Comesa workshop for journalists, he said the summit will be held April 10.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement, at the opening of a two-day Comesa workshop for journalists, comes against doubts about the future of the regional integration organisation after Mozambique and Lesotho gave notice of their attention to leave in favour of the 12-member Southern African Development Community, or Sadc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both countries said their immediate interested lay with Sadc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;WE should concentrate on Sadc, rather than joining an institution with a lot of members and where there is conflict between the members,&quot; Mozambican Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao said in December, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said even when Comesa was created, Maputo had some reservations, &quot; because our volume of cooperation with many countries in the organisation was negligible. We just signed adhesion to the Comesa treaty but we have never ratified it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadc consists of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comesa comprises Angola, Burundi, Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Egypt has officially stated its intention to maximize utilization of the Nile river's water to meet the requirements of its rapidly growing population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Egyptian water authorities said they were dissatisfaction with the current supply, saying it is insufficient to meet its domestic demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt said this in a position paper presented to the fifth Nile 2002 Conference which entered its fourth day Thursday in the Ethiopian capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the other upstream Nile riparian states consider Egypt and Sudan to be taking the lion's share of Africa's largest and longest river, under the 1959 treaty, Egyptian water authorities say their country needs more water to improve food security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nile river riparian countries are Burundi, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To drum up support for its case, Egypt has adopted a gradual &quot;confidence building&quot; approach to the development of the Nile through cooperation on regional and subregional bases among the countries in the river basin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Egyptian stand is in contrast to the demand of some riparian states such as Ethiopia &quot;for an equitable share&quot; of Nile waters in the not to distant future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Projects beneficial for the Nile river basin countries, without any appreciable harm to each other, could be the first step for regional cooperation and confidence-building measures,&quot; Egypt says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present, Egypt cultivates 7.8 million acres (3.2 million hectares) of irrigated land and wants more water for an additional 1.6 million acres (647, 520 hectares) of reclaimed land by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Horizontal expansion and land reclamation for agriculture is a must due to the fact that the area of cultivated land per capita is decreasing rapidly because of rapid population growth,&quot; the Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a population of 62 million, Egypt's ratio of cultivated land is about 0.12 acre (0.05 hectares) per person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt also wants the establishment of a Nile basin regional data bank that would be linked with national data banks of the various riparian states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This way, it hopes the riparian states would be able to reach &quot;an overall integrated plan&quot; for development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it says that this requires &quot;a lot of effort and financial resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ongoing meeting on the sharing of the Nile water is a follow-up to four previous ones, which were held in Egypt, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya will host the 1998 conference while the 1999 meeting is scheduled to be held in Zaire, to discuss the water-sharing procedure on the 6,500- kilometer long river Nile.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - Libyan leader Moammar Kadhafi has urged African countries to shun the creation of a continental peace force as proposed by the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;African countries have their own armies and police that can solve African conflicts,&quot; he said at a dinner he hosted Wednesday in Tripoli for delegates attending the 65th ministerial council meeting of the Organization of African Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must set up our own force to prevent any foreign intervention in African affairs,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadhafi said that any African force acting under orders of any foreign power would be rejected by all of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called also for member states of the organization to establish a special fund to finance an African controlled force, while not rejecting the idea of foreign contributions to the fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can accept financial contributions from the United States, France or any other country on condition that such contributions are not linked to obligations or preconditions,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was reacting to a proposal made in 1996 by former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher during an African tour to canvass support for the controversial proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several states, including South Africa, had expressed reservations over the idea, saying it should be an African rather than a foreign-controlled force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadhafi, who survived a 1986 U.S. Air Force raid on his Tripoli residence, said Africans were capable of mobilizing and funding their peace force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America should remain in its territory,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadhafi also used the occasion to address Africa's many problems, blaming most of them on the &quot;colonialists,&quot; whom he accused of fuelling conflicts that serve their objective of perpetual subjugation of Africa and its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He condemned the U.S.-sponsored United Nations sanctions against Libya, saying this amounted to passing judgement without a trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Libyan leader described as a &quot;challenge of African unity and solidarity, &quot; Tripoli's hosting of the Organization of African Unity's Council of Foreign Ministers meeting, despite of the sanctions imposed on Libya in 1992 over allegations that his country was involved in the 1988 bombing of a PanAm jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. Some 270 people were killed in the plane and on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadhafi reiterated that the suspects arrested by Libya in connection with the case could be tried in a neutral country but not in the United States or Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He praised delegates to the council meeting for &quot;defying the American sanctions,&quot; by finding their way to Tripoli from Tunisia by road, a distance of some 300 kilometers (186.42 miles).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the first major meeting, bringing together at least 30 African foreign ministers, in Tripoli since the imposition of the U.N. sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya unsuccessfully tried to host an O.A.U. summit in 1982.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KASANE, Botswana (PANA) - Leaders from 18 African countries, who met in Botswana for a two-day commonwealth round-table summit which ended Thursday, have affirmed the importance of civic education as a key element in the promotion and protection of democracy, amid concern that democratic principles were crumbling on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders, who met in the northern Botswana resort town of Kasane, said it was important to provide educational campaigns which emphasized the rights and obligations of all: government, opposition parties and civil society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, they expressed concern about the role of some non-governmental organizations which, with foreign support, promoted activities harmful to stable democratic processes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a communique released at the end of the summit, the leaders underlined that &quot;sustainable democracy could only grow within societies and could neither be prescribed nor imposed from outside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In expressing this belief, they referred to the experience of de- colonization of Africa and their own national struggles for political freedom which had been inspired by the desire to win democratic rights for their peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The round table summit was organized by the Commonwealth secretariat in London, Britain. It was used by the leaders to review progress in democratization in their respective countries since the adoption of the Harare Commonwealth declaration of 1991 and to exchange views on how they might meet present and future challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders received the report of the preparatory meeting of the two-day round table held Monday. They welcomed the fact that it was the product of a cross-section of representatives of governing and opposition parties from their respective countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit was attended by the presidents and prime ministers of Botswana, Cameroon, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the principles contained in the Harare Declaration. This document included the protection and promotion of democracy, democratic processes and institutions which reflect national circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, the leaders called for the universally-accepted ingredients of democracy, which included the right of people to elect freely their government, the primacy of the rule of law and independence of the judiciary, the right of freedom of expression and association and the transparency and accountability of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Harare Declaration, Africa had made considerable progress in democratic restructuring. As a result, all the member countries, but for Nigeria, have now jettisoned military or one-party rule. However, Nigeria is engaged in a process to return to civilian rule by 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, challenges and impediments in the way of consolidating democracy remain with poverty, underdevelopment, ethnicity and the weakness of supporting institutions essential to sustainable democracy being the major impediments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders agreed that measures to remove these obstacles called for national effort by all political leaders to cultivate a culture of tolerance, mutual respect and cooperation to promote national peace and stability.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Alex Boraine and I met Mr F W de Klerk, leader of the National Party, for just over an hour at the offices of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Cape Town today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr de Klerk asked me for the meeting after controversy over the Steyn Report, and I insisted that Dr Boraine should be present.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr de Klerk raised the issue of the Steyn Report only briefly before moving onto other issues, and I made clear to him that there is no difference in attitude between Dr Boraine and myself on the key issues facing the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was dominated by issues raised by Mr de Klerk, including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* What he described as the perception that the Commission is not even- handed;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* His concern that we are not placing enough emphasis on reconciliation; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* His conviction that only a handful of members of the Security forces during the apartheid era was guilty of gross violations of human rights (he said in the same way, this was probably true also for the liberation movements).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Boraine and I reassured Mr de Klerk that the Commission was totally committed to even-handedness and gave him a range of examples demonstrating this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also sought to reassure him that reconciliation was our ultimate goal, although the Commission could play only a small part in the long-term task of bringing it about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr de Klerk also dealt with the logistics of his party's reply to the extensive list of questions which he was sent after he made an initial presentation to the Commission last August. He said he expected to deliver the reply in two weeks' time, after which a date for a public hearing would be arranged between us.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome - The World Food Programme today approved a new relief food operation for northern Uganda where insurgency by rebel forces has caused an increasing number of people to flee their homes. Some 220,000 people in the Gulu and Kitgum districts have been uprooted and are consequently impoverished, many of them during the last three months when rebel attacks spread heavily into the Kitgum area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people in northern Uganda are really suffering, and the situation can only get worse if insecurity continues,&quot; said WFP's Executive Director, Catherine Bertini while visiting Kitgum town today. &quot;Most of the people are farmers who are too terrified to return to their land to plant their crops.  If they don't plant, there will be no July harvest -- and if there's no July harvest, the people will need relief food until this time next year.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the beginning of the year, insurgency into Kitgum district intensified.  Once used as a route by rebels to transit to Gulu, Kitgum itself suddenly became the site of attacks in January when a large force attacked several villages and indiscriminately killed more than 300 people. This led to the sudden displacement of 62,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new WFP food operation, worth US$6.7 million including transport costs, will assist 110,000 of the most vulnerable people in northern Uganda. To the extent possible, WFP will distribute the food through food-for-work projects which will help people grow their own food. Other food rations will be distributed through four non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who have been working in the area for many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since July 1996, attacks on civilians by the &quot;Lord's Resistance Army&quot; (LRA) and the &quot;West Nile Bank Front&quot; have increased, with more coordinated and frequent attempts to abduct and convert the local population. Several thousand people have lost their lives or have been subjected to torture and mutiliation upon refusing to join the rebels or to provide them refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These attacks have cause the local population to flee their villages. Their homes, food stocks and standing crops are usually torched, their personal property looted, and their livestock stolen or slaughtered. Most people fled their villages penniless and without possessions, arriving in townships and displaced sites with fragile economies and limited economic opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This rapid influx of internally displaced people to these sites has led to overcrowding, and a complete collapse of water and sanitation systems followed by outbreaks of measles, dysentary and other diseases. Malnutrition, once only a limited and seasonal phenomena in these districts, has become perennial and chronic. Insecurity caused health workers and teachers to flee the rebel-hit areas long ago, leaving only nine out of 45 health clinics operating, and a mere 32 of the total 180 schools operational in the Gulu district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;WFP has already given several batches of emergency food to northern Uganda in order to stop malnutrition from spreading, particularly amongst young children and women,&quot; said Bertini. &quot;But to combat the mounting problems cause by more people being displaced, WFP must now help out on a much larger scale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Uganda has also been providing food and non food items to outlying areas of Gulu district since July 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The depopulation of villages has separated farmers from their land and agricultural livelihood. It has disrupted production and marketing over vast areas, covering one-quarter of the country's cultivable land mass. Insecurity has prevented most farmers from harvesting last season's crop. The few who managed to do so were unable to sell their limited surpluses due to a breakdown in the transport system. Lack of fuel and increased risk to transporters because of landmines and ambushes have made truckers refuse to operate in the area, or only at a high price. High transport costs have in turn, forced the price of cereals to soar beyond the means of the average consumer, particularly of the displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 220,000 persons have been affected by the conflict, including 80, 000 who move to the relative safety of trading centres and military outposts in the evenings, returning to their land to farm during daylight hours.  Another 20,000 are residing with friends and relatives in more secure areas of the country. The remaining 120,000 people have been totally displaced from their land and sources of income, and are crowded within churches, schools, hospital grounds and other sanctuaries. Women, children and the elderly, plus those hospitalized for illness and injuries, are amongst the most vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP's food assistance to 110,000 people in northern Uganda will extend until July 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP is also feeding 260,000 refugees, mostly southern Sudanese, in five camps spread through northern Uganda. Rebel insurgency has made the delivery of food to this population increasing difficult. Refugee camps have themselves been targetted several times by rebels active in the area, resulting in the death of more than 200 refugees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - An unconfirmed number of refugees are reported to be moving out of Tingi-Tingi camps, eastern Zaire, by foot, in fear of an imminent attack.  Rwandan camp leaders in Tingi-Tingi camps today said that all expatriate workers should evacuate from the camps as an attack was expected tonight. The French NGO Action Contre la Faim decided today to evacuate from Tingi-Tingi camps and Kisangani, because of tension and insecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Humanitarian sources describe Kisangani as &quot;tense&quot; - because the behaviour of the Zairean soldiers is unpredictable in the changing situation.  There are unconfirmed reports that the Zairean army has sent in reinforcements to Tingi-Tingi camps, including mercenaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Well-placed regional sources confirm that Kindu has been occupied by rebel forces of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo- Zaire (ADFL) since yesterday monring. The airstrip has also reportedly been taken by the rebels. 2,000 FAZ troops stationed in Kindu garrison town reportedly fled after extensive looting. Fleeing FAZ are reported to be moving westwards towards Katako-Kombe, and are expected to arrive sometime this weekend. Local Zairean press described Kindu today as a &quot;ville morte&quot;.  The World Health Organisation is trying to evacuate a 15-person medical survey team which had been despatched this week to Katako-Kombe. The team had gone to investigate a Monkey Pox outbreak.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomatic sources say that the capture of Kindu and its airport represents a significant strategic gain for the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Sources in the region say that the rebels have made significant gains between Isiro and Kisangani, and the towns of Bafwangbe and Bafwabogbo were confirmed to have been taken by the ADFL. ADFL are reported to have reached Bafwaboli - about 100 kilometres east of Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The approach road to Tingi-Tingi is said to be controlled by Rwandan militia, and the presence of Rwandan soldiers injured in combat in local hospitals point to continued fighting between Rwandan militia and the rebels.  Humanitarian sources say the front line has moved closer to the camp, and is believed to be defended by Rwandan milita. Rwandans and aid workers in Tingi- Tingi camps reported over the last few days that &quot;the sound of battle&quot; can be heard at night. Journalists have reported barrack-like housing exclusively for men on one side of Tingi-Tingi 1. News-agencies have reported that some ex-FAR and former professionals have flown out of Tingi-Tingi, but that the exodus has been predominantly women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Private air companies continue to fly out Rwandans capable of paying $800 or more, to Nairobi via Kisangani, but there is no evidence that the &quot;elite exodus&quot; has reduced the hold of camp leaders on genuine refugees - well- placed sources indicate that, on the contrary, it is the camp leaders who control and administer the exodus. The presence of Rwandan soldiers injured in combat in local hospitals points to continued fighting between Rwandan militia and the rebels. The approach road to Tingi-Tingi is said to be controlled by Rwandan militia; journalists have reported barrack-like housing exclusively for men on one side of Tingi-Tingi I. News agencies have reported that some ex-FAR and former professionals have flown out of Tingi-Tingi, but that the exodus has been predominantly women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Foreign Minister of Zaire, Gerard Kamanda Wa Kamanda on Thursday ruled out any ceasefire with the ADFL as long as &quot;foreign troops&quot; remained in eastern Zaire. At the ministerial meeting of the OAU in Tripoli, Kamanda repeated accusations that Uganda and Rwanda had sent troops to assist the rebels. He said that if &quot;foreign troops&quot; were pulled out in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1097 &quot;we can discuss under what conditions peace and stability can be restored&quot;. He said proposals for an African &quot; buffer force&quot; being discussed in Tripoli was a good idea &quot;in principle&quot; but said there was no reason to believe that such a force would suceed where a multi-national force had failed. Kamanda was interviewed by Radio France Internationale, South African radio and AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Organisation of African Unity special summit on the crisis of Zaire, March 18-19, will be held in Togo, the OAU announced yesterday. The summit is expected to address the possible deployment of an African buffer force between the warring parties in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In a speech to a formal session of the UN Security Council, US ambassador Bill Richardson warned Angolans against any involvement in the conflict in Zaire. Richardson did not specify whether the reference was to Angolan government forces of those of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas Savimbi. It is the first time the US has officially implied that Angolans are involved in the conflict. The international dimensions of the eastern Zaire conflict have not diminished; the remarks about Angolan involvement came on the same day that the Zairean government accused Uganda of amassing troops in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Field Coordinator for UNHCR based in Goma, Filippo Grandi, said yesterday that UNHCR &quot;categorically denies&quot; allegations that 500,000 Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire have been killed or have disappeared. Grandi told AFP in Goma that UNHCR would have known if massacres on a large scale had taken place, and said the international community &quot;should not play around with words as serious as 'genocide'&quot;. He said there was no doubt that some refugees had been killed, but &quot;there was nothing to prove organised massacres&quot; . He described the figure of 500,000 as &quot;pure fantasy&quot;. This week the Belgium Minister for Development and his spokesman said there are reports of &quot; genocidal acts&quot; in eastern Zaire, by rebels - although a statement by the Belgian Foreign Ministry later emphasized that the Belgian government was interested in reports of killings by all parties in Zaire. The French Foreign Ministry said yesterday that it considered the genocide reports &quot;reliable&quot; and called for an international enquiry. There has been no independent monitoring of human rights in rebel-held and government-controlled eastern Zaire to-date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* On February 26, the Cyangugu court in southwestern Rwanda, sentenced Thedodore Munyangabe to death and to pay compensation of more than 34 million Rwandan francs. He was found guilty of crimes of genocide and other crimes against humanity, reported state-run Rwandan radio. He has 15 days in which to appeal. Between 27 December and 18 February 1997, 18 judgements have been handed down in genocide trials. Eleven of these were death sentences, six were life imprisonments, and one was an acquittal, reports the UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (UNHRFOR). UNHRFOR, while welcoming the start of genocide trials has &quot;noted concerns&quot; regarding aspects of the proceedings, in particular the lack of legal representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest report from the UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (UNHRFOR) states that, since the beginning of January, &quot;the human rights and security situation has drastically deteriorated... in particular in the four prefectures bordering Zaire.&quot; UNHRFOR received reports of the killings of 424 Rwandans in 55 incidents. The report (UNHRFOR/UPD/13/2) indicates that at least 163 of these killings were allegedly perpetrated by agents of the state - 107 of which took place in the course of military operations in Ruhengeri.  The ex-FAR and Interahamwe militia are blamed with 42 killings - mostly of genocide survivors and witnesses. The UNHRFOR also reports that 99,300 persons were detained in central prisons and local detention centres at the end of January. These do not include detainees in military facilities, to which UNHRFOR does not have access.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The UN Secretary General's Special Representative for Burundi, Marc Faguy, left Burundi yesterday after months attempting to persuade Burundian leaders to pursue a political, non-military solution, and implement a ceasefire. He told journalists that Burundi leaders had expressed a willingness to negotiate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A US diplomat in Bujumbura said yesterday that deposed Burundian president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya was still residing in US embassy property. The former president's party, Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) said on Tuesday that Buyoya had persuaded Ntibantunganya to leave, reported AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni bet a journalist in March 1996 that rebel leader Joseph Kony would be killed or captured in about seven months; but he lost the $1,000 bet. &quot;Our work is to kill these people, and we shall crush them&quot;, Museveni announced at a press conference last March. The journalist reportedly declined the wager for lack of a stake, but has recieved the money in two installments from the president's office, the Monitor newspaper reported today. Journalist Tamale Mirundi recieved a million Ugandan shillings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Guguletu, Mitchells Plain and Atlantis are among nine areas targeted by the Western Cape Department of Economic Affairs for a new Local Economic Development (LED) programme aimed at job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a programme of promises but of delivery,&quot; department head Tony Ruiters said at a briefing yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LED programme was a key element in the province's economic policy, due to be released within two weeks, and would be developed in line with the Government's Growth, Employment and Redistribution (Gear) plan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The province was aiming for the creation of 50 000 permanent jobs a year by the year 2000, economic growth of 8 percent a year and the quadrupling of exports. The Western Cape government was confident that it could beat the national economic growth target of 6 percent a year &quot;by 1,5 percent or 2 percent&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nine areas targeted by the Led programme are Mossel Bay, Montagu-Ashton, Plettenberg Bay, Beaufort West, Vredendal, Genadendal, Mitchells Plain, Guguletu and Atlantis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ruiters said a profile of the population, including data on unemployment, age and economic activity was being drawn up for each area. Key growth industries in each area would be identified and skill shortages evaluated. A Local Business Service Centre would be set up by the provincial government in each area to boost the capacity of small and medium businesses and help them to network with each other and with bigger business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) incentives to small and bigger businesses would be used to attract investment to these areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The target towns would also be marketed abroad, said Mr Ruiters, with representatives taking part in any trade missions overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experience had shown that this was a good way to attract foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LED programme would fit in with the DTI's plans for local industrial parks, one of which is in Lansdowne-Guguletu, Mr Ruiters said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial Minister of Economic Affairs Chris Nissen said the LED programme was &quot;an economic solution to urbanisation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movement of people into Cape Town was not only from the Eastern Cape but also from smaller towns in the Western Cape, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By developing towns like Vredendal, Beaufort West, Plettenberg Bay and other towns in the Overberg, we are looking for an economic, rather than a political, solution to urbanisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nissen said he would soon be able to announce a major foreign investment in Mitchells Plain, most of it from Malaysia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A new railway station opposite Spier wine estate near Stellenbosch, linking the Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront to the Winelands, has been officially opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The construction of the Cape Dutch-style station was commissioned by Spier, using contractors from previously disadvantaged communities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intersite Property Management Services, the property arm of the SA Rail Commuter Corporation, was approached by Spier, which wanted a station close to the estate to enable people to catch the Spier steam train from the Waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lease agreement for the land on the railway reserve opposite the Spier estate was negotiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intersite regional manager Kevin Roman said the link-up with Spier was in line with the company's vision to transport people at any time - not just to and from work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiations were underway to extend the platform to accommodate a 12-coach commuter train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will open up the wine farm to local tourists who rely on trains for transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is also in line with our objective to facilitate maximum private sector involvement in the portfolios we manage,&quot; said Mr Roman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the new station this week, Western Cape Economic Affairs Minister Chris Nissen hailed it as an ideal illustration of the successful partnership which needed to be created between the state and the private sector in the development of the country's economy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - An ambitious upgrading programme will leave more than 1000 Metrorail train coaches vandal-proof and offer commuters a safer, more comfortable ride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upgrading at Transnet workshops will cost between R500 000 and R600 000 compared with R3-million for a new coach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first train complete with modernised coaches is expected to arrive in Cape Town from Gauteng by the end of the year, said Transnet's regional operations manager Piet Lotz.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Cape Town had been given a sneak preview of the prototype coaches in December when some were sent to the Peninsula. They were used during the visit by the International Olympic Committee's evaluation commission for the city's 2004 Olympic bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The modernised coaches differ from trains now in use in almost every respect except for their external appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seats in the upgraded coaches are more comfortable and vandal proof, and the floors are constructed with fire-retardant Finnish wood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Side and ceiling panels are made of fire-resistant mouldings and the coaches have improved lighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each coach also has a public address system installed to broadcast music.  The doors are tamper-proof and are equipped with panic buttons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The windows are shatterproof and baggage racks, previously constructed using aluminium and regularly vandalised, have been made with epoxy-coated steel which has very little scrap metal value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the coach is well ventilated and the windows let in air, they do not open wide enough to be used as an escape route by ticket dodgers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme is expected to take 15 years to complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The popular Changing City series run by the Cape Argus is also available on our Internet site. This is a valuable electronic record of the changes happening in our city as reported through our columns.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Democratic Party federal council this weekend will consider President Mandela's offer of a role in government. considers the arguments for and against acceptance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese custom is that it is rude to open a gift in front of the giver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is only once you get it home that you find out just what it is and whether it suits you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party has found itself in this position with President Mandela's offer of a role in government, frustrated beyond measure by the vagueness of it all.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be argued that even Mr Mandela himself had no clear position in mind when he made the offer and that it was merely in line with his oft-repeated statement that there were good people throughout the political spectrum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point of him repeating this message so often is a logical consequence of his new patriotism theme and a vision, as he articulated last weekend, of a Zimbabwe-style unity government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mandela's notion already has inspired extreme caution among the Pan Africanist Congress, a party with an even smaller share of the vote than the DP, which has rejected any suggestion of a merger with the African National Congress leviathan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where does the DP find itself as it gathers this weekend?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the party's strongest points is that it does not suffer the lack of identity or sense of division with which the National Party is burdened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a party of social democratic liberal values, with a long and proud tradition of articulating those values, and can claim with little fear of contradiction to speak on behalf of the interests of business, small and large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It speaks the language of those perturbed by perceptions of declining standards of morality and security, from a stronger moral platform than the NP, which daily is further besmeared by the revelations of the Truth Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its constituency consists mainly of people whose levels of education and wealth are well above average in an as-yet unreconstructed economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for all this, the DP stares at a bleak horizon when it considers its prospects of expansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been nothing to suggest it has made anything but the slightest inroads into the black electorate since 1994, a goal commonly acknowledged as essential to any party with plans to stay in business in the 21st Century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its existing constituency, of relatively wealthy middle-class whites, is undergoing attrition on three fronts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emigration, a low birth rate and the pattern displayed in other liberated African countries of whites becoming less involved in politics as they sense their importance dwindling, could mean fewer crosses next to the DP's name as election goes by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It must be said immediately that this very factor of alienation and disillusionment among its constituency could spell the DP's end if it accepts President Mandela's offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To lower the standard of liberal democracy to disappear into the camp of the majority party could be seen as nothing more than a cynical act of selling-out for which the party would pay dearly in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be handed a job on a commission, in any other government role, or - as slim as the chances might be - a position in the Cabinet and then perform at less than optimum would expose the party to ridicule from all sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC would be able to argue that the DP, its most piercing critics, had done no better in government than they; the NP would be able to accuse the DP of falling into all the traps which they themselves were said to have done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this is the argument of the DP agreeing to Mr Mandela's offer as a form of national service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument goes that all those at Kempton Park acceded to a deal to deliver each of their constituencies to sustain a stable and democratic transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DP and the NP were part of that deal, but the NP reneged when it left ahead of 1999 on a political whim of its own, however much the divorce may have been to the considerable relief of both parties at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus it falls to the DP to bring itself and its constituency into the engine room of the transition, rather than banging away discordantly outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other argument for acceptance is one which bears in mind the continuing precariousness of race relations, and the fact that the balm of reconciliation has a long way to go to healing the wounds of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the danger of a perpetuation of the racial polarisation of politics, a danger acknowledged by every party, if sometimes only - for the reasons outlined above - for the sake of their own survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the NP out of government, the new constitution having spelt an end to its prospects of ever forcing a return to a mandatory coalition and the Inkatha Freedom Party being widely perceived as having a specific ethnic base, the image of government is increasingly one of being black, ranged against an opposition which is overwhelmingly white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some may regard this perception as spurious, given the significant inroads the ANC has made into sections of the white population and the fact several of its leading MPs come from that community, as well as the NP's gains in the coloured community, it is a perception of unquestionable potential danger when viewed from the outside world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DP entry into government would strike a major blow against this perception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party could take its friends in business with it to the inner sanctums of power (which is, of course, not to say they do not already frequently drop in), earning the kudos of the middle-man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would be a major gain for the ANC, some of whose members frankly are frustrated at the party's failure to develop organic links with business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of all, in the federal council's warmest and farthest flights of fancy it could picture Tony Leon at the side of Nelson Mandela at a meeting in a township, which could do Comrade Tony's image no end of good in a constituency where he is seen as a retrogressive critic of transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against these visions, the party may balance memories of the fate of smaller parties seduced by larger ones, including that of the Labour Party and others, swallowed by the ANC in 1994, its most useful members kept on and the carcass of the party left by the wayside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DP may be well advised to take up Mr Mandela's offer and, by so doing, fulfil the goal of every party to have access to power; but before then, they will have to be rude and demand to know what is inside the mystery gift.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - There has been an outcry over the deportation to South Africa of paedophile Dennis Hundermark after he had served only three months of a 16- month prison sentence in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If paedophile Dennis Hundermark was considered dangerous enough to be deported from Britain to South Africa accompanied by three burly policemen, adequate forward planning should have been done to ensure that on arrival here he would pose no threat to the children of this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, a nightmare scenario unfolded. Hundermark, who has been described as a constant threat to young children and to himself, was released by the British authorities after having served less than one-fifth of a sentence on sex-related charges, and was delivered to freedom in Cape Town because there was no legal justification for detaining him in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This after he had admitted to bizarre fantasies in a British court, reportedly including the raping of toddlers, and after he had described himself as a &quot;speeding train&quot;; a person who was sick and in need of help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did this appalling incident come about? The British authorities, reportedly, were under the mistaken impression that Hundermark would be arrested on his arrival here. Was communication between the authorities of the two countries so poor that a potentially disastrous misunderstanding arose? Or, as some in South Africa might be tempted to suspect given Hundermark's astonishingly brief sojourn in prison, did the British authorities merely act precipitously to get rid of an awkward problem as quickly as they could?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public is entitled to answers, not only because of the danger to which children in South Africa might have been exposed by the release here of a self-confessed and dangerous paedophile, but also to ensure that this sort of incident does not recur. Given the potential in these matters for irrational emotions to be stirred, a calm and measured official investigation is called for.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Jacques Kallis can take great strides in making South Africa's troublesome No 3 batting position his own in the first test against Australia which began at the Wanderers today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 21-year-old Western Province batsman is the latest in a long line of guinea pigs who have been thrown into what has become South Africa's hot spot during the last few seasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last South African No 3 batsman to score a century was Hansie Cronje, who hit a memorable 122 in the corresponding test at the Wanderers against the 1994 Australians, but whose weakness against short-pitched bowling has seen him drop down the order.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then Brian McMillan, John Commins, Andrew Hudson, Daryll Cullinan, Herschelle Gibbs and Adam Bacher have all been tried in the first-drop position in tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kallis, recalled to the side for his first test of the season after playing two tests against England last summer, is aware of the heavy responsibility which rests on him occupying the pivotal position in the top-order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a lot of pressure on me because No 3 has been a problem area for the team but, without wanting to sound arrogant, I feel I can provide the answer,&quot; Kallis said .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel very comfortable at No 3 and just have to go out and be confident, and play like I've been playing all season.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Kallis made his test debut against England at Kingsmead last season, he made one batting at No 6, and then made just seven runs in 90 minutes while batting at No 7 at Newlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the team management obviously wanted to ease him into the side by batting him down the order, Kallis says he would have been happy to have been thrown in at the deep end straight away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I enjoy No 3 because the new ball goes off the bat quickly, and there are normally more gaps in the field when you come in. The bad balls usually go for four, and you can get full value for your strokes,&quot; Kallis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, there are disadvantages as well because if you nick one, the chances are there will be a third slip in place,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kallis said the fact that selection panel convener Peter Pollock had stated that he would bat at No 3 when the team was announced at the weekend had helped him mentally prepare for his role. &quot;It was nice to know I was in the 11 and not carrying the drinks again,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he didn't make a big score for Western Province when they played Australia a fortnight ago, Kallis spent almost three hours at the crease, which has made him a little more relaxed during the test build-up. &quot;I've seen how some of their bowlers have tried to bowl to me and restrict my scoring, so I've been able to work on that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMillan's absence also means he is likely to figure more on the bowling front than might otherwise have been the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Fanned by a gale, the inferno that has razed hundreds of hectares of fynbos and plantations near Somerset West today spread to the Stellenbosch side of the Hottentots Holland mountains</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fire operations centre has been set up at Mont Fleur, the highest farm in the Stellenrykkloof, which could be under threat if the fire heads down the valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been contained at Sir Lowry's Pass and the historic Vergelegen wine estate, but the 130km/h gale is making conditions difficult for firefighters, who are battling a wall of flames over a 7-8km front. Three helicopters poured water on the flames from first light today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferdi Mostert, civil protection officer with the Cape Metropolitan Council, said the fire was still burning fiercely in an SA Forestry Corporation bluegum plantation north-west of the Hottentots Holland mountains today.  Heavy smoke was making visibility difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damage estimates are not yet available. A spokesman for Water and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal said he hoped a figure would be available by the end of the weekend if the fire was finally contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for provincial Agriculture Minister Lampie Fick said the damage appeared to be confined to plantations and nature conservation areas, but an assessment could be done only once it was out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fire started on the Knorhoek farm on Monday, spreading to Vergelegen later that night. It has consumed hundreds of hectares of fynbos and plantations, but vineyards and orchards have been saved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Lourensford farm, big plantations owned by Safcor have been badly damaged and firefighters have been battling to contain the blaze there for two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don Tooth, general manager of Vergelegen, said today the fire was now being fought on the Stellenbosch and Somerset West side of the mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farmers in the area had been &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by the way the community had rallied to their assistance, he said. Besides assistance from the authorities, ordinary people had offered donations or helped by taking messages, answering phones and distributing goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Vergelegen the fire was contained at this stage but there were still hot spots in various areas being monitored carefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fire is nowhere near being put out. What we need is for the wind to drop. They are fighting a wall of fire over a good 7 to 8km front,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Cape Town firefighters, already stretched because of the Somerset West fire, fought a number of bush and grass fires in the Pensinula, including a blaze on Signal Hill, in the teeth of a gale in the past 24 hours.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA(ENA) - The Federal High Court yesterday heard testimonies given by five witnesses of the Special Prosecutor against the former Derg officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the witnesses said his son, Abrihe Bementu, had been detained in Harar where he used to work and was locked up at the Central Prison for nine months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abrihe has then been told that he was sentenced to five years term of imprisonment and was transferred to a jail in Addis Ababa, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness said his son spent four years at the Addis Ababa Prison before he was taken back to the Central prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had been delivering food to my son all through the years until the day I was told not to any more,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had learnt the death of his son after 1991 from a document found from the then Ministry of Internal Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness testified that his son, Seyoum Bekele, had been under arrest at a prison in Higher 02 Kebele 09 in 1970.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He (his son) told me that he was detained for allegedly being a member of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party (EPRP),&quot; the witness said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness said he had no idea as to whether Seyoum was alive or not since June 1979 when he was told by the prison officials not to bring any more food for his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness of the Special Prosecutor said he found his brother, Mekibib Kinfu jailed at the Central Prison in 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have never seen my brother since 1980. I only received his clothes and shoes he wore while he was in the prison,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fourth witness aged 51 said he had been thrown into jail for moths in 1979 without any warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was imprisoned at the Addis Ababa Prison up until October 1984 for allegedly being member of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He named nine people who he said had been summoned by the prison officials never to return again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fifth witness said in April 1977 four armed men held and drove him in a military Jeep to the Forth Army division where he said he was imprisoned for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he met six of his work mates at the Addis Ababa Prison where he was also thrown into. He called out the names of the individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have no idea why they had to lock me up,&quot; he said and pointed out that two of his colleagues had never shown up after they left the prison summoned by the prison officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial was adjourned until March 4.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - An academic of the Addis Ababa University has urged for the annulment of existing treaties between the lower riparian countries on the use of the Nile waters to pave the way for a basin-wide cooperating among the countries of the Nile Basin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Yakob Arsano, a political science lecturer at the Addis Ababa University made the suggestion in a paper presented Wednesday at the 5th Nile 2002 Conference under way here at the United National conference Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Riparian governments must henceforth believe and formally accept that the previous Nile water agreements are not only unfair, but also have been detrimental to the sovereign rights of the upper riparian countries.  Therefore they be done null and void&quot;, Ato Yacob said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further noted that the treaties between down stream countries, I.e.  Egypt and Sudan or their colonizers, were made without any consideration for the interest and rights of upper riparian countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The upper riparian countries, which almost contribute the entire waters of the Nile, are Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Eritrea, Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All previous and existing treaties were designed in the colonial vain and legacy of it&quot;, Ato Yacob said adding that &quot;the treaties have totally shunned the interest and water rights of the upper riparian&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As things stand now, and with the increase of population within the basin, which is anticipated to triple between 1990 and 2025, the situation is more contentious than is conducive for cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demand for water, infact, is soaring beyond the available water resources in the entire basin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The projected annual water need for Egypt and Sudan for irrigation is 65.5 billion cubic metre (BCM) and 31.15 BCM respectively, Ato Yacob said and noted that this is about 12.26 BCM greater than the total available water in the basin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a clear indication that when all the riparian states come up with their respective national water master plan, the available water resources and the national demands will be at irreconcilable variance&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Yacob's suggestions were strongly reufted by delegates from Sudan and Egypt. One delegate from the Sudan, infact said that the suggestions were rather a reciepy for conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another proposal forwarded by the academic to prevent contentions and possible conflicts was the establishment of a basin wide legal regime on the basis of which all water matters shall be regulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 5th Nile 2002 conference wound up yesterday with a keynote address by Vice Minister of Water Resources Ato Adbulreshid Dulene. We will come up with the detailed story of the conference in tomorrow's issue of the herald.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intellectuals' conference underway in Tigray</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAKALLE (ENA) - More is expected of intellectuals to alleviate the socio- economic problems of the rural peoples in Tigray, head of the regional state stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening a conference of intellectuals' here Wednesday Ato Gebru Asrat said intellectuals deployed in rural areas are expected to change the lives of inhabitants without aspiring to work only in urban centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ato Gebru, intellectuals assigned in rural areas are engaged in the education, health, agricultural and other sectors, in addition to conducting research and formulating directives in a bid to alleviate socio- economic problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regional head of state said intellectuals should contribute toward the expansion of irrigation development, capacity building and the implementation of the five-year development programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five hundred intellectuals drawn from regional bureaux, zones, woredas, as well as government and NGO offices are taking part in the conference focusing on extension service, potable water supply and other development activities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong arrived in Harare Friday on a three-day official visit to Zimbabwe which will culminate in the signing of a bilateral agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tong is accompanied by an 80-member delegation of government officials and businessmen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the delegation said the business people were interested in investment and trade with Zimbabwe in areas such as infrastructure development, food processing, information technology and clothing manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tong is expected to fly to the northern resort town of Victoria Falls on Saturday. Before leaving Sunday, he and Mugabe will sign an agreement, still to be negotiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe and Singapore enjoy good trade relations although the balance of trade favors Singapore. In 1995, Zimbabwe imported goods worth 7.3 million U.  S. dollars from Singapore, while it exported goods worth six million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two countries signed an air services agreement in 1996 to improve trade and boost tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe has made a determined drive in Asia to woe investments to Zimbabwe.  He led a Zimbabwean business delegation to Malaysia, Singapore's neighbor, in 1994. Malaysia's President has also visited Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaysia Airlines has opened a representative office in Zimbabwe, as part of a strategy to spread its wings in this region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To entice investors, Mugabe's government in 1994 reduced company tax by 2.5 percent to 37.5 percent and removed customs duty on capital goods.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Delegates from 60 countries ended their fourth international NGO conference on land mines Friday asking governments to commit themselves signing an international treaty banning all production, use and sale of the weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That treaty is due to be signed in December. That is when governments in favor of a ban will meet in the Canadian capital, Ottawa. A draft ban treaty, drawn up by the Austrian government, already exists. Belgium and Norway will host treaty negotiating sessions in June and September.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final declaration of the Maputo conference urged governments &quot;to open all meetings of the Ottawa process to participation by a delegation from the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, and to invite NGO representatives to form part of government delegations to these meetings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants urged governments, even before any treaty negotiations, to take unilateral measures to ban mines. By this measure they would be following the examples, set in February, of South Africa and Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such unilateral measures, the delegates said, would &quot;build momentum towards the signing of the Ottawa treaty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One problem looming is the definition of an anti-personnel mine. The conference wanted to block loopholes: it called for &quot;a simple, clear and unambiguous treaty that bans all anti-personnel land mines, and not just those weapons 'primarily designed' or adapted to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speakers warned against diluting any treaty with the &quot;primarily designed&quot; clause. This, they said, would allow governments to continue under the pretext that they were not &quot;primarily designed&quot; to be exploded by human contact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final declaration at Muputo also called on those countries that have produced and supplied mines &quot;to accept their responsibility and to assist with clearance and victim assistance programs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference wanted greatly increased resources for mine clearance &quot; particularly in those nations and regions that have banned the weapon.&quot; The conference was focussed on making Southern Africa mine-free. During the week significant steps were taken towards this goal. On the first day of the conference the Mozambican government announced its ban on anti-personnel mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swazi and Malawian representatives said their governments were committed to the Ottawa process, while a letter form the Tanzanian foreign minister pledged that country's support. A Zimbabwean representative said the government in Harare would shortly make its position known, and he specifically denied the frequent claim that Zimbabwe manufactures mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support was also forthcoming from the Angolan parliament but the position of the Angolan government is still unknown. Angola, as the most heavily mined country in Africa, is crucial to the campaign -- particularly as there are credible reports that mines are still being laid there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the conference, Gil Manuel, a spokesman for the Mozambican Campaign Against Land Mines, which hosted the event, was supportive of Mozambique's position but warned that more needed to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, he wanted all stocks of land mines held by the Mozambican Defence Force destroyed at a public ceremony. Furthermore, he wants a law banning mines to be passed by the country's parliament, the Assembly of The Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the head of the parliamentary group of the ruling Frelimo party, Armando Guebuza, said that Frelimo deputies might sponsor such legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coordinator of the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, Jody Williams, described the conference as &quot;a great success,&quot; noting that initially only 300 delegates had been expected -- but 450 actually turned up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She warned that Ottawa was not the end of the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A ban is not just a treaty,&quot; she said. &quot;It means ensuring universal adherence to the treaty, removing all the mines already in the ground, and repairing the lives of the victims. That work will not end when we sign the treaty in Ottawa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the Organization of African Unity's Council of Ministers that while President Tejan Kabba's government had demonstrated good faith, the front continued to hamper the implementation of the November 1996 peace agreement signed in Cote d'Ivoire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, she said, while the government had released all of the front's soldiers held prisoner, the front was still holding school children &quot; adopted&quot; during fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the front's insistence, Bougana said foreign mercenary troops had also left Sierra Leone, to pave way for the 1996 election. The polls, which brought Kabbah to power, were conducted with the help of the O.A.U., the Commonwealth and Cote d'Ivoire, which hosted the peace meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She described as a good sign, the front's acceptance of the deployment of the U.N. proposed 750 international peace monitors in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, she asked the international community to support the trust fund set up to consolidate the peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - Nigeria has urged that the momentum of ongoing Liberian peace plan be sustained to prevent the war-torn country from relapsing into another avoidable carnage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation should not be seen as all clear, it is still volatile,&quot; Tom Ikimi, the country's foreign minister, told PANA Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria is current chairman of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), which has a peace monitoring force, Ecomog, in Liberia, trying to end a seven-year-old civil war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi said although some progress had been recorded, based on the Abuja 1995 and 1996 peace plan, the &quot;stages ahead are very crucial and delicate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that while some 28,000 of the estimated 35,000 factional fighters had been disarmed, an undisclosed quantity of arms were still to be retrieved.  He warned about the danger of these weapons finding their way into the hands of the former combatants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the peace accord brokered by Ecowas, national elections are to be held in May to be conducted by a 10-member Independent Electoral Commission.  It would include one member each from the Organization of African Unity (O.A.  U.), Ecowas and the United Nations, while others would be drawn from the former factions and the civil population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi projected that if the plan went well Ecomog, numbering 8,980 men a week ago and being reinforced with about 2,500 more troops, would begin a total pull out from Liberia six months after the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said another problem could be the fate of some 800,000 Liberian refugees scattered across West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commending the O.A.U., U.N. and the international community for their help in resolving the crisis in Liberia, Ikimi said the displaced people should be supported to return home to participate in the electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ECOMOG still suffers some inadequacies and we appeal to the international community to assist the peace process on Liberia,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia, founded in 1847 by freed slaves from the United States slipped into civil war following the Dec. 24, 1989 rebellion by Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia against the government of President Samuel Doe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 150,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the war.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - Thousands of Libyans, mainly youths, marched through Alfatha street in Tripoli on Thursday, venue of the 65th ministerial council meeting of the Organization of Africa Unity, in support of African solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The placard-carrying marchers also condemned the sanctions imposed on their country by the United Nations since 1992.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the placards read: &quot;All Libyans Pay Tribute To Africa's Free Will&quot;, &quot;Africa is for Africans,&quot; and &quot;No Alliance With Africa Except With Itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the statement issued by the popular congresses, on behalf of all Libyans, the marchers said the presence of at least 30 African ministers at the meeting was &quot;a defeat for America and its allies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministers and their delegations, as well as O.A.U. Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim, broke the session briefly to greet the marchers, who demanded an end to U.N. sanctions on Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanctions were imposed after the United States and Britain accused two Libyan nationals of involvement in the downing of a PanAm jetliner in 1988, over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tripoli has rejected U.S. demand that the suspects be tried in America or Britain but said they could face trial at the World Court at the Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sanctions have dealt a serious blow to the economy of the oil-producing north African country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - The Organization of African Unity, the continent's foremost political body, called Friday for an urgent reform of the United Nations Security Council to make it more representative of the world and protect the interests of Africa and other marginalized continents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is of serious concern, it is not clear when or how it will happen but it must happen,&quot; said Salim Ahmed Salim, the organization's secretary-general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference in Tripoli, where is attending the organization's Council of Ministers meeting, he described the U.N. as a product of the Second World War. Just two African countries, Libya and Ethiopia were members when the United Nations was set up in 1946. Today, there were 53 African countries representing some one-third of the 186-member world body.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only Africa but other countries have concern in relating with the world's sole super power, the United States,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the present circumstance, he said, Africa must be able to respond more swiftly and effectively to its challenges. But, he said it was regrettable that the O.A.U. lacked the capacity to give teeth to its decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim outline the organization's efforts to resolve the Africa's myriad conflicts, especially in the Great Lakes region, the Horn of Africa, Angola, Burundi, Liberia, and the dispute between Libya and France, Britain and United States over the 1988 downing of PanAm jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, and a jetliner belonging to the private French carrier, UTA, over Niger in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya is facing U.N. sanctions over its refusal to surrender for trial, in either United States or Britain, two of its nationals accused for the bombings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said while the O.A.U. condemned terrorism, it disagreed with the insistence that the suspects be tried only in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We stand for justice and this means that the suspects could be tried in a neutral country,&quot; as proposed by Libya, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another alternative, Salim said, was for them to face trial at the Hague or the Security Council could set up a tribunal to end the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said the presence of some 43 foreign ministers for the organization's council meeting in Tripoli was a demonstration of solidarity with Libya over the U.N.'s unfair sanctions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - Optimism that the two sides in the eastern Zaire conflict would soon hold peace talks was dampened Friday following reports that the envoy who met President Nelson Mandela over the issue was not empowered to negotiate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African television reported that the Zairian government had announced that Honore Ngabanda, although an envoy of President Mobutu Sese Seko, was not a member of government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">As such, he was not empowered to negotiate on the question of peace negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela met Ngabanda on Thursday, a day after the South African leader's audience with the Zairian anti-government leader, Laurent Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both talks were aimed at trying to get the two sides to be involved in peace talks which officials hoped would lead to a cease-fire in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, after Thursday's meeting, Mandela was noncommittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All I want to say is that there is progress which is encouraging,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expectations are that will be an official reaction from the South African government later Friday, before Mandela leave the country on an Asian tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, his absence for the next 10 days has also dampened hopes of any immediate success in the Zairian peace initiative. No major developments are expected until his return to South Africa at the end of next week.</SPAN></P>
